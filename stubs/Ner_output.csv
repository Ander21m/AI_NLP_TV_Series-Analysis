16,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 This is good!
 Bit by bit,I'm figuring out the timing...
 He read my movement.
 No way could he do that!
 Darn! 					We were so close...!
 Naruto, can you still move?
 Of course! I'm totally fine!
 He's pretty much spent...and it's no wonder.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu usesa lot of Chakra.
 But thanks to him, we found our way out.
 I found the way to break through!
 Hah! Impossible!
 That was just a coincidence.
 Naruto! Run!
 Run out of here andattack from the outside!
 A-All right!
 You won't be able to…!
 I-I'm not going to lose!
 There!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Darn!
 T-That was good just now!
 What?
 We're doing it one more time!
 All right!
 It's likely that there's a limitto that guy's Chakra, too!
 To prove that,he's little by little…
 This won't go as you've planned.
 First, I'll get you!
 Sasuke!
 Darn! It's been a while sinceI've fought in such bad conditions.
 And I'm worried aboutSasuke and Naruto, too...
 Be calm…Think...What will he come after?
 Oh no!
 What?!
 Too late!
 The Broken Seal
 That was Sakura's voice!
 Did something happen?
 What's that Kakashi doing?
 Sa…kura…
 Darn it… I must do something…
 I'll do something about it…
 T-This guy...
 Here I go…
 It's pointless to struggle.
 Naruto, behind you!!
 Naruto!
 It's impossible for youto get out of here.
 I mean it.
 Can you stand up, Naruto?
 Y-Yeah…
 From now on,don't waste your Chakra!
 You're playing right into his hands.
 I know.
 Darn it!
 If things continue like this,it's going to be really bad.
 I...
 I have to do something.
 Strangely, my eyes have adjusted…
 It's about the time I putan end to this for you…
 What?!
 Stand up, you idiot!
 I'm aiming for a vital spot...but he's parrying all of them .
 I know…you're so persistent!
 A coincidence…No, that's not it.
 On the contrary, he's fightingwhile covering for his friend.
 Surely, my movements…
 That boy…he can see something.
 What in the world...?
 Okay, in that case...
 He disappeared.
 Where, where did he disappear to?!
 Naruto! Don't faint!
 I can't take care of youany more than I am now!
 Who asked you to take care of me...
 It seems that kid hasreached his limits.
 Tsk...
 Amazing…That's an amazing move.
 You move well…
 Wha--?!
 But I'll stop youwith the next one.
 Motor function...
 Reflexes...Ability to judge a situation...
 All of these things…should be at their limits!
 He's coming!
 Calm down…
 Focus!
 And … 					See everything!
 He saw through absolutely everything?!
 No way…
 Those eyes…
 It can't be…
 Sharingan…
 You are…
 Only a little, but...
 I was able to see!
 So, you also have the powerof Kekkei Genkai…
 What a kid…
 It's not perfect yet,
 but to think that in the middle of a battlehe was able to rouse this power…
 If that's the case,I can't fight him too long…
 This Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
 There are also limits to retainingthe teleportation speed.
 Besides, the longer the fight continues,
 the more my movements will enterinto the range of his ""reading.""
 In fact, his eyeshave already captured me.
 It would be foolish to aimstraight at him.
 In that case…
 I'll use that kid to lure him in!
 What?!
 Let me make it in time!
 K-Kakashi Sensei!
 You were late enteringto guard, Kakashi.
 Your whole-hearted intent to helpthose kids has gone to your head,
 and it seems to have cloudedyour Sharingan
 with even heavier fog.
 Even though you havethose impressive eyes,
 your ability to read your enemy'smovements is getting cloudy.
 Amuse me more, Kakashi…
 I want to repay my debt inan amusing way.
 Don't worry. Anytime now,Haku is going to defeat those kids.
 You better apologize to themin tears
 when you are in ""the next world""for your lack of strength.
 Sasuke will be defeated…?
 That's not true!
 Sasuke is…
 Cha!
 Not by that guy!
 Cha!
 He won't be defeated!
 Cha!
 Naruto won't either!
 That's right.
 Huh!
 I...believe in their strength.
 Naruto is the Number One Hyperactive,Knucklehead Ninja…
 And Sasuke is a member ofthe most excellent clan
 in the Hidden Leaf Village!
 That can't be!
 Yes…His name is Sasuke Uchiha…
 He bears within his body...
 the famous Kekkei Genkaiof the Uchiha clan!
 He's a Ninja genius.
 He's the remaining survivorof that tragic clan?!
 No wonder he grows so quickly.
 But...
 That's the same as Haku.
 Nobody has ever beatenthat secret Jutsu of Haku's
 Not one person in the past…
 Well then…
 It's about time I settled this too, huh.
 Sakura, don't move from here.
 Uh... ah…okay!
 No, I'm going to putan end to this!
 For God's sake, you…
 just won't quit…dragging my feet, will you?
 You did it! 					Sasuke...!
 W-What kind of expressionis that…
 You…idiot…!
 W-Why?!
 You protected me…?!
 How the hell…should I know?
 Sasuke...! Sasuke...! Sasuke...!
 Hmph…
 You...
 I hated you…
 Why? Why…?
 Why…me…?
 I didn't ask for your help!!
 I don't know…
 My body moved…of its own accord…
 Fool…!
 Sasuke!
 That man…
 Until I defeated…my brother…
 I absolutely refused to die...
 That's what I decided, but...
 You, don't die…
 He…
 To protect someone dear to him…
 he would plunge inknowing it was a trap…
 He's a Shinobi worthy of respect.
 Is this the first time you faceda friend's death?
 This is the way of the Shinobi…
 Shut up!
 Even though I...hated you too…
 I won't forgive you…
 I'm going to kill you!
 What is this Chakra?!
 It can't be…
 For Chakras to be tangible like that…
 A-And…what a ghastly Chakra that is…
 The wound on his hand…lt's healing instantly…
 This boy…
 Who in hell is he…?
 Is it Zabuza…?
 No!
 This sinister Chakra was once…
 It can't be!
 What is…this Chakra?
 It feels foul…
 Kakashi?No, it's too big to be Kakashi's…
 Who is it?
 Naruto…!
 Oh no…
 At the time like this…
 The seal has broken…?
 I have to hurry!
 He's coming!
 How dare you!
 You ruined Sasuke!Damn you!
 Sasuke's dream…
 What about dream?!
 Darn you! Darn you! Darn you!
 Because of your dream…!

216,"Summoning Jutsu!
 Oh, long time no see.
 We don’t have much timeto get nostalgic.
 We’ve got a mission.
 That I see over thereis the Village of Artisans, isn’t it?
 Yeah. It’s a village of professionalswho develop Ninja tools.
 The exceptional Ninja toolsthey develop are also
 supplied to usin the Five Great Nations…
 But there’s beena strange rumor recently.
 A strange rumor?
 Something about them developingthe ultimate weapon
 and attempting to antagonizethe Five Great Nations.
 In other words, we shouldsearch the village and…
 verify whether or notthere is that ultimate weapon, right?
 That’s about the size of it.
 Piece of cake.
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 The distance created between usbecame too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouthmakes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile,even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Hey! Something strange is going on.
 What is it?!
 There’s not a soul in the village!
 I also found something terribleon top of that.
 What?!
 It’s that.
 The coffin of Seimei, the founder ofthe Village of Artisans.
 Even his body is…
 This is serious.
 The artisans abandoned their village.Where in the world did they go?
 The Targeted Shukaku
 I’m hungry, I’m hungry!
 Maybe I’ll treat myself and havetwo eggs in my ramen today.
 Huh?
 What’s going on there?!
 Did I keep you waiting by any chance?
 Not really. I just got here a bit before.
 That’s good… Then, here.
 I made sure to hand it to you.
 Yeah, yeah. What a pain.
 Just a minute!
 What’re you guys doing…
 all in secret in a place like thiswithout even asking me?!
 –Naruto? 					–Huh?
 You’re terrible, just terrible, Sakura!
 Here you won’t even go outon a date with me at all!
 Why're you talking gibberishall of a sudden?
 Ouch-ouch-ouch-ouch…
 An errand for the Old Lady?
 Yes. It seems a new poisonwas discovered or something.
 I delivered a list ofresearch medicinal substance
 for Shikamaru’s father to prepare.
 Oh, that’s it?!
 Jeez, you jump to conclusions.
 Oh, come to think of it,
 an update report from Temarihas been delivered to Lady Tsunade.
 An update report?
 So? What exactly?
 I heard that the Village Hidden inthe Sand started Ninja education,
 imitating the curriculum programof the Leaf’s.
 It seems that Temari and her brothersare working as instructors.
 Instructors?!
 Is that harsh woman fit to besomething like an instructor…?
 Really? That Gaara, huh…?
 This is hands-on training.
 Choose from among thesea Ninja tool that suits you.
 What is it?
 Do we absolutely have to choose?!
 What do you mean?
 We’ll end up hurting the other personif we use a weapon.
 We might kill them.
 A weapon is…
 No, never mind…
 A mission isn’t a game.
 If you were to enter a field of battlewith that frame of mind, you'd die.
 I-I’m sorry.
 You got Gaara angry becauseyou ask stupid questions.
 You are in trouble.
 The three of us will conducthands-on training.
 Gather in the respective classof your choice.
 Gaara, put a smile on!
 They'll get scared and nobody willchoose you with that sulky look.
 My dad said that Gaarawas the Sand’s ultimate weapon.
 Yeah. He's so powerful that the villagewould be destroyed, if he got mad.
 He’s scary, so let’s not bother.
 All right, I’m with Temari.
 I’ll be with Kankuro!
 – Me too! 					– Me too!
 – Me too! 					– Me too!
 Please be my teacher.
 Earlier, he was trying toteach me something…
 Excuse me… Please be my teacher.
 Are you okay with me?
 Please teach me!
 This is cool.
 That’s too big!
 I’ll take this.
 What’s your name?
 I’m Matsuri.
 Matsuri, choose a weapon.
 What’s the matter?
 Come at me with that weaponwith the intent to kill me.
 Yes, sir…
 They say an ogre with Iron Clubis invincible. But you are no ogre.
 Yes, sir. Please tell mewhat I should choose.
 The weapon called the Rope Javelin.
 Rope Javelin…
 The sharp blade on the end of the rope
 is to keep an enemy out of one's reach,rather than for attack.
 And you seal off an enemy’s movementwith the rope.
 Practice until you can control itas a part of your body.
 Yes, sir!
 Damn. Who are you guys?!
 Is this allthe Sand Village Shinobi have?
 Wait.
 Leave this guy alive.We can use him to draw that one out.
 Hang in there! What is it?!What happened?
 Take me to Gaara… Quickly.
 What’s the matter?
 My mother and father were hit withcountless weapons right in front of me.
 So I…
 For what purposedo you hold a weapon?
 He…
 What are…
 …these two to you?!
 Th-These guys are…
 …my friends!
 Try laying so much asanother finger on them!
 I’ll clobber you!
 He said that to me.
 That’s what we’re after: Gaara.
 Gaara, we werejust coming to get you.
 The patrol Ninja wasattacked by somebody.
 Guys calling themselvesThe Four Celestials
 brandishing strange weapons,said to tell Gaara that…
 ""We declare a challenge to you,the ultimate weapon.
 ""If you don’t accept the challenge,
 ""we will take away one personclose to you every day…
 ""and they shallpay the price for you.""
 You there.
 Are you Gaara’s student?
 You shall be the first sacrifice.
 What’s this Rope Javelin?!
 Wait!
 The enemy went northeast…
 Matsuri has become a first sacrifice…
 But the real target of the guys whocall themselves the Four Celestials is…
 you, Gaara.
 Yeah…
 This must be brought toa Jonin Council at once…
 In the northeastern direction
 where the ones who call themselvesthe Four Celestials left,
 there is the Village Hidden in the Leavesof the Land of Fire,
 with the Land of Riverssandwiched between.
 Therefore, we will be requestingthe assistance of the Leaf…
 Temari, Kankuro, Gaara.
 Form a unit and prepare forpursuit immediately.
 Hold it.
 The enemy is after Gaara.
 That would be like walkingright into a trap they laid.
 That’s right.Why won’t you send a party?!
 It might be a diversionary tacticby the enemy.
 The village will become shorthandedif we send out pursuers.
 Then you at least couldcome with us, right, Baki?!
 Most likely, the enemy isafter Shukaku.
 Gaara is the Sand’s ultimate weapon.
 If we know that…
 But it's also a dangerousdouble-edged sword to the village.
 If they would do us the favorfacing each other and perishing…
 Then at leastI should go with them.
 No. You have a different mission.
 Just send those three!
 Hey, how about it?!
 I’ve been givena different mission, you see…
 Go. She’s your student, right?
 Let’s go, Kankuro.
 Will it be okay with her?!
 She’s just a kid.
 Will he come?!
 If he doesn’t come, we’ll just sacrificethose close to him one after another.
 That is…?
 It’s a message from the Sand Village!
 Gaara? Why?
 Who knows?The goal is a challenge to Gaara.
 The hostage is a Ninja school student.
 The enemy is escaping in the direction ofthe Land of Fire from the Land of Rivers.
 Gaara, Temari and Kankuro arechasing after them.
 At this point, that’s all we know.
 You want me to set up an operationto stop the overconfident jerks
 who challenged Gaarajust with that information?
 Yeah. We’re on friendly termswith the Sand Village, so.
 Just a minute.
 They came during the Sasuke incidentwith much less information than now.
 Things are more bothersomethan that time!
 Our range would widen significantlyif we ambushed them
 instead of pursuing them.
 There’s also the incident in questionin the Village of Artisans,
 and the Jonin and Chuninare all away…
 – Shizune… 					– Yes, ma’am!
 Those are the only Geninwe can use now.
 Take the Genin you want to use
 and leave the villagewithin thirty minutes!
 Sakura’s name isn’t on here.
 Yeah. She’s doingMedical Ninjutsu training now, so.
 I’ll accept the mission.But I have one condition.
 Please let me borrow Sakura.
 Sakura?
 It’s almost time!ls this everyone, Shikamaru?!
 One person still hasn’t come.
 Could that be…?
 Sorry to keep you waiting!
 I can’t do a mission hungry.So I stopped by Ichiraku for a bit.
 What?! That's not fair just yougetting to eat! I'll also…
 All right! Now we’ve gotall our members together! We’re off!
 Huh? What? This is it?!
 I'd heard this was an operationwith a mobilization
 of the Geninremaining in the village!
 This is everyone, I tell you!
 That’s messed up!
 Setting aside Sakura who’s training,
 there should still beShino, Neji and Hinata!
 No mistake. It’s weird Akamaru and Ibeing the only Ninja
 with search ability.
 So is this teama go-for-it super attack-type?
 Yeah. I name usTeam Return the Favor.
 What lame naming!
 The guys from the Sand Villagehelped us during the Sasuke incident!
 In a manner, this operation will bereturning the favor from that time!
 All right! Guys, let’s make sure toreturn the favor from that time.
 You’re not the leader!
 Shikamaru the Chunin is the leaderof this platoon, right?!
 That’s right…
 Jeez, then let’s settle on a strategyand get going as soon as possible.
 Are we going in one lineas we did for the Sasuke incident?
 There’s no doubting the conditionsare similar to the Sasuke incident.
 However, the strategies for pursuitand ambush are completely different!
 We can’t follow them with Byakuganor by using Akamaru’s nose.
 No mistake about that.
 It’s unconventional, but since these areall the people we’ve got,
 we’ll act in groups of two basisas Two-Man Cells.
 Solo action is prohibitedno matter what the case!
 We owe a debt to the Ninja inthe Sand Village.
 However, although this is to repay a debt,no way will we produce casualties!
 Yeah, I got it.
 – Follow me, Ino. 					– Right!
 Choji, you go with Kiba…
 I’m counting on you, Choji, Akamaru.
 Right…
 Lee, you’re with Naruto…
 Right. Please refrainfrom selfish actions.
 You don’t need to remind me like that.
 Also, the four people Naruto mentionedearlier have left before us.
 Four people, do you meanShino, Neji, Hinata and Sakura?
 Yeah. The four will begoing their separate ways
 and won’t take part in future battles!
 Why not?!
 Isn’t that an incredible wasteof battle strength?!
 In place of that, we get a wider rangeof search action…
 And we’ll have them focus onmedical action in the case of battle starting.
 I have been entrusted with your livesand this is my strategy!
 All right, just wait, Gaara!
 I’ll make sure to return the favor!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 One of the enemies uses wind, huh?lnteresting. I will be her opponent!
 Then I’ll take on the guy who brandishesthe sword that looks like a kid’s toy.
 We’ll take care of this.You go ahead, Gaara.
 But, will it be okay?
 We don’t need your helpto deal with these chumps.
 You hurry, Gaara. That girl isyour student, isn’t she?

 Yes.
 You too, Lady Tsunade?
 Well, I guess…
 She just doesn’t want to stayin the executive office…
 Shut up!
 Hinata, don’t faint whenyou see Kurenai Sensei.
 P-Please let's not talk about that.
 Did something happen?
 When we were visiting Narutoin the hospital in the past…
 Shino!
 This girl fainted when she saw Narutoall covered with bandages.

 The Search forthe Rare Bikochu Beetle
 Hey, you woke up.
 So Mizuki didn’t know anything,you said?
 Tsunade interrogated him herself.
 He didn’t have any information
 that would lead to Orochimaru’scurrent whereabouts…
 After all, that guy was nothing buta disposable pawn to Orochimaru, huh.
 So it seems…
 We still don’t know whereSasuke went…
 And that’s the result aftera desperate fight with Mizuki…
 That can’t sit right withNaruto either…huh?
 Please Old Lady Tsunade,say it’s okay!
 When I say no, I mean no!
 As a result, Lady Tsunade wasn’t ableto concentrate on her work.
 Naruto’s been breathing downher neck the whole time
 asking her to let him go offin search of Sasuke.
 So she sneaked outof her office, but…
 He was lying in wait for her here.
 Naruto…
 I’ve asked you numerous times already!
 Please let me go in searchof Sasuke!
 I’ve told you numerous times already.lmpossible!
 Why!
 You have some training to do!
 I can’t because Pervy Sageisn’t around!
 We have zero leads on eitherOrochimaru and Sasuke.
 So how are you planningto search for him?
 I can figure it out somehow!
 If there aren’t any leads,I’ll go find some!
 So please let me go do it!
 You’re stubborn, aren't you?
 You’re stubborn too,Old Lady Tsunade!
 – Please let me go!– No, you may not!
 If I say I’m going, I’m going!
 Shut up! No means no!
 Byakugan!
 All right! Good work, Neji!
 Move in another half stepright there!
 Yes sir!
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 Let’s take a break, Neji.
 Yes.
 Have some tea too.
 Thank you…
 If Hinata was here,she should have observed a little.
 Hinata prepared this…?
 It would supplement her trainingby observing…
 Byakugan!
 Let’s take a break.
 Yes.
 Food! Food!
 That was pretty well done.
 I would say that you’re getting closerto perfecting the technique.
 It’s thanks to you both.
 You’re so kind to join mein my special training every day…
 We’re a team.
 When a comrade in the teamis in a fix,
 one offers a helping hand.
 That’s only natural…
 A comrade…
 If a comrade suddenly disappears,
 it must be awfully hard.
 You’re talking about Naruto,aren’t you?
 Isn't there some waywe could help him?
 I’d like to help him out insome way too…but…
 Lady Hokage was telling Naruto…
 that there are no leads at all.
 There may be one resource…
 Really?!
 I’m talking about Bikochu.
 Bikochu?
 Are you talking aboutthose rare insects…?!
 I have heard that they hadbecome extinct some time ago.
 Since there was a possibilitythat they could become extinct,
 the Aburame Clan discontinuedusing them,
 so a miniscule number of themshould still be alive.
 Lady Tsunade, what are Bikochu?
 Well…it’s not surprising thatyou don’t know about them.
 The last time that Bikochuwere used
 was before the last Great War…
 Bikochu are one kind of insectused by insect handlers.
 Larvae which have hatched from eggsbecome chrysalises in no time at all,
 then emerge and turninto imagos.
 They are then made torecognize scents…
 and they are able to trackeven the faintest scent…
 to its source.
 Their olfactory sense is several thousandtimes greater than a Ninja Hound's.
 They are insects capable ofexhibiting that skill in an exceptional way.
 However, Bikochu lay eggsonly once every several years…
 This year is actually the yearin which they lay eggs.
 And right now is exactlythe time when they hatch.
 I see.
 There are still some ofSasuke’s belongings left in the village…
 Right?
 If one makes the Bikochu,recognize that scent…
 We may be able to locateSasuke’s whereabouts, right?
 What is the probabilityof finding a Bikochu?
 Frankly speaking, not very high.Perhaps 10%.
 10% huh…
 As you guys know,
 the situation in the villageis currently very grave…
 We don’t have the leeway of allowingeven Genin to sit around and play.
 However, fortunately or unfortunately,Kurenai has been hospitalized,
 so you guys, Squad Eight,no longer have a mission.
 Rather than just lettingyou sit around and play,
 I’d rather place my beton that 10% possibility.
 Huh… you mean…
 Shino Aburame. Kiba Inuzuka.Hinata Hyuga.
 I order you to search forthe Bikochu!
 – All right! 					– All right!
 I designate Shinoas the leader this time.
 And…that spy up there!
 Oww…!
 Naruto…
 You’re going to go even ifI try to stop you, right?
 Yup!
 In that case, I have no choicebut to let you go…
 However…
 This is your last chance.
 If you don’t find the Bikochu…
 you must give up on Sasuke!
 Wha--?
 You understand?!
 It’ll be fine…I’ll find it without fail.
 All right. You won’t go backon your word, right?
 Yeah! Leave it to me!
 You’re easily pleased, aren’t you?
 Owww!
 Naruto…
 Sasuke…
 Hinata.
 Good morning.
 Neji will be here soonfor his training…
 Please prepare tea as always.
 Well…
 Huh? What’s the matter?
 I need to go…on a mission starting now…
 A mission, huh…
 In that case, it can’t be helped…
 I’m heading out…
 Don’t be a burden to the others.
 Yes, sir!
 I’m…I’m sorry! I’m in a hurry…
 The way she handledher physical response just now…
 Hinata…
 You’re late, Hinata!
 I’m sorry!
 All right then! Let’s head out!
 Let’s go!
 Huh?
 Why are you walking atsuch a leisurely pace?!
 It takes a Shinobi two days on foot
 to get to the habitat ofthe Bikochu …
 There’s no need to make hastefrom the very start.
 But what if the eggs hatchbefore we get there?
 The eggs of Bikochu only hatchon the day after it’s rained…
 There’s no sign of itraining any time soon…
 But…if by some remote chance…
 Naruto.
 Wh-What is it?
 I am the leader of this team.
 While we are on this mission,you will obey the orders of your leader.
 Kiba, I can’t believe you’re ableto work with that kind of guy…
 Well, I’ve gotten used to it…
 I’m sure you’ll bond with him too, Naruto.
 I wonder about that…
 Naruto and the othersleft a while ago.
 I see.
 Didn’t you want to go too?
 When it comes to searchingfor insects,
 Shino, who’s an insect handler,is number one…
 And then Hinata who has Byakugan…
 and Kiba and Akamaru who havesensitive noses are there too…
 So there’s really no role thatI could play!
 What I must do right now…
 is to become a Medical Ninjaas soon as I possibly can!
 What’s the matter, Shino?!
 The sun’s going down.We’re setting up camp.
 Got it.
 – Huh? 					– Okay.
 Huh? What…?!
 We’re gonna set upcamp already?!
 I’m not tired at all yet!Let’s go further!
 Naruto, the leader ofthis team is me.
 I-I understand!
 Okay then…let’s sleep.
 Huh…we’re gonna sleep already?!
 Many animals and plantsgo to sleep at sunset
 and awake at sunrise.
 In order to search for insects,
 we must understand the rhythmof living creatures with our own bodies…
 But…the sun’s just set…
 Naruto, I am the leader of this team…
 Okay, okay. I got it!
 There’s no wayI can sleep so early…
 Yeah, right…
 All that complaining and guesswho's the first one to fall asleep?
 I have to pee…
 Huh?
 Huh?
 What’s that?
 It’s a waterfall…
 Hey… Is somebody there?
 S-Say…
 Damn it…!
 S-Sorry. Did I scare you?
 Huh?
 There’s nobody there…
 Huh, Naruto…Did you catch a cold?
 Yeah…a little…
 After sleeping so muchyou’re still tired?
 Well, uh…
 When I woke up last night to pee,I saw something awesome…
 Did you catch a cold too, Hinata?
 No, I’m okay…
 And…what was that awesome thing?
 It was a beautiful womanin the middle of the waterfall!
 Huh?
 When that person moved her arms,the water would suddenly move too!
 It was awesome!
 And what happened then…
 When I tried to speak to her,she suddenly vanished.
 You must have been dreamingor something.
 It's starting to feel that way…
 You idiot!
 Your face is red, Hinata.
 You might have reallycaught a cold.
 Huh…really, I’m fine…
 This fruit is edible.This will be our meal today.
 Got it.
 We can save onour food supplies too.
 There’s one thingI need to warn you about.
 On rare occasions, this fruit growsto the size of a human being.
 However, those fruitsare damaged inside.
 Don’t tamper with themunder any circumstance.
 There’s nobody who wouldeat something that huge.
 N-Naruto…!
 He’s eating it…
 Naruto… We’re going on ahead…
 I’ll…I’ll be right behind you!
 Sorry to keep you waiting!
 Wait just a second!
 Hey…aren’t we there yet?
 Yes.
 We're here!
 What…?
 Wow!
 I’ve never seen anythinglike this before.
 This certainly isn’t a placewhere humans could inhabit.
 That’s right…That’s why it’s paradise for insects.
 D-Don’t tell me…
 Could it be that…over there…?
 You mean that’s wherethe Bikochu are?
 No problem.lt’s better than the Chunin Exam.
 Damn…The foothold crumbles easily…
 – Naruto… 					– What?
 As the leader, I’m warning you…
 At a time like this,what is it?!
 Don’t fall.
 I already know thatwithout your telling me!
 Naruto!
 No way…!
 That was close…
 Those were insects, huh…
 That’s why I warned you.
 When this mission is over,
 I’m definitely gonna kickthat guy’s butt!
 This is…the Bikochu forest.
 Let’s go.
 There’s no mistake.Those are Leaf Shinobi.
 The fact that those guys came toa place like this
 means their objective is…
 Yeah…it’s the same as ours…the Bikochu.
 We’re not gonna let themtake any Bikochu.
 The Bikochu, …belong to us, the Kamizuru Clan!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 Huh! If you’re talking aboutthe insect in this photograph,
 I’m very familiar with it.
 – Huh? 					– Really?!
 Damn…Don’t tell methat was a Bikochu?
 Where did you see it?
 I heard some rustling in the kitchenin the middle of the night,
 and I unintentionally threwa slipper at it…
 Wait a second…
 N-Naruto…
 What you’re talking aboutis an ordinary cockroach.

 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

 Funeral March for the Living
 Wh-Why…
 Why does sucha good man have to…die?!
 It’s sad… 					lt’s so sad!
 I remember now…
 I forgot when,but you showed it to me, didn’t you?
 With a twinkle in your eye,
 you proudly said it wasa memento of your father.
 That was the pipe box, wasn’t it?lt was an amazing box.
 No wonder you’re so proud of it…
 Even though I took it and smashed it,you only laughed.
 You were smiling whenwe kicked you and tossed you.
 It was a great smile.
 Really…
 Hold it in, Rokusuke!They’ll all be gone.
 If we let this moment go,
 there will be no other chanceto get out of the village.
 But Kanpachi is…!
 It’s for the village,
 we have to do something andmake our way to that village!
 Yeah…
 Funerals are awesome, aren’t they!
 I wanna do that again.
 One…two…three people…got away again…
 Looks like we can haveanother funeral.
 This is…
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 You are…?
 Naruto Uzumaki! Right now,I’m in the middle of training.
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 H-Hey! I said hey!
 Hang in there!
 This is training too…!
 I can’t give up yet! Not yet!
 The escort for the ruler ofthe Land of Swamps, Lord Chichiyasu,
 was completed without incident!
 Well done.
 That’s Lady Tsunade’s…!
 Excellent dumplings are alwaysfrom the Leaf Village, aren’t they?
 That was my last one!
 Mission Accomplished!
 I came to pound the piratesof the Gottani Channel
 with the fist of love!
 If they take this opportunityto rehabilitate themselves,
 it’s worth while to shed a tear!
 I’ll have your team do it for me.
 Yes?
 Even though we’re already busy,that Naruto brought in more work.
 After this, Guy has the S-rank mission.
 The client picked him,so he must depart today.
 So, do it without Guy.
 That’s pretty straightforward…
 I called Neji Hyuga,Tenten and Lee.
 Ohh!
 My pupils can undertake the fulfillmentof this mission without incident!
 Wait…
 Take Naruto Uzumaki, too.
 Why can't it just be my pupils,who are loved by all the world?
 Please answer me, Lady Tsunade!
 It just is.
 Hidden Leaf Hospital
 Those three people that Naruto savedcame all the way
 from the Katabami Gold Mineto request a mission.
 Katabami Gold Mine is one ofthe Land of Rivers’ greatest mines,
 but about half a year ago, hooliganscalling themselves the Kurosuki family
 appeared on the pretext of guarding it,and took control of the village…
 killing villagers forno particular reason.
 How vile!
 Your mission is this:
 Once those three haveregained their strength,
 escort them to Katabami Gold Mineand eliminate the Kurosuki family.
 It’s a simple mission.
 Well anyway, it must be a groupof punks who’re after money.
 Why did you call me forsuch an easy mission?
 Who do you think you are?
 I’m busy searching forSasuke and training, and--!
 You forced your way into missionsthat you weren’t called for.
 It’s not a Genin’s placeto choose his missions!
 Would you like to be sent backto the Academy? Well?!
 Neji Hyuga!
 Yes!
 You’re the leader!
 It will be good training for youto try to tame the unstable.
 I don’t want to…but, I’ll do it!
 I’ll go continue my training!
 Hey Naruto!
 Please excuse them.They have no manners…
 Wait!
 Those little brats…!
 What the heck dothey think missions are?!
 Umm, excuse me?
 What?!
 The Kurosuki Family…
 What did you saytheir boss’ name was?
 Raiga!
 That’s what I thought…
 What?
 Well, on a previous mission,I heard a rumor about him.
 A rumor…?
 Pervy Sage hasn’t returned…I’m forced to go on a mission…
 Oh, this is irritating…
 Sakura!
 Naruto?
 What’s going on? A bird?
 Yesterday I found it injuredand treated it, but…
 Sakura, that’s amazing!
 But poor thing.
 It’s separated from its friends.
 Naruto!
 Oh, sorry, did I intrude?
 You intruded big time!
 No, no!
 Don’t turn your back,no need to grovel to youth.
 Sakura, Hello!
 Hello!
 What did you come here for?
 – Just to have a word.– Huh? What the--?!
 Oh, Sakura, goodbye!
 – Hey! What was that?!– She went wild, didn't she?
 She should act her age.
 Ichiraku		What?! The boss of		the Kurosuki family
 is one of the Seven Ninja SwordsMen of the Mist?
 Yeah, it’s exclusive informationfrom our respected teacher, Guy.
 Who’re the Seven Ninja SwordsMen of the Mist?
 Naruto, you said that
 you fought in the Land ofthe Waves mission, didn’t you?
 At that time…
 Oh, Zabuza! And?
 And Guy Sensei and Kakashi Senseifought Kisame Hoshigaki.
 I heard thatyou met them there too, Naruto.
 Oh! I know that guy!
 Those two were once called
 the Seven Ninja SwordsMen of the Mist.
 And at that time,who was with Kisame Hoshigaki?
 Oh!
 The man called Itachi!And then?
 You still don’t understand?
 If Raiga is one of the Seven Ninja SwordsMen of the Mist,
 then he’s probably tied to Itachiwho was with Kisame.
 Oh! And?
 Tell me, who's after Itachi?
 I know! Sasuke!
 That’s right!
 We can probably getthe clue to Sasuke’s whereabouts
 at Katabami Gold Mine!
 But…
 If that’s what Guy Sensei said then…
 Don’t say anything rude!
 It's information that's100% reliable!
 Starting now,while guarding Rokusuke and the others,
 we head toward Katabami Gold Mine
 to fulfill our mission towipe out the Kurosuki family.
 There’s a shop I’m familiarwith close to the gold mine.
 Let’s make that the base.
 What do you meana shop you’re familiar with?
 That’s the fun part of the trip.
 That aside, that Naruto is late…
 If the source of the informationis Guy Sensei,
 maybe he couldn’t quite trust it?
 That’s not true!Naruto will definitely come!
 That’s because Guy Sensei’sinformation is correct!
 Whatever.
 Here I am!
 We’re all here so…!
 Is that for you to say?!
 Let’s go!
 So…which way?
 Don’t be so anxious, Rokusuke,
 Those guys will save our town.
 It’s post-meal training!
 I won’t lose!
 I won’t lose!
 How long do you intendto rest here?!
 If we hurry, we can save Kanpachifrom the burial…
 Give it up…
 How long do you thinkit’s been since that happened?
 It’s painful but…
 I remember…this sleepiness.The shop is close by.
 You say you’re sleepy,and are you walking in your sleep?!
 It’s okay.
 I slept while on a marathon onthis road for three days straight.
 You are joking, right?
 It’s true.
 The track meet of my youthwith Guy Sensei.
 My body still remembers it.
 I’ve gotten sleepy.
 Hey, Bushy Brow,are you really okay?
 That’s right. In this area,there’s the scent of spicy curry.
 Curry? Now that you mention it…
 That’s right!
 Over there, it’s…the Curry of Life Shop!
 Grandma Sansho!
 Oh my… 					Oh goodness!
 I haven’t seen you for a while!
 – Oh my my my!– You're looking well!
 This is the shop Lee is familiar with?
 That mountain isthe Katabami Gold Mine
 Grandma Sansho’s curry saved my life.
 So you’re sayingit’s delicious curry?
 No, it really saved my life.I’m indebted to this curry.
 It was whenI’d just become a Genin …
 When Guy Sensei gave mea special training routine.
 Oh my, that’s right.I remember.
 Do your best!
 Oh my…
 Hey Grandma Sansho!
 Oh my, they’ve come again!
 Those people are running in their sleep.
 Karashi! Karashi!
 If you had that kind of energy,you wouldn’t lose to the bullies.
 Oh my,I might have said too much.
 Curry of Life Shop
 Oh my! It’s the third day.
 They’ve been running the whole time.
 Oh my. What a problem.
 I wonder if he’s hungry…?
 What a pickle! He's not waking up!
 Maybe I didn't useenough spice?
 Karashi…
 I’ve never seen a personwho works this hard.
 Oh really… so you want to helpthis young man too…?
 This is the curry of life.
 Now! Grandma Sansho went tothe trouble of making this curry.
 Let’s eat!
 I’m digging in!
 Yum!This is yummy-yum delicious!
 Delicious! The use of spicesis wonderful!
 And this ricegoes perfectly with the curry!
 Delicious!
 By the way, I don’t see Karashi.
 Karashi saw how hard you worked
 and became a bright kidfull of energy, but…
 He got too much energyand left for town.
 What?
 I was wrong to keep telling himto be stronger.
 “I’m going to be a man!
 “I’m going to be part ofthe Kurosuki family,” he said.
 Oh my! I’m not blaming you.Don’t worry.
 It's too late.
 I’m responsible…
 Oh my.
 Neji!
 Please include Karashi’s rescueinto our mission!
 We’ll bring him back fromthe road of evil!
 It’s fine.
 We’ll use this shop as a baseand take a good look into the village.
 Then we’ll come up with a strategyand spring into action.
 Yes!
 You guys await orders here.
 Because it’s dangerousif the Kurosuki family finds us.
 It’s a disaster!
 Rokusuke! Rokusuke!He's gone!
 I’m sure he went to town alone!
 That’s not good!
 If those guys find Rokusuke…!
 Now that it’s come to this,
 we don’t have timeto come up with a strategy!
 Let’s get right to it!
 No!
 We’ll get right to it!
 Let's hurry.
 Wait for me, Kanpachi,I’m coming now…
 Someone… is coming…
 Aw, again…I have to put on a funeral!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too

 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 You taught me that day.
 If you cook with great care,
 you can save someone’s lifewith just one serving of curry.
 Even for a person like me,
 with intense effort,it’s not an impossibility…
 That’s what I thought.
 You were far more admirableback then, Karashi.
 But…

 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left

 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 Heh! It’s over…
 Losing is not an Option
 What?!
 Just barely…
 That was a close one.
 But…I was able to throw it offjust a little.
 There’s no mistake.
 He’s now realized the secretof the Byakugan.
 What’s the meaning of this?How?!
 How was he able to throw it
 a whole six inchesfrom his vital point?!
 I see… That Chakra!
 He was emitting Chakrathe whole time
 and covered the area surrounding him!
 And in a wide range to that extent.
 No wonder he was ableto detect the arrow and
 throw off the trajectory of it.
 But constantly emitting thatmuch Chakra is a death throe…
 If he doesn’t go that far,he can’t dodge.
 In other words, there’s no mistake.
 It’s as I hypothesized…
 The arrow earlier wastotally invisible to him!
 He doesn’t carry out useless attacks…
 And from the results,he accurately examines the information.
 And…he’s also discoveredthe weakness of my eyes…
 Impressive.
 Of all the enemiesI’ve fought until now,
 this guy’s the strongest!
 He has 360-degree sight.
 And he unfailingly detects attacks
 that penetrate the roughly150-feeot circumference around him.
 But for some reason,
 there were Kunai Kniveshe couldn’t evade completely.
 Why couldn’t he evade them?
 Because he couldn’t see them!
 In other words, even his Visual Jutsuhas a slight blind spot!
 Being unable to see Kunai Knivesentering that blind spot,
 he’s unable to react.
 So he was dealing with attacksfrom the blind spot
 with that defense technique.
 And I analyzed all the attacksI carried out
 and grasped them perfectly.
 Right behind his first thoracic vertebra…
 there exists a blind spot expandingfrom a very small point.
 Indeed, if he moves anddoesn’t stabilize the blind spot,
 it becomes difficult to aim therewith an arrow.
 But such a trick…doesn’t fool me!
 Gentle Fist is pointless ifyou don’t come close to your enemy.
 And you can’t afford to think aboutapproaching me at this point.
 It’s about how to escape now…
 Though whether you struggle or not,you’re going to die anyway.
 Heh… It seems you onlyhave a little Chakra left.
 The fate of the small fry characterin an easy game
 is to be destroyed right away!
 It’s useless!
 A thread?!
 I see, with this thread…
 This time, the trajectory was thrown offslightly by the trees, huh?
 If that’s the case…
 I’ll add some rotation this time.
 So even if it hits a tree,
 it’ll just cut through and the trajectorywon’t be thrown off.
 And as before…
 I’ll control the arrow up until150 feet away from him
 using a thread with Chakraflowing through.
 I’ll take aim at the moving target…
 and plunge the arrow intothe blind spot with a pinpoint attack!
 He’s still standing up?
 He’s strong…He’s much stronger than me.
 I hardly have any Chakra left now.
 I probably won’t be able to evadehis next attack completely.
 Is this it?
 I’ll win no matter what!
 Naruto… I wonder what you’d do.
 I’ve had enough.
 I can’t dodge it anyway.
 He’s stopped moving…Has he given up?
 But just to make doubly sure…
 Maximum destructive powerwith 120% accuracy.
 I’ve got him!
 This is it.
 Gentle Fist!
 Wh-What? He still…?!
 No! My attack just nowshould’ve made the kill.
 Substance with Chakra base…
 It’s meaningless against Gentle Fist.
 Gentle Fist…
 I see, in his final moments,
 he funneled the last Chakrathrough the thread!
 Eight crows…
 Again I couldn’t see one of them.
 What happened to him?
 He damaged several ofmy internal organs.
 But…I can still move.
 You failure…
 I told you… I don’t know when to quit!
 Why do you try to go againstyour destiny that much?
 Because I was called…a failure!
 But if you’re going to say it’s futile,you don’t have to do anything!
 After I become the Hokage,I’ll change Hyuga!
 The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh?
 I was careless…
 Clone Jutsu was the NinjutsuI stunk at.
 Don’t be whining about boring stufflike destiny and what not,
 and how it can’t be changed!
 Unlike me,
 you're not a failure.
 Naruto…
 Now it’s become the three of us…
 Don’t worry about such things.
 Both Choji and Neji willcatch up right away.
 Choji had the trump card.
 And I’ve fought Nejiin the Chunin exam, so I know…
 Know what?
 That he’s…a true genius. Believe it!
 I cannot lose…
 Whether he’s an enemymuch stronger than me…
 or even if this body should fail me…
 I cannot lose!
 I have a reason why I cannot lose!
 I’ve had a hard time of it this time.
 I played too long…
 Huh?
 I can’t build up Chakra…
 How? You should’vebeen instantly killed!
 How come you’re alive?!
 I couldn’t completelyevade it anyway.
 So I was prepared to deliberatelytake the hit.
 And I knew of my own weaknessmuch more than you do…
 There were eight crows, huh?
 This Byakugan has a blind spot.
 However, if I knew that your attackwould only come from there…
 I could release my Chakra justto that blind spot and detect the attack.
 It’s not so difficult to make
 a move of just a few inchesto throw off the aim.
 I’d suffer a serious injury,but instant death can be avoided.
 So you took the hit deliberately…?
 It doesn’t change the factthat you’re going to die here.
 How can you go that far?!
 “Of all the enemies,”you’re the strongest I’ve ever fought…
 But, there’s a reason why I cannot lose.
 Of all those I’ve ever fought,the strongest one said this to me…
 – Unlike me…you are not a failure!– Unlike me…you are not a failure!
 He said that.
 I’ve been called a genius all along.
 So I cannot lose.
 And for the sake of those guyswho believe
 that this humdrum and small meis a genius!
 “The fate of the small fry characterin a game is to be destroyed right away.”
 You said that, didn’t you?
 Look at this situation!
 Things like fate,isn’t determined by someone!
 I wonder…
 You also look likeyou’re going to die!
 Neji, live.
 More than anyone in the clan,
 you’re the man loved mostby the Hyuga ability…
 I cannot die so easily.
 Even if you act tough,you can’t stem the current now…
 Master Sasuke ran tothe Sound Village by his own wish.
 Sasuke is now in the darkness…
 No…
 Naruto… You’ve got better eyes than me.
 There’s a person who can find himin the darkness and save him.
 Master Sasuke belongsto Lord Orochimaru.
 No matter who it may be,they can’t save…
 He can save him!
 Because…Naruto…you…
 You saved me from the darkness!
 Talking rubbish until the end…
 But…

 Damn it…
 Everyone…
 I'll leave the rest…
 to you.
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak

 Yahoo! The enemies are quite close!
 All right! We’ll catch up in a burst!
 Speaking in terms of number,we’ve got more!
 If things go well,we can get him back next!
 Yeah! I don’t feel like losingwith four against two!
 Four against two?
 That’s twice the opponents’ number!
 Say-say. Were there four of us?
 Are you an idiot?!Me, Akamaru, Shikamaru, and you!
 No matter how you count,there are four!

 We are beingcompletely  underestimated.

 No, he’s already here.
 Aw, c’mon, what took you so long?
 Sorry.
 It took time to eat the scums’ Chakra.
 Hey fatso, don’t you dare drag!
 Hurry up and carry that coffin…
 That’s your job, you vulgar swine.
 I know.
 What, Jirobo…You’re awfully easygoing today.
 What do you mean?
 I’m just saying I’m not handing youthe coffin.
 Because you’re not Jirobo!
 This time let me do it.

 It’s too soon for you to thinkyou captured us with a thing like this!
 Shut up!
 C’mon, what the hell isthat fatso doing, dammit!
 It was a mistake to leavebehind the weakest of us, after all.

 Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji…
 Even though we’ve followed the plan,it’s no good.
 I’m going to cocoon you.
 Damn!
 Damn it! Damn it!
 What’s with this thread?! It won’t cut.
 It’s useless.
 My thread is so strong thateven if two elephants pulled away,
 it wouldn’t break.
 Shadow Clone… Interesting.
 The thread is sticking…
 This stickiness is probably made
 by mixing Chakra withhis special body fluid.
 Moreover, this strength. Even afterit’s been released from his hands…
 Chakra’s continuously flowingin the thread.
 It’s impossible…The level of the Jutsu is unrealistic.
 Calm down… Just calm down…

 It’s a different color thanthe thread from before.
 What’s he gonna do?
 It’s quickly solidifying, huh…
 You are the first one,so it’s like a little entertainment.
 Now I’ll play a game to seewhich of you is the real one.
 What did you say?!
 First is…you at the end.
 Naruto!
 It was a clone, huh.Well, this one next!
 What a lucky guy.
 Next, I’ll do two at a time.The odds are 2 to 1.
 This guy has a great luck,but it's either one or the other now!
 Turns out he made it to the last.
 Well, it was fun as a game,but now the game’s over.
 Die!
 The first one is done.
 What?!
 I see, the real body madeits shadow clones get caught,
 and hid himself andwaited for a chance, huh.
 For a small fish like that to makesuch a plan in those circumstances...
 You're not too bad…but …
 You’re at the end of the line. Die!
 What?!
 Naruto, your stall was helpful.
 Neji!
 You… How…?!
 Substance with Chakra base…
 It’s meaningless in frontof Gentle Fist
 that destroys by pouringChakra through.
 That guy’s Jutsu…
 Evidently I’m the only onewho can fight it.
 Go!
 I’ll take care of this.
 What’s wrong? Hey, Akamaru.
 Apparently, this guy’s strongerthan the fatso before.
 Quite a bit stronger.
 If we’re not prepared for“one person, one kill,”
 then it’s not going to work out.
 That’s what you said earlier.
 Yeah, that’s right.
 Plus, we won’t be able to catch upwith Sasuke if we stall here.
 Choji hasn’t come back either.
 The reason we’re doing this
 is because of the missionto bring back Sasuke.
 But that’s not all.
 What we are after and tryingto protect is the bond
 of the Shinobi ofthe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Do you remember Iruka’s wordsat the Third Hokage’s funeral?
 Iruka Sensei, why do people risktheir lives for others?
 When someone dies,
 they depart with their past,present and future.
 Many people die on missionsor at war.
 And their death is surprisinglyunceremonious…they simply die.
 Hayate was one of those people.
 Those who die have dreamsand goals, too…
 But everyone has things thatare equally important.
 Parents, siblings, friends, lovers,the people of their village,
 the people important to you.
 The connection to the peopleyou trust and help mutually,
 the people important to youfrom the day you were born.
 And the thread thatconnects you and your people
 gets stronger through time.
 It’s not a theory.
 That’s what a person doesas the thread is established
 because they’re important to you…
 Look, Sasuke is headingtowards Orochimaru.
 We can’t let Orochimaru geta hold of someone from our village.
 Absolutely not.
 And…
 Naruto…
 Your eyes are better than mine.
 Right now, Sasuke is…
 in the darkness.
 Hurry up and go!I’ll catch up with you all!
 Gotcha!
 Okay! Let’s go!
 You along with Choji,be sure to catch up!
 Yeah…
 Neji, be absolutely sure to catch up!
 Heh…think I’ll let them get away?!
 Byakugan!
 Here it comes!
 This guy’s pretty good…
 Neji!
 That’s Neji all right!
 Not yet…I won’t let you escape that easily!
 I won’t let you go any further from here!
 It’s useless.
 Well, that’s fine.
 It seems you’re the strongestout of the lot.
 Aw man, now I wanna play…
 It’s such a waste ifa game isn't played little by little.
 For starters,I’ll play and kill you in three minutes.
 I got you.
 You’re pretty good at handling Chakraand you’ve got sharp eyes.
 You release Chakra fromthe Chakra points in your hands
 like a sharp needle.
 You see the thin part of the threadwith Chakra running through it, and attack.
 I see, I’ve heard from Lord Orochimaru…
 This is what’s called Gentle Fist, isn’t it?
 But if you can’t usethose annoying hands,
 they can’t cut my threads either.
 Man, games. The instant you knowthe rules of engagement,
 they’re no longer interesting.
 It’s only been a minute,but I’m already tired of you.
 Die!
 Ninja Art:Gum Style Spider Thread
 What?!
 How did he…?!
 I’ll explain, specially to you.
 It’s not just my hands
 I can release Chakra fromall of the Chakra points on my body.
 And it’s game over.
 Gentle Fist: 8 trigrams 64 palms.
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a personbroken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around (round around)
 Shake shake shakeLet’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 The attack on his Chakra pointsis ineffective.
 On top of that,
 he switched to a long-distance attackto avoid Gentle Fist.
 This guy blocks my every moveand he quickly reads my hands.
 This is bad. I’m at a disadvantageif the fight drags on.
 And if he noticed that, then…

 Insignificant…
 friends?
 Those who hold silly sentimentsabout fighting

 I'm sick of listening to you talk!
 I'll clobber you for sure!
 You guys misunderstand real strength!
 Shut up!
 W-Why…? Why is it?!
 Why Yashamaru…?
 Why did you, why…?
 Why…?
 Love is…
 a heart that desires to servea precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person.
 Just like my older sister did.
 You are a precious personwho is close to me, Gaara!
 Always…only Yashamaru would always…
 Me…always me…
 It was an order.
 I was commissioned to kill you…
 By your father…
 Lord Kazekage.
 My father…?
 Why did my father…?
 Why…? Why me?
 Gaara, you who were born and possessedby the Sand Spirit Shukaku…
 have been watched overas an experiment.
 However, Gaara, you couldn’tcontrol the living spirit Shukaku,
 the Sand Spirit which possessesthe power of the sand.
 Eventually your existence wouldbecome too dangerous for the village.
 Before that occurred…
 So Yashamaru, you had not choice…
 but to comply with my father’s order…?
 No… That is not correct.
 It is true I acceptedLord Kazekage’s order.
 But if I had wanted to turn it down,I could have turned it down.
 Gaara…
 Deep down in my heart,I probably…
 hated you.
 You, whose birth took the lifeof my beloved older sister.
 The child she left behind in death…
 Thinking that you were her remembrance,I tried desperately to love you.
 However… I was not able to.
 My sister didn’t choose to have you.
 My sister became a sacrificefor the village,
 and she died whilecursing this village!
 From that time, I probably…
 have been burdened with a woundof the heart that could never heal.
 Unlike a wound on the body,there is no ointment and sometimes,
 it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life.
 A wound of the heart?
 Your name…is the name my sister gave you.
 ""This child’s name is Gaara…
 ""A devil that loves only itself…
 ""Love only yourself…
 ""And fight only foryour own sake.
 ""If you do that,you will continue to exist.""
 Such was the hope it contained.
 However…
 my sister did not give you this name
 because she was concernedabout you or loved you.
 The reason she gave you this name,a name so you would continue to exist…
 …was so that the deep-seated hatredof my sister
 who died hating and cursingthis village…
 would remain…
 and be known to all!
 You were never…loved!
 This is the last…
 Please die…
 I believe that my sister loved you, Gaara.
 Love?
 The sand automatically trying toprotect you is like the love of a mother.
 I believe that sand is filledwith your mother’s will.
 Love.
 Love only yourself.
 And fight only for your own sake.
 So that is Gaara…That is me.
 I finally understand.
 I am alone.
 I will no longer believe in anyone…or love anyone.
 I am alone!
 Yes, I am all by myself.
 What’s the matter?Hurry up and come at me!
 Don't you care what happensto your so-called precious friends?!
 Sakura!
 Dang it!
 Naruto’s not his usual self…
 Did something happen between them?
 In any case…
 In any case,I need to save Sakura!
 But… what to do?!
 That’s it!
 Since it's come to this…Though it's gonna use up a lot of Chakra…
 There’s no choicebut to summon the Chief Gamabunta!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What’s this?! You’re a little kid!
 If you want something from me,give me some snack!
 If you don’t, I won’t play with you!
 You know something?I hate you frogs!
 What did you say?!Don’t make fun of amphibians! Really!
 Jeez, I don’t have time toplay with you, little squirt!
 Darn! Why is it…?
 I practiced for so long, but with this,there’s no other way…
 I need to save everyone!
 Everyone…you say?
 Don’t make me laugh.
 I fight…only for myself!

 If you don’t take me down,the sand over this girl won’t fall away!

 but at this rate, I’ll also be…!

 But what is that guy?
 You’re persistent…Sarutobi Sensei!
 I-It doesn’t move?!
 Y-You hard-to-kill fools!
 Do you still not understand, Orochimaru?
 The Leaf Village is my home!
 I told you I am the pillarof that house!
 That’s why I’m sayingI will break that pillar!
 As long as the people of the village
 fiercely fight to protecttheir dear comrades,
 the pillar of the Leaf Village will notbe broken by the likes of you!
 I wonder about that.
 Do not underestimate the Hokage!
 I-Impossible…!
 Where is…?Most of your Chakra should be gone!
 Chakra and Ninjutsu arenot all there is to strength!
 W-What lonely eyes…
 Such lonely eyes…
 This guy is also turning into a monster…the same as me.
 I hated every last one of them.
 I didn’t understand who I was,
 why I was so hated,why I even existed.
 In other words,
 you’re the Nine-Tailed Fox who killedlruka’s parents and ruined the village!
 You’ve been deceived by everyonein the village all along!
 I…
 When I learned that theNine-Tailed Fox was inside me,
 everyone in the village seemedeven more cold-hearted…
 I was so deeply troubled…
 But…
 Naruto! Let’s go haveramen for a change!
 Yay! I will, I will!
 I’ll have the one withextra BBQ pork slices!
 Huh! You loser…lf you want to beat me train harder!
 Shut up! I won’t lose to you!
 Hey Naruto!What did Sasuke say about me?
 He didn’t say anything…
 By the way! By the way!Wouldn't you rather know how I feel…?
 Oh! Really, Sakura!
 I’m gonna eat now!
 Um… Naruto, you’ll really die if you eatonly noodles and sweet red bean porridge.
 You’re a Ninja,so eat more vegetables!
 Here, have some!
 What?! I don’t like vegetables!
 People appeared who acknowledged me…
 That’s why I became all right,
 even though there wasthe demon fox inside my body,
 or even if the people of the villagelooked at me with cold eyes.
 Because…I wasn’t alone anymore!
 I never imagined how happy andfortunate I could feel.
 How really…really…
 great it was.
 How truly great it wasto be here.
 I was relieved to knowI am allowed to be here, to exist!
 That’s why it scares meto think about the past…
 That suffering is agonizing…
 It’s a pitch-black hell!
 If…I had remained that way, all alone…
 That’s precisely why I understand!
 So what did I have in this life,why did I keep living?
 This is the answer I came to…
 I am living in order to killhuman beings other than myself.
 I don’t know what happened, but…
 This guy’s always beensuffering all alone…
 Even now, without ever feeling relief…
 Only able to believe in himself…
 Even now, he’s battling in hell…
 That’s how it is…
 To him, someone like mewho's acknowledged by others…
 might seem like a weakling ina world of happiness without tension…
 Can I really win againsta guy like this?
 What’s the matter?!Are you afraid of me?
 To fight for the sake of oneself?To fight for the sake of others?
 You should just love yourself,and fight for yourself!
 That is the definition ofthe strongest one!
 Now fight me!
 What happened tothe boldness you had earlier?!
 Show me your strength!I’ll throw that strength to the ground!
 Now what’s the matter?!lf you don’t fight me, I’ll kill that girl!

 This is Sasuke’s…
 I didn’t make it in time…please forgive me.
 Naruto…
 I know the kind of person you are…
 You must have madea desperate effort.
 Sasuke…
 That’s my boy…
 With me, you’re allyour father talks about…
 You are my one and only brother.
 I will continue to be for you…
 a wall that you must finda way to cross over.
 Even if you were to hate me…
 You are someone
 who can obtain Mangekyo Sharinganjust like me…
 However, on one condition.
 Your closest friend…
 The Final Valley…
 To think that Sasuke and Narutowould battle it out here…
 How ironic…
 Yeah…
 When I look atthe flow of this water,
 it’s as if I’m being confrontedby an eternal, never-ending battle…
 Just like the fate of the two peopledepicted in these statues here
 who founded the Village Hiddenin the Leaves…
 Naruto and Sasuke,as long as you both live…
 You have to kill…
 your closest friend!
 I'm not gonna…
 abide by everything you say!
 I will get my hands on powerdoing it my own way!
 I will surpass youdoing it my own way!
 Without fail!
 The rain’s…let up, hasn’t it?
 Yeah.
 With that much rain,
 I won’t be able to pursuethe scent anymore.
 Naruto is more important nowthan pursuing Sasuke.
 Yeah.
 It’s gotten interesting, hasn’t it?
 Yeah…
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 I’m sorry.I’m really sorry, Sakura.
 I made a once-in-a-lifetime promisethat I would bring Sasuke back.
 But, I’m not finished yet!
 I’ll fulfill my promise,no matter what!
 Since that was whatI was always saying…
 that I won’t go back on my word.
 That’s my Way of Ninja!

 I never thought he’d attempt to usethe Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu.
 But it’s still just this level…
 It’s completely differentfrom the original one.
 That Tsunade…lncredibly strong as always.
 I remember a long time ago,
 getting punched by her andknocked back nearly 100 meters…
 At any rate, Naruto’s hopeless.
 Are you okay?
 Jiraiya, was it you…
 who taught him that Rasengan,the Spiral Chakura Sphere?
 Rasengan…?!
 I’m his teacher, after all.
 Humph…You and the Fourth Hokage arethe only ones who can use that Jutsu.
 Are you in your right mind…
 showing someone Jutsuthat he can’t master?
 Don’t give him false hope.
 That’s why the moony kid starts jokingabout becoming a Hokage!
 It’s no joke! Stupid! Stupid!
 If I have three days,I’ll master this Jutsu!
 You said it, kid.
 Men don’t go back on their word!
 Hah! I stand by my words.
 That’s my Ninja Way.
 Then…how about a wager?
 A wager…?
 I’ll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 I’ll acknowledge that you havewhat it takes to become the Hokage
 and give you this necklace.
 Lady Tsunade! That’s the precious--!
 I don’t need such a sorry necklace!
 Don’t say such things, Naruto…
 That’s the only one of its kind in this world.
 And you could buy three mountainsif you were to sell it.
 It belonged to the First Hokage.
 A-Awesome…
 Well, that’ll be fine!
 He’ll do anything for money…?
 Good…
 However, you lose if you can’t masterthe Jutsu in one week!
 And you’ll give me all the moneyyou have on you.
 Oh! Gama-chan!
 When did she…?!
 Lady Tsunade! Why?
 That necklace is…
 He won’t be able to do it, anyway…
 Let’s go, Shizune.
 She never once usedthat necklace for a bet…
 You don’t have to answer right now.
 However, I want it in a week.
 Inheritance!The Necklace of Death!
 Huh? Who is it this late at night?
 Okay, okay. I’m coming.
 I’m sorry to bother you so late, Naruto.I need to talk to you…
 As for me, I’m going to geta good night’s rest and train tomorrow!
 I’m sorry. But I didn’t want youto misunderstand Lady Tsunade…
 As well as the necklace…
 Humph! I could care lessabout an old lady like that!
 Lady Tsunade is not the typeof person you think she is!
 Don't speak of her like thatwhen you don't even know her!
 I-I’m sorry…for raising my voice.
 She didn’t used to be like that.
 She was a kind personwho loved the village.
 But, she changed…
 After that day…
 That day?
 What’s that day?
 The day she lost her dreams,her love, her hopes… Everything.
 All that was left wasthat necklace of memories…
 It’s as precious as life to Lady Tsunade.
 It’s really not somethingto be offered in a bet.
 I don’t care about that!She bet it on her own, right?!
 Besides…that necklace is reallynot something for you to wear.
 It’s not just a necklace!
 It doesn’t acknowledge anyoneother than Lady Tsunade.
 If someone else wears it,that person inevitably…
 …dies!
 Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday!
 I’m not a kid anymore,so I don’t need gifts on my birthday!
 What’re you saying?You’re still a kid, aren’t you?!
 But never mind that.Hurry up and open your present!
 You’ll definitely be pleased!
 Big Sister, could this be…?
 Yes… It’s the First Hokage’s,our grandfather’s necklace!
 I love you, Big Sister!
 I thought it’d be better than me having it.
 You’ve been wanting it all along, right?Take good care of it.
 Not just this necklace!
 This village is grandfather’s treasure!I’m going to protect it!
 Nawaki…
 I’m the grandson of the Hokage whobuilt the Village Hidden in Leaves, so…!
 You said it.Men don’t go back on their word!
 Right!
 Someday, I’ll become just like Grandfather.And the Hokage name will be mine!
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 Take off your headband, Nawaki.
 Just hurry up and take it off.I have another present for you.
 It’s a charm to makeyour dream come true.
 It’s best if you don’t lookat the remains.
 There’s nothing wrong with that,is there?
 Even if she were to look,
 she wouldn’t be able to determinethat it’s her little brother.
 Enough, Orochimaru!
 We are at war, now.All Shinobi end up like this.
 There are no doctors onthe battlefield, so…
 However, children really getmuch too excited, don’t they?
 Especially on the day afterthey receive a present.
 Not just this necklace…
 This village is grandfather’s treasure!I’m going to protect it!
 First, in a mission wherea Four-Man Cell must act alone
 for a long period of timein enemy territory,
 by deploying one of the fourto be a medical specialist,
 the survival rate as well asthe mission success rate
 should go up significantly.
 Therefore, establishing a framework
 to foster Ninja possessingadvanced medical skills
 and the development ofa medical institution
 should be consideredan urgent task for the present!
 Yes indeed, it’s as you say.
 But we’re in the middle of a war now.
 It takes too much time toestablish a medical framework.
 And at present,we don't have enough knowledge…
 Enemies don’t wait.
 What did you say?! Hey, old man!
 Then we’ll never…
 I agree with her.
 I don’t want the lives of the Shinobiwho died to be for naught.
 There should be somethingwe can learn from that.
 Excuse me!
 Thanks for earlier.
 What you said was right.
 Umm…
 It’s late.Shall I walk you home?
 What? Is that okay with you?Where’s your home?
 The other way.
 Then don’t bother.
 I don’t mind.I also want to talk with you.
 And I would always use this pathto the Academy to pick up my little sister.
 I loved this path.
 What? You loved?
 Yeah. In the battle when the Leafwas attacked at night one year ago,
 my little sister was…
 This man…is the same as me.
 Tomorrow’s mission will bewithin enemy lines…
 Fighting and losing cherished peopleis not the only way for a Shinobi.
 Uh-huh.
 I’m living in a world of Shinobiwhere death always hovers.
 I want to risk my life to bringthis war-torn world under control.
 I love this village and my comrades.
 So I want to protect them.
 Since my little sister died,that sole thought has sustained me.
 So I’ll become the Hokage…
 An existence that protects everyone…
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
 Dan…
 I’d like you…to take this.
 Hang on, Dan!
 Tsunade… I don’t want…to die yet.
 I have many things that I must…do.
 Don’t talk, Dan!
 His kidney has been blown out…
 It’s futile even for Tsunadewho is known as one of the Sannin…
 I…must not…die here.
 It’ll be okay. I stopped the bleeding.
 So it’ll be okay… You’ll be saved, Dan!
 Really?
 Thank goodness…
 Dan! Hang on!
 Dan!
 Dang it! Don’t come out…
 Stop… Please stop!
 Stop… Stop…
 Stop… Stop…
 Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
 Stop, I say!
 That’s enough. He’s dead!
 You understand, don’t you, Naruto…?
 Ever since that day,
 Lady Tsunade has been…in a constant turmoil.
 Naruto…?
 I’m heading out…for training!
 Oh, you are already at it, I see!
 Hi, welcome!
 Why are you here?
 You’re cold. Don’t say that.
 Master Jiraiya…
 Shizune, could you leave us?
 It's been a while.I want to drink with her again.
 Master, sake! And some radish!
 Coming up!
 I’m counting on you, Master Jiraiya.
 Your radish is ready.
 Ooh. This looks good.
 At any rate, to think you’d still be takinggood care of that necklace…
 I thought you’d have lost itlong since to gambling.
 It’s a memento of those two, right?
 Is he on your mind…?
 Who?
 Naruto.
 Not particularly…
 Still, it’s immature,taking on that kid as an opponent…
 He shouldn’t be able to masterthat Jutsu in a week, right?
 That’s not what’s called a bet.
 What’s with the fit of despair?
 It’s not a fit of despair!
 Are you going to meetOrochimaru again?
 I can tell by looking at Shizune’s face.
 I don’t know what kind of dealhe proposed,
 but don’t rush to a decision.
 And…let me just tell you one thing.
 The successive line of Hokageshave protected
 the Leaf Village and those living in it.
 They brought troubled times under controland helped the village to prosper.
 They risked their livesfor this dream, this ideal!
 You're not someone who can't understandthe feelings of the previous Hokages.
 Just try doing somethingto betray the Leaf Village.
 When that happens, I’ll kill you myself!
 It has nothing to do with me now!
 A person who has experiencedthe death of people close to them
 and doesn’t feel anythingis just a butcher.
 You’re different, aren’t you?
 No one cared for the welfareof the villagers more than you.
 At that time, too…
 That’s enough with the lecture!
 Why…did you bring that kid?
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
 He resembles him, doesn’t he?
 His age is about the same, too…
 Not just that…
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 Geez, you do nothing,but reckless things.
 Do you want to die?
 You’re still a Genin,so on the battlefield just run away.
 Don’t tell a man to “run away”!
 That dream… And his cockiness as well…
 No good! Dang it! Dang it!Tomorrow, for sure…!
 My head hurts.
 I totally got sick from drinking,thanks to her…
 It seems Naruto never came homelast night…
 He's such a fool.
 Why don’t we make a deal?
 I’ll resurrect the little brotherand man, both of whom you loved…
 with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.
 Don’t you want to see those two,Tsunade?
 If I treat your arms…
 What do you intend to do with them?
 This time, I will completelydestroy Leaf Village!
 No! You must not believein their sweet talk…
 Their wishes…
 Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…And dreams… Did you forget them ?!
 I’ll be straight with you.
 Tsunade, the village has demandedthat you become the Fifth Hokage.
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 Darn it! What am I doing?!
 I fell asleep at suchan important time!
 Moreover, today is the dayof the bet!
 Meanwhile, I don't even know wherethat old lady Tsunade has gone to!
 My training is not completed yet…
 I've got to play it by earand rely on a one-shot deal!

 That Naruto…
 He keeps getting stronger…
 He did it…that kid.
 Yeah! He’s on the right track!
 And he’s a little cute…
 Something about it…
 I’m envious of you…
 Watching your battle makes me thinkthat I have to work really hard too…
 That’s amazing, you know?
 He won. Is it for real?
 I thought he was the same as me,in the not going anywhere class…
 Not going anywhere?
 Now people are squealing...
 Looks like he’s part of the groupthat’s going somewhere.
 Maybe I couldn’t beat him…
 This is really bad.lt kinda depresses me…
 To retain himself and draw outthe Chakras of the Nine-Tailed Fox…
 Yeah… Most of the Leaf Village peoplehere are surprised.
 That Naruto…
 When did he learn to control the strengthof Nine-Tailed Fox to that extent?
 Even a bird who gets caught,once it learns how,
 will open the lid of its basketwith its own beak.
 He won't give up, for he wants tofly freely in the sky again.
 This time you lost!
 Father…
 It’s okay, there’s no damageto his internal organs.
 It seems like his Chakrais almost used up.
 You are not the only one special.
 Why do you act againstyour fate that much?!
 Because I was called a failure…
 Those who become Hokageare born to that fate.
 So what?!
 Lord Hyuga!
 I’m sorry but…Could you step out for a moment?
 B-But…
 It won’t take long.
 Y-Yes.
 What do you need from me?
 That day…
 I came to tell you the truth…about that day.
 That day…?
 At that time, I intended to die!
 W-What are you talking about?!
 That day my father…
 He was killedas your body double!
 The truth of that day…is here.
 They're probably only excuses madeat the convenience of the head family.
 The person you are now…should be able to understand.
 This writing…!
 Neji… I only have a little time left.
 I want to use that limited timeto convey something to you…
 Convey something to me?
 The head of Ninjas from theLand of Lightning,
 who was trying to kidnap Miss Hinata,was killed by Lord Hiashi…
 But the Land of Lightning didn’tacknowledge the abduction of Miss Hinata,
 made only the killingof the head Ninja a problem,
 and made unreasonable demands.
 It can’t be helped.
 With my one life,the village can be saved…
 Wait, Hiashi. Don’t be so hasty!
 The Hyuga’s Kekkei Genkaiis an important strength of this land.
 It is the duty of the head familyto protect it forever…
 However, for the sake of that duty…
 if we involve our landin a desperate war…!
 I understand that!That’s why…
 Isn’t that whywe have branch families?
 Hizashi’s corpse…We’ll hand it over as your body double.
 Hizashi too…understands the situation.
 However, what they want isthe secret of the power of the Byakugan.
 The point in time thatHizashi becomes a corpse,
 that power will be sealed.
 I don’t believe that the Land of Lightningwill consent to that.
 That’s their true intent,
 but the condition made by Lightning is to“Hand over Hiashi Hyuga’s dead body.”
 We pretend that we agreedto their terms,
 and hand Hizashi,who is identical to you, over...
 and they can’t pursue itany further than that.
 B-But…
 Hiashi… The time has come…
 Your predecessors have done the sameto protect the power of Hyuga clan.
 Even siblings…have the heart to write each other off.
 That is the fate of the head family.
 And this…is the destiny ofones born into Hyuga!
 Where has Lord Hiashi,who is always bullish, go?
 The scale of this issue is differentfrom the ones in the past!
 It’s not that easy…
 H-Hizashi…you…
 Please…let me go.
 You… You…have Neji.
 Why do you choose death…for the head family?!
 That’s not so!
 I have been resentingthe head family.
 To tell the trutheven now I’m bitter.
 That’s why…
 I want to die protecting you as“my brother,” not as the head family.
 It’s the first time I’ve hadthe freedom to choose.
 I’ve only shown Neji my ugly side.
 However, now I’ve come hereand finally know my own intentions.
 So please tell Neji…
 I-I wasn’t killed to protectthe head family…
 but to protect my siblings,family and the land…
 by my own will I chose death!
 T-To choose death…you call that freedom…?
 Big brother…
 Once, just this once,I wanted to defy the fate of Hyuga.
 I wanted to choose my own fate.
 That’s all.
 Overcome your own fate, Neji…
 Fate is something you work outwith your own hands.
 Father…
 This is…the truth!
 I’m sorry!
 Please…raise your head.
 Father…
 I wonder if a person’s destiny isonly floating like a cloud in a fixed current…
 Or is a person able to rideon the current that he chooses.
 I don’t understand it well yet.
 Whichever, the end pointmight still be the same…
 Just, when the choice is the latter…
 people turn toward the goal ofliving and work hard toward it.
 And those who hold thatare really strong.
 I feel like I finally understand,through this battle…
 And… father…
 I have only one goal…
 I want to become stronger,so I won’t lose to anyone.
 That’s how I feel now.
 Father…I see many birds flying.And they seem to be enjoying themselves.
 It’s buzzing.
 That’s because it was a good battle…
 Certainly, there’s that too, but…
 It’s likely that, for the curious headsof Ninja and the feudal lords,
 there is no match they look forward tomore than this next match.
 By the way, it seems thathe wasn’t seen at the opening ceremony…
 He’s arrived here already, hasn’t he?
 There’s been no news of Sasuke.
 And there’s the issue of Orochimaru.
 Before everyone starts to make noise,we should disqualify him…
 What’s going on?!Hurry up and start the next match!
 How long are you going tomake us wait!
 Before night falls!
 I wonder what’s going onwith the next match?
 Is Sasuke here?
 Sasuke…
 That guy…What in the world is he doing?!
 Is he planningnot to show up?
 A wise man never courts danger…
 A wise judgement…is it?
 What are you saying?
 He’ll definitely come! Believe it!
 But seriously, what is he doing?
 Keep this up and he…he’ll be disqualified.
 There’s no choice…
 Sasuke is…disqualified.
 Yes.
 Sasuke Uchiha is…disqualified?
 It has to be done.
 What in the world arewe going to do?
 If that guy doesn’t show up,our plan of strategy…
 This isn’t good…
 Could he have…?
 Where are you going, Gaara?
 I’m going to confirm my existence…
 Darn that Gaara…
 I wonder if he really killed him…
 Sasuke one more time…
 What happened?
 It’s obvious that you’re therestanding with the thirst for blood.
 Why don’t you come out?
 It’s you…
 Lord Hokage…
 I want you to consider waiting a little bitfor Sasuke Uchiha’s disqualification.
 I understand your point, but…
 No matter how excellent the Shinobi,
 to make light of time is nota qualification for Chunin.
 If there’s no clear reason to satisfy
 the heads of Ninja and feudal lordswho are here,
 there’s no reason to wait for him!
 I see…
 Well then, there is a sufficient reason.
 Including myself…
 most of the heads of Ninja andfeudal lords that are here…
 came here becausethey want to see the next match.
 However…
 He’s the remaining survivorof the “Uchiha.”
 Land of the Wind too, absolutely,is hoping for a bout with our Gaara.
 Lord Hokage…
 There’s no guarantee thatSasuke will come but…
 All right then…
 We shall specially postponethis match and wait.
 Lord Hokage! Really…
 Inform so to the Proctor!
 Y-Yes.
 However…
 It’s rare for you to insist like that,Lord Kazekage.
 Well…
 To show off the Shinobi’s qualitiesof our village to the feudal lords…
 there’s no better opponentthan an Uchiha.
 It’s a chance for us as well.
 C’mon, what happened to the match?!
 What happened to Uchiha?!
 I understand…
 Everyone! The candidate for thenext battle has not arrived here!
 We’ll briefly postpone this battleand start the following battle ahead of it.
 What is he doing…that Sasuke?
 Great, so Sasuke didn’t get disqualified!
 That’s good…
 Hey! That means my matchis one match closer!
 Then, on to the next pair!
 Kankuro and Shino Aburame!Come down!
 My match…doesn’t matter at all.
 More importantly…
 I'd rather not expose the Mechanismof Crow to the enemy before the plan…
 Proctor!
 I abstain!
 What?!
 I abstain!Please advance the matches!
 Due to Kankuro’s abstention,Shino Aburame wins by default!
 What’s that all about?!
 Have a proper match!
 You are…?
 It’s my turn, isn’t it?
 It seems that you’re really fired up.
 Okay, let’s go to the next match.
 Hey! The last one, come down!
 Hey! Hey! What are you doing,frivolously building things up?
 I mean, why does onlymy match have to be modified?
 Shikamaru Nara! You!
 Damn…lf it’s like this I’ll abstain too…
 C’mon! Shikamaru, fight hard!
 Damn that Naruto…
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

 It looks a bit strange that Shikamaruis fighting in the Final Round.
 He's good, firing up, burning up!That's my teammate!
 But, doesn't he seem spaced outlooking at the sky?
 He totally looks so ambitious.All right, Shikamar!

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said

 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off

 Because they want to change something
 The Three Villains from                    the Maximum Security Prison
 All right!
 I can start my training!
 Right now, this is all I can do.I can’t allow myself to fail!
 What’s up?
 Going to all the trouble of comingto pick me up like this…
 You’re on your way to Kurenai Sensei’safter this anyway, right…?
 Taking the time to converseonce in a while…
 that’s also part of teamwork.
 Let me hear about your mission.
 It was pretty incredible…
 But you wouldn’t understandeven if I explained it to you.
 I don’t want Akamaru to experiencethat kind of thing ever again.
 And for that reason, I must polishmy Jutsu all the more…
 I want to hear about it in detail.
 Because that’s what teamworkis about.
 Are you sulking
 ‘cause you were the only onewho was passed up?
 You are sulking, aren’t you?
 There have to be more further up…
 Until I can see it…
 I can’t believe you’re doingthat from the morning…
 Neji, let’s take a break.
 Okay!
 – Let’s go, Hinata! 					– Okay!
 Father, see you later.
 Barbecued meat?This early in the morning, huh?
 Just when he was looking goodafter losing some weight
 when he was releasedfrom the hospital.
 He made an amazing rebound,didn’t he?
 With that good an appetite,
 there aren’t any more worriesabout his health, are there?
 When I’m done eating,help me with my training, okay?
 Asuma Sensei!
 Hey, are you an idiotor something?!
 You’re recuperating, you know!
 L-Lee… Come on,let’s take a short break…
 What’s the matter, Guy Sensei?
 The prime of one’s youth waitsfor no one, you know.
 Maintaining the prime of one’s youthis starting to get tough…
 Thank you very much!
 Do your best, guys…
 I’ll master the Shuriken Jutsu bythe next time you’re here!
 M-Me too…
 I want to become a Kunoichijust like you, Temari…
 I’m honored.
 I apologize for asking youto teach at the Academy…
 since we’re so short-staffed right now.
 You probably would've preferredto go sightseeing or something.
 No problem.I’m doing this because I enjoy it.
 Yeah… And we were also able to survey
 the future potential ofthe Leaf’s military power…
 Well, be careful going home.
 Okay…
 If something happens again,I’ll come to your rescue again.
 Just let me know, crybaby.
 You always say too much.That’s why girls are…
 Let’s kick butt again today, Akamaru!
 All right, everybody’s here right?
 You don’t need to be so tense, Hinata…
 Y-Yeah…
 All right! Everybody stand ready!
 I can’t…lose to Naruto…!
 All right! I’m ready!
 I just have to waitfor Pervy Sage to come--!
 There he is!
 But my training…
 Don’t get so pouty, Naruto.
 Some work came in all of a sudden.lt can’t be helped.
 It’s just gonna be doingan interview
 for some obscene magazineanyway, right?
 That kind of thing isn’t called work.
 It’s a mission to gather informationabout the Akatsuki Organization.
 But if I tell this guy that,
 he might ask me tolet him come.
 Humph!
 I’ll make it up to you by…
 Huh?
 W-What’s this?
 It’s so that you don’t get boredwhile you’re staying at home,
 it’s a special training menuI put together!
 Wow!
 Wait, wait!
 My own prized secret trainingmethods are inscribed here.
 Don’t read this whereother people might see it!
 Okay!
 Well, do your best!
 I’m gonna use thisto train vigorously!
 Thank you, Pervy Sage!
 The walls have ears…paper doors have eyes…
 Pervy Sage’s secret training methods…
 WILLPOWER
 What?!
 Pervy Sage!
 Since I have been entrusted
 with the great Village Hiddenin the Leaves that you built,
 no matter what danger might strike,it is my duty to protect it.
 The Hokage sure has it tough, huh.
 Yes, you really do.
 Is that you, Shizune?Enter!
 All of these reports regardingthe village’s internal affairs accumulated
 because so many thingswere happening in the Leaf Village.
 I guess the only thing to dois start at the top.
 Leaf Maximum Security Facility.
 Did its name change?
 Yes, in the pastit was called
 Prison Specializing inCapital Offenses Ninja.
 Fortunately, because thereis a downward trend
 in felonies committed by Shinobi,
 along with the downsizing of the facility,the name was changed as well.
 Incarcerated are murderers,
 those who were involved inleaking classified secrets, and so on.
 They are all criminal Ninja…
 There haven’t been any noticeabledisruptions in the past few years
 and the facility has beenrelatively stable.
 – Food! 					– Food!
 It’s finally time to eat,isn’t it, Elder Brother!
 Yeah! I’m so excited!
 Hey! Fujin! Raijin!
 If you don’t shut up,you’re gonna go without dinner!
 Gimme a break! Those guys…
 You may pass!
 Hey! Wait!
 You’re hurt, aren’t you?
 Go to the dispensary laterand have that looked at.
 Okay…
 All right, next!
 H-Hey, Elder Brother…
 Huh?
 Why is the little fingershort and weak?
 That’s easy, Raijin.
 If the little finger was thick and strong,
 then your thumb wouldhave no leg to stand on.
 I-I see!
 Elder Brother…Elder Brother…!
 – Huh? 					– A lizard!
 Raijin, you’ve always beena dandy one from way back.
 W-We haven’t had enough to eat,have we, Elder Brother?
 Yeah…
 Not asking permission again…
 What’s the matter?
 What’s up this time?
 I’m starving…
 G-Give us something to eat!
 Oh no… If these guys find outI don’t have anything…!
 Um…right now…
 Don’t tell me thatyou don’t have even one offering…
 to these Fujin andRaijin brothers?!
 Well…wait…wait…!
 What do you think? Tastes good, huh?
 I’ll bring you something else later!
 Right now make do with that!
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Are you okay?
 Those guys are quietwhen they have food.
 But if they get angrythey’re out of control.
 Yeah…They annihilated all their comradesover food during a mission
 and the people around just barelymanaged to hold them down.
 Something smells good?!
 Yeah.
 This way!
 – Food! Food! Food!– Food! Food! Food!
 I just can’t get to liking clerical work.
 There’s still a whole lot more to do,Lady Tsunade.
 I wonder what this is?
 It looks like a formulafor some kind of medicine…
 A formula…
 Send an available Jonin hereimmediately!
 Yes, ma’am?
 Hurry!
 Y-Yes, ma’am!
 How about it…Does it taste good?
 I see…I see…There’s still a whole lot more.
 Just as I thought,
 that good smell was comingfrom your place, Elder Brother!
 Uh yeah…’Cause Elder Brotheralways has delicious food!
 It was worth sneaking, wasn’t it?
 ’Cause I’d feel so sorryif you guys had to go hungry.
 Elder Brother…
 – A lizard! 					– A lizard!
 I see, I see…Happy?
 How about it, you guys?
 Don’t you want to eat thingsthat are even more delicious?
 W-Where are they at?!
 If we go to the place wherean old friend of mine is…
 you can pig out on foodthat’s even more delicious than here.
 Is that the guy you told usabout long time ago, Elder Brother?
 Yeah, Lord Orochimaru…
 Gimme a break…that guy’s gotta be kidding!
 That Pervy Sage…
 just leaving me andmy training up in the air!
 Come on, don’t say that, Naruto.
 Master Jiraiya had a mission too.
 Heh!
 It’s probably thatLady Tsunade decided
 that only Master Jiraiyacould do the job…
 It can't be helped.
 Damn! So it was Old Lady Tsunade’sdoing, after all, huh!
 Well, I guess all I can do is treat youto some ramen noodles like this.
 So cheer up.
 I’m gonna go complainto Old Lady Tsunade!
 Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!
 N-Naruto!
 Damn… another annoying situation.
 Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!
 This is about a year ago,
 a Chunin Academy staff memberused Naruto
 to sneak outthe Scroll of Sealing.
 According to the report, it wasa crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.
 The crime was solved, but…?
 Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.
 The possibility has arisen thata bigger mastermind is behind this crime.
 This is a clue…
 This is something that Mizukiwas concealing
 when he was incarceratedin the Maximum Security Facility.
 At the time, nobody thought of itas anything more than a doodle.
 Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?
 I don’t know, however…
 The handwriting resemblesthe document confiscated from the facility
 where Orochimaru was conductinghuman experiments…
 Which means that…Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!
 The possibility of that is not zero.
 It’s not like a Chunin alone could doanything with the Scroll of Sealing.
 It would only make sense if Orochimaruwere pulling strings from behind.
 Asuma! Kurenai!
 Go immediately to the MaximumSecurity Facility and interrogate Mizuki!
 Orochimaru?!
 Be careful! Something’s strange here!
 Yeah… It’s too quiet.
 Let’s go!
 Oh, how touching.A welome party for us…
 Yeah…we’re giving you a big welcome.Right, Elder Brother?
 Yeah…
 Asuma, don’t tell me thatthose guys are…
 Uh huh…The legendary idiot brothers…
 Fujin and Raijin!
 Asuma…
 Hey, you guys are whooping it uptoo much for a welcome party!
 Hey, calm down…the welcome party’s just started.
 His character has changed completely…
 All you jerks…
 You will…be our offering!
 Do it!
 Orochimaru!
 Asuma Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What’s the matter, Ton Ton?
 What in the world happened?
 Say, weren't you togetherwith Shizune?
 Don't tell me something'shappened to her?
 I don't know what happened,but take me there, Ton Ton!
 I'm getting a bad feeling about this!

31,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Ugh... what are you here for now?
 It’s our reunion after so long,and you’re awfully cold.
 Don’t tell me that you came toassassinate Lord Hokage?
 No, no…
 I don’t have enoughsubordinates for that yet...
 I’ve heard of the excellence onesof this village
 and thought I’d put dibs on them.
 A little while ago, I gave thatsame Curse Mark as a present.
 There’s a kid that I want.
 Selfish as always.
 That kid will die.
 Certainly…
 The odds are 1 in 10that he’ll survive,
 but he may survive just like you did.
 This kid, you really like him, huh?
 Are you jealous?
 Are you still holding a grudge thatI used you and threw you away?
 Unlike you, that kid will excel...
 For one thing, he inheritedthe Uchiha ability.
 He has beautiful features
 and is a vessel whocan become my heir.
 If that kid lived,it makes things interesting.
 Be sure not to cancel this test.
 Three from my village are alsounder your care…
 Make me enjoy it.
 If something happensto deprive me of my fun,
 consider it the end of Leaf Village.
 We’ve secured food and waterafter spending half a day.
 And now most teams have halted activity.
 As we planned,this is the time that we attack.
 We'll split up into threeand go scouting.
 However, whether we findother teams or not,
 we return to this place.
 Got it?
 Okay.
 Roger.
 Okay. Scatter!
 Bushy-Brow’s Pledge:Undying Love and Protection!
 I can’t fall asleep...
 I need to protect these two.
 I slept great!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Did you take care of us?
 Thank you, Sakura!
 We’re totally better because of you!
 That’s good...
 A prey must always stay tenseand flee desperately
 in front of the predator!
 My voice is gone!
 It was just a dream...
 Is it daybreak already?!
 No, no way!
 A squirrel?
 Don’t surprise me like that!
 Oh!
 That was too close.
 Do you think she noticed?
 The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel...
 No, that’s not it.
 Huh? Then what? What was it?
 We’ll probably find out if we go closer.
 So... we should get going now.
 If I can catch all twenty of these leavesbefore they hit the ground
 Sakura will start to like me.
 If... if I can’t catcheven one of the leaves...!
 It’ll be an unanswered love forever.Or rather…
 You’re too Bushy!
 That’s what she’ll say.
 One, two, three, four...five, six, seven, eight...
 nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
 nine--! 					Ugh, nineteen...
 One more!
 That’s…!
 Phew... just in time.
 This is called a Paper Bomband it explodes after some time.
 Who did such an awful thing?
 Stop hiding and come out.
 Shoot! We scrambled to hide, you know?!
 Man, he’s a damn painand we've been discovered!
 Strategy One, “hide and let it pass,”was a failure!
 So now we carry out Strategy Two!
 Huh? Are you serious?
 What? You have a problem with that?
 There’s no question of success.
 Well, I guess it’s all right but...
 Wow! To meet last year’s Number Onerookie, Neji Hyuga, in a place like this!
 C-Can I have your autograph?
 So it’s just you guys?
 Take that! Strategy Two, “head over healsinfatuation with my sex appeal”!
 I’d been wanting to meet youfor some time, you know?
 Get lost!
 Why? Why doesn’t my sexiness work?!
 Shoot, it ticks me off, darn!
 Did you just raise your fists to me,and does that mean you want to fight?
 N-No... 					Of course not.
 Then get lost.
 Stealing a scroll from cowardly wimps like you
 would only make methe laughing stock of the village.
 Y-Yes!
 Huh... Really just like cockroaches.
 Just as I thought.
 A fellow like that wouldn’t takea scroll away from wimps like us
 unless we were to turn on him.
 All right! Let’s go find some wimps!
 Like I’ve been sayingthere’s no one wimpier than us...
 So a no-sleep lookout?
 But it’s not necessary anymore.
 Wake Sasuke up.We want to battle with him.
 Y-You bastards…
 What’re you saying?
 What is it you’re after?
 I know the one called Orochimaruis calling the shots from the shadows!
 Huh?!
 What’s that strange bruise onthe back of Sasuke’s neck?
 You did this to Sasuke.
 How can you say you want to fight him?!
 I wonder…what he has on his mind?
 However, I can’t stay quietafter hearing that.
 I will kill this girl,I’ll also kill this Sasuke character.
 Wait, Zaku.
 Huh? What is it?
 It’s so cliché.
 It’s the color of dirt that’s just been dug up.
 This grass, it doesn’t grow ina place like this, does it?
 Darn!
 You know, with a trap...
 there’s no point unless youmake it so it’s not discovered.
 Huh, how ridiculous!
 So that Kunai knife was so the squirrelwouldn’t be caught in the trap ?
 We kill her now!
 A log?!
 A trap above too? Watch out!
 Just kidding.
 What?!
 Clearly you have no talent.
 Someone like you needs tomake more of an effort or else!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 What?! This guy...
 Then you also should... make an effort!
 Who are you?
 I’m the beautiful blue beastof Leaf Village, Rock Lee!
 Why are you here?
 I will always appear...
 whenever you’re in trouble!
 Or should I say...
 It was really because of you,now run along.
 But right now, I’m alsoyour enemy!
 I did say this once before, didn’t I?
 That I’ll protect you until I die.
 Please go out with me!
 I’ll protect you until I die!
 Oh...
 T-Thanks.
 Yes!
 Perfect! I did it!Gu Sensei, that was perfect!
 I guess it can’t be helped...
 Zaku. I’ll give you Sasuke.
 I will kill them!
 As far as I can tell, Sakura is in no condition to fight.
 That Bushy-Brow guy is pretty proficient with Taijutsu...
 Looks like I can have some fun!
 There is a trick to your attack, isn’t there?
 I won’t just simply avoid it.
 You showed me your Jutsu before.
 This guy…he’s strong.
 Having said that,
 the odds aren’t good sinceit’s one versus three.
 I’m gonna have to take a chance.
 One person at a time...
 I’ll give it my all and take each down!
 There’s no one at all that seems wimpy!
 Well, the only team that’s weakerthan us is the Naruto team.
 Idiot! You know what you’re saying?
 What?!
 No question Naruto and Sakura are lame!
 But that team hasthe super genius Sasuke!
 Hah! I wonder...
 In actual battle that geniusmight easily be beaten.
 What?!
 All right, all right,I apologize for irritating you.
 What a pain...
 I say one negative thing aboutSasuke and I get the evil eye, every time…
 There’s no way Sasukecould be taken down!
 Sakura’s a different matter though!
 Huh?!
 Hey! Sasuke has collapsed...
 Huh?!
 ...and Sakura is fighting.
 What did you say?
 Hey!
 He’s late.
 That Lee...
 Something’s not right.
 He’s always precise about time.
 Perhaps he ran into the enemy...
 Could it be...?
 Huh, that wouldn’t have happened.
 In any case, let’s find Lee!
 Right!
 Yes! I’ve finally mastered it!Yes! Yes!
 My friends, there’s no reasonto give up on your youth!
 This Jutsu...
 In the end, only Lee could make it his own.
 Yahoo!
 – Hey Lee...– I did it! I will do it!
 – Lee! 					– When I try! I try!
 Hey, Lee!
 Hey!
 Listen to this passionate messagefrom your teacher!
 Oh... what is it?!
 Please tell me using hip words.
 This Jutsu, the “Lotus”...
 it will be dealt with henceforthas a forbidden Jutsu.
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 W-What do you mean?
 This Jutsu poses a great burdenon the cells of the muscles,
 it’s a kind of “Self-sacrificing Technique.”
 Humans normally utilize,at most, 20 percent...
 of the “power” that the muscles have.
 Do you understand?Only 20 percent!
 And if nearly 100 percentof the “power” is used
 the muscles themselves will disintegrate.
 So, the brain usually controls the “power.”
 However, this Jutsu forces thebrain’s limiter to go off by using Chakra,
 allowing high speed continuous Taijutsu...
 In other words, this is a dangerous Jutsuwhich relies on a secret technique
 that brings forth “power” almost to the limit of one’s body.
 So the only time it is all rightto use this Jutsu
 is when a certain condition is met...
 So... when is that?
 Take this to heart...
 The condition is
 Guy Sensei...
 I will utilize that Jutsu without reserve.
 Because this is the time you said...
 ""When protecting a previous person!""
 He disappeared?!
 Oh, oh no!
 There's no way he can break his fall!
 Take this!
 Primary Lotus!
 This feeling...
 Well well...
 Just in time.
 T-That's impossible!
 That is a frightening Jutsu...
 It did this much even thoughI fell on the spongy dirt.
 It's now my turn.
 Oh no!
 With what I just did...
 Lee!
 Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
 But our Jutsu exceeds that
 and is the speed of sound!
 I'll show you there are walls
 which effort alone can never break through.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 I'm so frustrated!
 I'm just pulling feet again.
 I'm always just being protected.
 I always just watch them from behind.
 This time, I need to protect everyone!
 Naruto, Sasuke, Lee!
 I want to be like you too!

 By the way...
 why are you guys here?!
 Hah... It’s such a painto explain it to you.
 Everybody helped out.
 Huh?
 Sakura’s putting on a show of bravado...
 I’ll take care of him from here.
 Ah... Okay...
 Keep it together! Lee!
 Oh? Tenten, why are you here?
 I came to help.
 Huh...?
 Those guys,where’s the Sound Village Ninjas?
 A kid named Sasukedrove them away!
 Really…
 Why did you hastily decidedto act on your own?!
 Besides, you really got beaten up!
 S-Sakura was in danger.So as a man, I...
 You’re kidding...!
 If it were Lee alone,he wouldn’t have lost to those guys.
 You’re really stupid.
 I can’t argue with that.
 You, Bushy-Brow!
 Naruto!
 Don’t say rude things to Lee!
 What in the world...
 happened while I was asleep?
 That Naruto,he’s completely out of the loop.
 He’s not the type to bethe protagonist of a story, certainly not.
 Lee...
 Thank you.
 Because of you,I was able to wake up.
 I feel like I’ve gotten a little stronger!
 Sakura...
 It looks like my effortsweren’t enough!
 Sasuke... Just what you’d expectfrom the Uchiha clan.
 To chase off the Sound Village Ninjas,
 just as I thought,you possess amazing strength.
 I was beaten to a pulp.
 What?! He was beaten to a pulp?!
 What’s he talking about?
 Were those guys really that strong?
 Sakura!
 The Lotus of Leaf Villageblooms twice.
 Huh?
 When we meet again,I will have become a stronger man.
 I pledge it.
 Okay.
 Hey Sakura!
 Come here, come here!
 Your hair! I’ll fix it for you!
 That'd be great.
 You are really sneaky.
 Hugging him like that,you little billboard brow.
 It’s called first come-first served,Miss Ino-pig.
 Sasuke... Uchiha.
 At any rate…he’s a strong opponent.
 Are you okay, Akamaru?
 Is he still shaking?
 It’s already been half a day.
 Akamaru...
 I don’t blame him, it’s because he saw that thing...
 After all, brains are most importantin survival!
 Right. Akamaru?
 Lucky for us,
 the guys who got caught inthe trap had an earth scroll!
 We’ll be the first tothe tower at this rate!
 Don’t get carried away.That’s dangerous.
 No matter how small a bug it is,it has to guard itself at all times.
 We have to pay attention to avoidcoming across any enemies...
 This is safety.
 I know that!
 As always, you’re speaking in a waythat’s difficult to understand, bug-nerd.
 Um... B-But...What Shino said...
 He has a point.
 I know! C’mon.
 Naruto...
 I hope nothing’s happened to him...
 Hey you two, stop.
 We’re being careful not tocome across enemy, right?
 Then Hinata!
 Can you see 1 kilometerin that direction?
 Yep... I’ll have a look.Byakugan!
 T-There’s someone there.
 Evidently there are... 6 people…
 Okay! Let’s go look!
 Huh?
 Kiba! What are you saying?We’re not doing that.
 The Proctor told us to bring
 one of each “Heaven” and “Earth”scroll in a pair.
 He didn’t say not totake more than that.
 If we take more, that meanssome other teams will be left out.
 B-But...
 We’ll just see what’s going on at first..
 If it looks too dangerous,we won’t battle for no reason.
 – Let’s go! 					– Oh!
 He’s an irritating type, that one.
 What’s up, Akamaru?
 What happened? You stopped suddenly.
 Akamaru suddenly got frightened.
 W-Why is that?
 Akamaru can sniff out the level of enemy’sChakra and tell his strength.
 But this is the first time I’veseen him this scared.
 The people going at it up aheadaren’t ordinary guys...
 Sand Village kids comingto challenge us forthright.
 It’s foolish.
 What’s that little guy thinkingto get involved with those guys...?!
 W-What is Akamaru saying...?
 He’s saying that big guy is dangerous.
 T-They certainly look like bad news...
 They seem really strong.
 Hey, kids, you shouldpick your opponents...
 You’re all going to die.
 That’s enough of you.
 Let’s do this quickly...old chap from Hidden Rain Village.
 Which scroll do those guys have...
 Hey Gaara!
 Doesn’t it make sense tofollow them
 and gather informationbefore hunting them?
 If they have the same type of scrollthere’s no need to fight.
 Unnecessary battles are….
 It doesn’t matter.
 If their eyes meet with mine...I’ll kill them all.
 That’s why I don’t want to be with this guy.
 Well, let’s do it. Quickly!
 Die, kid!
 Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
 Hidden Senbons!
 Up down right left,there is no dead spot in this Jutsu.
 In addition, all the Senbons arecontrolled by my Chakra
 and attack on the intended prey!
 Too easy.
 Is that all?
 I-It can’t be...?!
 Not even one...?
 No wounds...? Ridiculous!
 Senbon Rainstorm, huh...?
 Well, I’ll make it rain blood.
 What a giant Chakra.
 And, that sand...
 It smells terrible.
 Smell?
 A strong smell of blood...
 Wall of sand...?
 That’s right.An absolute defense by sand!
 He manipulates sand insidea gourd and
 hardens it with magnified Chakra.
 It defends the circumferenceof Gaara’s body.
 It’s a Jutsu that onlyhe can get away with...
 Furthermore, it’s somehow alwaysautomatically done
 without Gaara’s intentions.
 Which means that all attacksin front of Gaara fade into nothing.
 That little...
 You guys can’t defeat our Gaara.
 Don’t underestimate me!
 This guy's a goner…
 That’s what you get for rebellingagainst Gaara...
 Sand Coffin!
 I can’t move...
 T-This won’t...!
 I can cover your loud mouthand kill you.
 But that’s too pathetic.
 Sand Burial!
 There’s no pain.
 I knocked him even harderthan was necessary.
 The bloody tears of a corpse mergewith vast sinking sand
 and provide more powerto the demon of war.
 T-The scroll.
 We’ll give it to you!
 Please! Let us go!
 No-o-o-!
 T-This is bad.
 Let’s escape quickly!lf he finds us he’ll kill us!
 Luckily it is a Heaven scroll.
 Okay! Let’s go to the tower.
 Shut up.
 It’s still…not enough for me!
 U-Uh-oh! Did he notice us?!
 Let’s quit... Gaara.
 Are you scared, coward?
 Gaara! It’s certainly no problem for you,but it’s too dangerous for us!
 One set of scrolls is good.
 More than this is...
 Lame people don’t give directions to me.
 That’s enough!
 How about if you sometimes listento what your big brother has to say?!
 I’ve never thought of you as my siblings.
 If you get in my way... I’ll kill you.
 G-Gaara cut it out! Please.
 Don’t say something so cold.
 As a favor to your sister... Okay?!
 Gaara!
 Fine.
 That’s why I hate brats.
 What? So that’s it Akamaru?
 C’mon, you should havesaid something sooner.
 Nobody’s here...?
 Heh heh! We’re the first?!
 No, I sensed someone a little while ago.
 More importantly, is Akamaru okay?
 He’s been scared ever since then.
 Now that you mention it,what did Akamaru say before?
 Oh... Akamaru said that itwas dangerous
 because that sand squirtwould kill that big guy.
 Sheesh! Just like I thought,there’s no other place to go!
 They’ve already made uswait for half a day!
 How much longer do we have to wait?
 Anyway. That Sand Village squirt...
 I don’t know what he is but,that guy…
 He’s too dangerous.
 It’s becoming a real disaster,but we can’t cancel this test.
 What do you mean?
 Excuse me!
 What is it?!We’re talking about something important!
 Excuse me.
 But... Uh...
 Please take a look at this!
 The video...?
 Ready? Here! Look at the time!
 T-This is…
 It’s a recording inside the tower,
 one hour and thirty-seven minutesafter the start of the second test!
 Three Ninja from Hidden Sand Villagebroke through the second test.
 This can’t be...!
 In a mere ninety-seven minutes...
 This has never happened!
 This is an anomaly.
 Those guys are not Genin level.
 They’ve rewritten thefastest time by four hours…
 It’s not just that.
 What do you mean?
 It’s 10 kilometersfrom the test entrances to the tower.
 Ferocious animals, poisonous insects,the rugged forest road...
 As if those were not there…
 Especially the brown-haired kidright in front…
 What about him?
 You don’t notice?
 I see. This is quite a surprise.
 What about him is so...?
 Look closely at his body.
 I see.
 He doesn’t have a single scratch.
 What’s worse, there's nota smudge of dirt on his clothing.
 Even I...
 No, any of the other Chunin...
 It’s impossible for us tomake it to this tower without a scratch.
 It’s likely that it has somethingto do with his ability.
 After a long time, a dependableguy has appeared.
 Even though he’s got evil eyes.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 – Please! 					– No!
 – Just a little bit. 					– No!
 – Really only a little bit.– No means no!
 I’ll just look a little and put it back.
 Remember what theProctors said, loser.
 When they say don’t look, don’t look,
 it just makes me wantto look all the more!
 If you can look when you can,let’s look!
 Naruto lost it!
 Sakura! Get a hold of Naruto!

 Plea from a Friend
 That's Naruto?
 What is this intimidating power?
 And what was thatred Chakra earlier on?
 Is this guy a monster?
 What the heck are you?!
 Your friend!
 That’s why I’m telling you
 I’m not gonna let the likesof Orochimaru get you!
 I’m telling you that I’ll stop you…
 even if it means breakingevery bone in your arm and legs!
 Fire Style:Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Come on! Wake up, already!
 If you don’t come to your senses,I'll have to break your bones
 so that you can’t moveand I'll take you home that way, Sasuke!
 Shut up…
 What the heck do you,
 who has neither parents nor brothers,think you understand?
 What makes you think that you,who's been all alone from the start,
 can understand anything about me?!
 It’s because I have the tiesthat I feel this agony.
 How could you possibly understand…
 what it feels like to lose all that!
 It’s true that I can’t understand…
 how it feels to reallyhave parents or brothers…
 However…
 It’s my treat today…Eat your fill!
 Yippee!
 When I’m with Iruka Sensei,I imagine…
 – Dig in! 					– Dig in!
 Ninja, first of all, need towarm their inner man.
 Hey! Hey! Don’t get too carried awayand overeat!
 If this is…what it feels like to have a dad.
 When I’m with you…
 Idiot, idiot, idiot…
 What was that, you loser?!
 I’m not gonna lose to you,no matter what!
 Go ahead and saywhatever you want.
 How about this?
 Better not start feelingtoo comfortable.
 I wonder…if having a brotherfeels something like that.
 Why is it, Naruto…?
 Why is it that you go tothis extent for me…?
 For me it’s a tie thatI’ve finally been able to have!
 That’s why I’m gonna stop you.
 It’s too late, Naruto…lt’s already too late.
 I can’t go back anymore.
 Come, Naruto!
 In that case,I just have to cut that tie.
 Cut, huh?
 Then why wear that headband now?
 I’ll acknowledge you…You’re strong.
 And the reason for that is
 you’re someone who knowsthe pain of solitude as I do.
 And that pain makes people stronger.
 And for that very reason,by cutting that tie,
 I will be able to obtaineven greater strength.
 I will fight you now on equal terms.However…
 You won't even be able toinflict a scratch on my forehead.
 That’s something thatwon’t change in the least.
 It seems that whatever I saywon’t have any effect anymore, huh?
 Sasuke!
 I’m done with talking…
 From here on, it’s only fighting.
 Come!
 I’m able to see…
 I’m now able to seethis guy’s movements…
 which I wasn’t able to see before.
 I’m able to see them!
 Sasuke’s moving completelydifferent from a few moments ago.
 But I couldn’t care less!
 In any case, I can’t afford to lose!
 Damn it!
 It must be the influence of my bodygetting used to the state of Curse Mark.
 When he moves…
 by the subtle movements inthe way he exerts his strength…
 I can vividly seean image of his next move.
 With my level of “eyes,”
 I don’t need to use unnecessary Chakraand can instead preserve it.
 The Curse Mark takestoo much Chakra.
 If I can see this much…
 I can time my attacks to the images ofNaruto’s movements as I foresee them.
 This is no good…
 He’s totally reading my movements.
 Damn it!
 Oh, there you are.
 There’s no mistake it’s this way, right?
 Right.
 We better hurry.I have a bad premonition.
 Sasuke!
 Fire Style:Dragon Flame Jutsu!
 Sa-su-ke…
 It’s too late, Naruto.
 It’s too late now! Naruto!
 You're weak, aren’t you, kid?
 You better be grateful to me…
 and to the Fourth Hokage
 who contained me withinthe likes of you!
 What’s going on?
 What was that just now?
 Even if I’m able to readNaruto’s movements completely…
 his Chakra makesa separate move of its own.
 It seems like the Chakra itself is movingin accordance with its own will…
 Even with my “eyes”I’m unable to read it completely.
 That red Chakra…that’s not an ordinary Chakra!
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 To abduct Narutois the No.1 priority
 placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
 I see…
 It appears that you havesome kind of special power.
 Now I understand!
 Fire Style:Fire Ball Jutsu!
 That Chakra is protecting him?!
 Calm down.
 I won’t be caught as long asI fight from distance.
 Damn it… This is incredible!
 All I can do is dodge…
 Please let me get there in time.
 Damn it, gimme a break…
 If I get tainted by this power …
 I don’t even know whatwill happen to me in the end…
 But, it can’t be helped,can it, Naruto?
 It is certainly truethat you were special…
 However…
 I am even more special than you.
 Sasuke!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Damn! My body hurts!
 And to make it worse,
 I’ve completely lost feelingin my left arm!
 Apparently this powerisn’t something that
 I can just keep on using continuously!
 But …I can’t give up!
 My next blow isgoing to be the end!

 Was that some eagle poopjust now?
 Nothing there, huh?
 Well, I worked up a sweat,
 so I guess I’ll go homeand take a shower.
 A Legend from the Hidden Leaf:The Onbaa!
 I worked upa good sweat today too.
 What’s the deal, Akamaru?
 He says you smell bad, Naruto.
 Are you making sureto take a bath?
 Don’t be saying rude things!
 No, you seriously stink.
 Come to think of it…
 The poop from the eaglea moment ago might…
 Sakura.
 Oh, I found a slackerwho can’t get a mission!
 That’s just…I’m not that much a slacker!
 So it seems. You must’ve donesome reckless training.
 It’s ripped.
 Huh? You’re right. I didn’t notice!
 It can’t be helped.
 Bring it to me later.I’ll sew it up for you.
 Really?! Really?! Really?!
 Sakura, you’re such a nice person.
 It’s the first time in my life…you’ve been this nice to me!
 H-Hey, Naruto. You’re exaggerating.
 Naruto!
 Wh-What’re you doing, Sakura?!
 You touched my breastjust now, didn’t you?!
 I didn’t do anything like that!
 Then, what’re those hairy handssticking out from your armpit?!
 What’s…that?
 Huh? Huh?!
 Wh-What’s this?!
 Your back.
 Huh?
 Wh-What in the world is this?!
 It’s a huge poop!
 Idiot! That’s some kind of creature!
 Is it a caterpillar?!
 What?! Get it off.
 No, this is an animal.
 Let go!
 Give me a break.
 You guys, have you ever heardof the legend of Onbaa?
 Onbaa?
 I’ve never heard of it!
 Shizune! You don’t know?
 Nope. Is that legend something likean old tale or something?
 That’s what I thought, but…
 Long ago when I was young,I heard about a legend…
 A legend about a dangerous,hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa
 who lived deep in the mountainsnear the village…
 One day, that idiot Jiraiyaeagerly went into the forest
 saying he was going to investigatethe Onbaa
 for his summer vacationindependent research.
 The Pervy Sage?
 Yes…
 Are you an idiot?
 Do you seriously thinkthere’s an Onbaa?
 Well, you’ll get yours whenyou see my independent research!
 Who would?
 Even if there were an Onbaa,it wouldn’t deal with you…
 You said it! Flat-chested girl!
 Who’s flat-chested?!
 No way is there such a thingas an Onbaa!
 You wanna bet on that?
 Yeah! I’ll bet!
 Then, I’ll bet on Jiraiya.
 Huh?!
 Then, I’m off to wrestlewith an Onbaa!
 And? Did the Pervy Sagemeet an Onbaa?
 When he came back three days later,
 he said he won witha force-out move…
 which most likely was a lie.
 Oh! here it is.
 Huh? What’s this?
 What lousy writing!
 You’re one to talk, Naruto.
 Let’s see… The Onbaa is big.lt is nine-feet tall.
 The Onbaa is scary.
 No one is a match for itwhen it gets mad.
 But I beat it at wrestling.
 What’s this?
 The Onbaa’s child likesbeing carried piggyback.
 They grow up on the parent’s back.
 What?!
 What Jiraiya wrote is bogus,tracing the legend as is, but…
 So there was an Onbaa…
 Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,
 it stays piggyback on my backand won’t get off.
 What should I do?
 According to legend,the child Onbaa considers
 the first thing it sees after birthas its parent
 and clings to the backof that person.
 It seems they grow that way,piggybacked on the parent,
 until they become an adult.
 It seems until then,they never leave the parent’s back.
 Then, there’s no other waybut to wait until it grows up.
 You say that, but when it grows up…
 it’ll turn into a scarynine-foot tall monster, right?
 What’s up withthat straightforward reaction?
 Well, it’s a legend,so it’ll probably get off eventually…
 Don’t be so irresponsible!
 H-Hang in there, Naruto…
 We’ll be cheering you onfrom behind the scenes.
 Come up close rather thanbehind the scene, damn it!
 What is it?
 I won’t lose, you know!
 This isn’t a weight, man!
 What is it, Hinata?
 Naruto… I heard a strange rumor.
 A strange rumor…you say?
 That you…umm…had a child.
 Oh. You mean this?
 Huh?! Hinata!
 Hey! You okay?! Hinata!
 Hinata, Hinata!
 Hinata?!
 What’s the deal?You’re sure an extravagant guy…
 Oh!
 Am I going to have to take a bathevery time he pees on me?
 Ichiraku Ramen
 You know, we don’t allow pets.
 The Leaf Village public healthdepartment is strict, you see.
 I missed dinner because of him.
 Overlook it just for today.
 But now that I look closer,he’s cute, isn’t he?
 So, what’s his name?
 He’s saying it himself,so I guess Onbu is okay.
 Onbu, huh…?
 Doesn’t he want to eatsome Naruto fish cake?
 Here.
 Old man!Give me a whole roll of Naruto!
 Coming right up!
 Ever since you clung to my back,
 I’ve been getting nothingbut odd jobs like this.
 Well, I guess it can’t be helped…
 He’s gotten big…! And so quickly…
 This is bad!
 Naruto Uzumaki,you are assigned a mission
 for the removal of the mountain banditsfrom Yamabuki Pass!
 Removal? Hey old lady…
 Onbu’s gotten big,
 so you intend to get ridof the troublemaker, right?
 N-No, it’s not like that.
 I was thinking you’ve hadsome eye-opening growth recently, so.
 Then, what about the other members?
 No…
 Since you’ve shownsuch remarkable growth,
 a solo infiltration should be fine.
 Sure enough,it’s getting rid of the troublemaker!
 This is also fate…Okay now, back to work.
 Thanks, mister!
 N-Naruto, Naruto.
 Things are fun whenyou’re around, Onbu!
 That Grandma Tsunade.
 Don’t think you were able toget rid of the troublemaker so easily.
 I’ll beat the mountain banditsand finish up this mission lickety-split
 and the two of us will returnto the Leaf Village with pride!
 Right, Onbu?!
 Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!
 Who’re you, creep?!
 Who’re you?!
 What do you want?!
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!
 Prepare yourselves!
 – Say what?! 					– Get him!

 Heh! How was that?!
 Die!
 Onbu! You saved me!
 Onbu… I owe you my life.
 Let’s get back to the village quickand surprise everyone!
 Onbu! No way will I believe thatyou’re a dangerous creature!
 We’ll go as the Onbu-Naruto teamsucceeding the Kiba-Akamaru team!
 What was that?
 It’s okay…
 You’ve got me with you.
 Onbu?! No, it’s huge!
 Could it be…you’re after Onbu?
 Are you Onbu’s mom?!
 W-W-W-Wait! I didn’t steal him!
 Onbu! Say something, will you?!
 Y-You idiot, Onbu!
 No, y- you’ve got the wrong idea!
 Onbu, it’s your mom.
 It’s not my intention!
 Damn it! I had a rough time of it.
 If you're a mother,
 then take better careof your child, really!
 It’s okay! I’ll return Onbu to you!So rest easy.
 Huh? My body got light.
 Huh? Onbu? You got so big!
 Huh, wha--?What’s the matter, Onbu?!
 What’s the deal?!
 W-W-W-Wait… Onbu, it’s me!Can’t you tell?!
 We were getting alongso well just a moment ago!
 Please remember me!
 It’s me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki!
 Oh, yeah! Naruto!
 Naruto! Naruto!
 Onbu, look at this!
 Remember!Remember this spiral!
 Naruto, Naruto!
 You remember my back you clung tothe whole time, don’t you?
 Have I…had it?
 Onbu…
 I’m tired…
 This feels kind of good…
 It’s like I’m being carried piggyback.
 Onbu…
 Onbu!
 Live in good health with your mom.
 All right!
 My sides…are splitting!
 Onbaa is now no longer a legend.
 They’re thriving in the village forestand seriously proliferating.
 The stupid eagles carried them in, so.
 Naruto! How’d you tear it off you?!Tell me!
 Who knows?All I did was wrestle with Onbu.
 Don’t be so mean!
 At this rate,the village will be crushed.
 Tell me! Naruto!
 Don’t look at me.
 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 Shino and I have beensent to a certain village to deal with
 a dispute over a family headwho passed away.
 An old woman suddenly appearson the road and says this to us.
 “Even dead men laughin Motoyoshi Village.”
 They were mysterious words.I never imagined it at this time.
 To think I would see withmy own eyes,
 a sight in this village too frighteningto even talk about…
 Next: “Laughing Shino.”
 I can’t even go to the bathroomalone at night.

 As long as the score isn’t settled,
 the clock inside my heart willremain stopped in the past!
 Lord Sagi, if you livefor revenge,
 your heart will sinkinto darkness!
 If it means that I am ableto carry out my revenge…
 I don’t care if my heart sinksinto darkness!
 That’s exactly right.
 I hold a grudge against you,I hate you…
 My only purpose in livinghas been to kill you…
 Sasuke!
 I've…
 I’ve survived!
 I’m finished with messing aroundwith you Leaf Village guys.
 I will go to Orochimaru!
 I can’t…let you go there…
 I cannot allow…!
 you to go there!
 I wasn’t able to stop a comradewho was sinking into darkness…
 However, I won’t let you go there,no matter what!
 You pesky little…
 If you get in my way,I’ll consider you an enemy too!
 There’s no way you guys…could ever understand!
 It’s a trick device!
 No one can hinder my desire!
 What was that?!
 It’s no good!
 We can’t get out!
 Farewell! Ninja of the Village Hiddenin the Leaves!
 Lightning Blade!
 There!
 How did you figure it out…?!
 Because I’ve seen your Jutsuwith these very eyes…
 I remember now… 					You are…
 Hatake…Kakashi…
 The Copy Ninja withthe Sharingan…
 Your Jutsu doesn’t even faintly mirrorthat of Gaara’s…
 You’ve only scratched its surface…
 All you’re doing is leavingyour main body elsewhere
 and using your Chakra to manipulatethe rocks and sand…
 We are nomads…
 ridiculed as lower-ranked Shinobiwithout a village…
 That’s why we travel around the country,stealing Jutsu, sharpening our skills,
 struggling to one day find our wayinto a place in the sun.
 But no matter how dedicatedour efforts are…
 to think there are dimensionsthat cannot be transgressed…
 That’s the direction ofthe Feudal Lord’s palace…
 Hurry up! Lord Sagi’s thoughtto be buried beneath there!
 Damn it!We really got screwed…
 That jerk!
 What a jerk… Gimme a break!
 What happened…
 Huh?
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Sagi totally squashed us just nowand went off somewhere!
 Gimme a break…that guy’s some kind of jerk!
 Please don’t blame him forthe things he has done.
 But…!
 He is himself,but not himself right now.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 He is obsessed with avenging
 his father andyounger sister’s deaths.
 I believe he is possessedby the ghost of the late Lord Owashi.
 Oh come on… Stop joking…
 That’s not necessarily a joke.
 Stop it! That kind of thing gives methe creeps!
 Get a grip! This isn’t the time to besquabbling over things like that!
 What’s important right nowis to find Sagi!
 But we have no ideawhere he went.
 If he is possessed,
 it is certain thathe will return to take revenge…
 And moreover…very soon…
 Elder Brother…lf I were to lose you too,after having lost our father…
 I could not go on living…
 Father…Elder Brother…
 I shall join with you…
 Elder Brother!
 Elder Brother…I will avenge this without fail…
 I will once more restartthe hands of time for you, Elder Brother,
 whose time was brought to a standstill…
 Until the day that wish is realized…
 I will live as you, Elder Brother,as Sagi!
 Sagi’s temperament is such thathe will undoubtedly come here for Moso.
 It’s actually quite convenient
 that Lord Sagi comesall the way here to see me…
 Even if I can’t get my handson Sagi, the Feudal Lord,
 it’s not a crime to kill himas the Cursed Warrior.
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 What a joke… A ghost appearingin a child’s toy…
 You have some nerve appearing herelike this…
 Cursed Warrior…
 Lord Sagi…
 Huh…who are you…?
 Aren’t you the high and mighty Moso?
 I won't answer to words like that
 from the likes of a ghost.
 Damn you!
 That’s right…
 Moso is just a fictitious nameused to deceive the world…
 My name is Hoki…
 The Leader who headsthe Wandering Ninja…
 In place of not having a village,we the Wandering Ninja
 steal Jutsu from every villagewe pass through and make them our own!
 But our family has tired of livingfor so long as nomads.
 And we have been searchingfor a Land to call our home.
 I see…
 From the very start,
 you came here to the Land of Birdwith the intention of taking it over!
 There’s no way thatsomebody like you,
 who was born destined to becomea feudal lord…
 could understandthe suffering of Wandering Ninja
 who do not have a homeland!
 I don’t see a problem…
 with the Wandering Ninjaseeking a safe homeland.
 After all, your father was someonewho easily trusted others…
 He never even suspected anything
 when I switched with the monk Moso,highly reputed for his virtue,
 and neared him…
 He misinterpretedmy Genjutsu of deception
 as being the holy powerof the virtuous Moso
 and put me on the fast track…
 The only person who suspected mewas Komei.
 I assassinated Owashiand drove Komei away…
 Y-You jerk…so it was you, after all!
 And the last step is to kill you, Sagi.
 If I can do that, I will have accomplishedwhat I set out to do!
 You jerk! I won’t forgive you!
 Revenge for my clan!
 You are…?!
 Yes, that’s right!
 My name is Toki!
 Lady Toki…!
 I will avenge my fatherand brother’s death!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 Look at that, Toki…Our shadows are overlapping, right…
 That’s the Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 With this, you won’t be ableto move anymore!
 But I wouldn’t have imagined thatyou would be the younger sister Toki…
 The Wandering Ninja will be successfulin taking control of this land.
 You will die as Sagi justas you desire!
 Lady Toki! Keep your composure!
 Chishima…
 So you were alive, huh…
 I was unaware of your feelings, Lady Toki.
 Chishima is most ashamed!
 Take this and die!
 I overheard everything just now.
 Sagi, I mean, Toki!Leave the rest to me!
 Naruto…?!
 That’s not gonna happen!You will die by your own shadow!
 The shadow has nothing to do with it!
 You’re just under the influenceof his Genjutsu!
 What?!
 Lady Toki…
 Shadow Possession isShikamaru’s Clan's Secret Jutsu!
 There’s no way you couldeven hope to imitate it!
 Not only is your identity fake,but your Ninjutsu is too!
 Who the hell are you?!
 Naruto!
 The heavens are watching your villainy!
 There is no way we will forgive you!
 Why you Leaf Ninja…But it’s only a Clone Jutsu!
 Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 They have substances?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Sasuke’s Phoenix Flower Jutsuis much more awesome!
 It’s my turn this time!
 Damn you!
 Kakashi Hatake…
 So you’re here too, huh…
 Hoki, the leader who headsthe Wandering Shinobi…huh…
 I’ve heard rumors about you…
 So you’re a Shinobi who wandersfrom place to place like a bat…
 Ninja from a rich village can’t possiblyimagine circumstances like ours…
 Like hell I’ll understand it…
 The Leaf are taught that the Way of Ninjais to become a Ninja who can endure…
 People like you who trick peopleand wishfully try to seize land
 have no right to call themselves Shinobi!
 Elitist!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Damn! That’s a real dragon!
 No way!
 Wait…!
 Wait!
 Over there, huh…
 What’s up with that?
 So the Summoning Dragonswere fake too …
 He fled off somewhere…
 Inside the mansion!
 I’m not letting him get away!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hey you…wait!
 Where did he vanish to?!
 Hey, Leaf Ninja…
 Huh?!
 Wh-What?!
 If you want to have Toki back,come over here…
 H-How?!
 Take that boat to come over here…
 Genjutsu?
 Are you scared,you Leaf apprentice Ninja?
 I’m not an apprentice!
 This place…don’t tell me it’s…
 What’s that?
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Chishima…
 believed in youuntil the very end.
 He truly loved this land…
 and he worried about his friendsfrom the bottom of his heart!
 And yet…
 And yet…!
 I won't forgive you, you bastard!
 I'm gonna beat the hell outta you!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther

 If you’re not the one

 I'm going...
 to become the Hokage.
 I can’t lose here!
 You? Hokage?!
 When you’re weaker than me?
 I’ll become... Hokage for you!
 Transform!
 Hey hey, are you serious?
 You’ve been here three years
 and you can’t even doa respectable transformation?!
 All of you watch now!
 I will absolutely someday becomethe true and a real Hokage!
 Lame! What Hokage?!
 You know deep down inside thatyou can’t become the Hokage.
 So quit acting tough!
 You’re wrong Kiba…
 If you compete with me forthe name of Hokage…
 You... will be the loser!
 Surprise Attack!Naruto's Surprise Weapon!
 Man! Same thing over and over again.You're pesky!
 Well, never mind.
 I’ll just make it soyou won’t stand up again!
 Let’s go, Akamaru!
 You think you can get me withthat same technique again?!
 Take this!
 Darn!
 Fang Over Fang!
 This Jutsu…
 Though, I’ve seen it before…
 it’s not a Jutsu you can dodgeover and over!
 What do I do?
 What should I do?!
 Looks like you’ve got nothing left.
 I’ve got plenty left!
 Even if you increased yourself bythree or four, I’d still have a lot left!
 You’ve got a comebackfor everything!
 Let’s finish him with the next!Akamaru!
 Darn!
 I have to counterattack somehow.
 Even if I do, it has to get Kibaor there’s no point!
 But which is which…?
 W-What will you do? Naruto!
 Naruto…
 T-That’s it!
 Transform!
 You’re mine!
 I see how it is…
 Huh?
 There, look closely.
 Oh!
 You did it!
 That’s a clever move, Naruto!
 Naruto!
 If he transforms into Kiba,
 the real Kiba doesn’t know which isAkamaru and which is Naruto…
 He can’t attack carelessly.
 However, it’s okay for Narutoto attack either one!
 Oooh!
 He created a chance opening…
 Good work!
 I see, so that’s your move…
 But…
 I’ll give you a piece of advice!
 I was careless before anda little late to realize it…
 But the Transformation Jutsuisn’t effective anymore!
 Why, you ask?
 Yeah!
 I can smell you.
 Don’t mess with oursense of smell, Naruto.
 By concentrating his Chakrainto his nose,
 Kiba’s sense of smell is enhanced tensof thousands times more than average.
 Of course, he can determinepeople by their smell too.
 Heh, I won!
 W-What?!
 What's going on?!
 Kiba’s nose got Naruto andAkamaru mixed up?
 Darn! What in the world is going on…?!
 Then you’re Naruto!
 Messing with me!
 What?!
 Well, this is coming fromthe original prankster, after all…
 He’s had it!
 He did it!
 Naruto… Awesome!
 Darn it!
 So that’s it…
 Naruto, transformed into Kiba,
 was discovered by the real Kibawith smell and hit…
 But Naruto didn’t come backin true Naruto form.
 Instead, he transformed intoAkamaru instantly!
 In order to make it look as if itwas Akamaru who was hit
 and his impersonationtransformation dissolved!
 Was Naruto ever that smart…?
 You little…!
 Think hard about your Jutsubefore you use them!
 Because they’ll be usedagainst you, stupid!
 He’s using my line, word to word…
 Arguing with this guy is onlya waste of time!
 Don’t go at Naruto’s pace…
 Calm down.
 Calm down!
 He can’t actually keep up withmy movements yet…
 I still have the advantage!
 Look closely at Naruto’s movementsand if there’s an opening…
 I can surely take him frombehind with the All-Four Jutsu.
 Nothing to get flustered about…
 If I do this in a level-headed manner,it’s a match I will most certainly win!
 Evidently your enemyhas become calm…
 Well, what will you do, Naruto…?
 So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba?
 Well then... I’ll end this…
 with my new special techniqueI’ve been saving up!
 So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba?
 Well then... I’ll end this…
 with my new special techniqueI’ve been saving up!
 What?!
 New special trick?!
 Huh? When did he…?!
 Leave it to Naruto to hidea new technique!
 What new special technique!
 That’s obviously a bluff!
 You can test out whetherit’s a bluff or not!
 This hasn’t changed since before…
 Don’t let his pace get to you.
 Calm down!
 Let’s go!
 I don’t know what kind oftechnique this is but…!
 I just won’t let you do it!
 Now!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…All-Four Jutsu!
 Q-Quick…
 Why are you stopping?!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Just as I thought, this is asfar as he will go.
 Stand up! Naruto!
 D-Darn! I don’t even have timeto work up my Chakra!
 Hey hey! What’s wrong?!
 Naruto!
 He’s fast!
 It’s no good.
 He doesn’t have time toform hand Signs!
 There’s too much of a differencein their strength…
 It’s impossible for Naruto, after all.
 Naruto…
 D-Darn!
 Take this!
 What?!
 Take that!
 I’m going to be Hokage!
 I won’t lose here!
 Whatever! You can’t keep upwith my speed at all!
 Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!
 Naruto!
 This is what it’s like whenI really let it out.
 You understand, don’t you?
 To me, you’re merely…!
 I...
 Huh?
 will absolutely not lose!
 That Naruto… He’s a fighter.
 Yup.
 If I were Kiba,I’d be sick of this already.
 It doesn’t matter which anymore,I just wish they’d settle it quickly.
 Naruto...
 Fight!
 Naruto! Use the new techniqueor whatever!
 Just settle it!
 Naruto! Go for it!
 I have to find some openingin that darn Kiba…
 You’ve got absolutely no effect on me!
 You’ve got spirit, I’ll give you that!
 He’s close at his end…
 I’ll settle it with the next one!
 I’ll make the new techniqueexplode no matter what!
 I won’t let you!
 You’re slow!
 Take this!
 Oops!
 Fast movements and a keen nose…
 The Ninja Art of Beast Mimicryturned out to be harmful…
 Right now Kiba’s sense of smellis tens of thousands times
 more powerful than normal…
 Well…
 That fart was probablya freak accident, but…
 That’s what you’d expect fromthe number one unpredictable Ninja.
 Naruto!
 Now’s your chance!
 Darn!I was straining too much…
 But now’s the time to showmy new technique!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto!
 Okay! The way you’ve torn meapart up until now,
 I’ll give it back all at once!

 A new technique, eh?
 Well, he was watching Sasuke’stechnique a moment ago…
 Lion Barrage!
 For the record, the nameis a rip off, too.
 The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
 Ohhhh!
 Cha!
 Nice one!
 You did it!
 That Naruto beat Kiba!
 It’s a major upset…
 Yup!
 Yes!
 I’m…getting stronger!
 That was easy!
 W-What to do?
 What should I do…?
 N-Naruto...
 Huh? Hinata?
 Did you say something?
 Ah, ah, ah… 					Umm…
 Huh?
 Hinata…?
 What's this?
 It’s an ointment.
 Why for me?
 Take it for her, Naruto.
 Hmmm. Okay!
 Thank you! You’re nice, Hinata!
 Kiba, it’s nothing to beembarrassed about …
 This kid was a reallystrong opponent.
 You are taking this pretty easy,aren’t you, Lady Hinata…?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What’s with that guy!
 Calling people failure and judging them!
 Blah blah blah blah blah blah!Talking like a wise guy!
 I’m in a bad mood!
 Hinata, you say something!
 Get that guy!
 Show that guy that peoplecan really change!

 I’m a writer rooted in realism!Getting a picture is important.
 So I wonder if you’d do that for me.
 Can you write if I do that?
 I’ll write, I’ll write!
 Sexy Jutsu:Steam Bath Harem Version!
 – Master Jiraiya. Jiraiya!– This is great!
 Won-der-ful!
 What a hopeless guy!
 He hasn’t been able to write at all!
 Address, check!Zip code, check--!
 Ow-ow-ow…
 Oh, the sealed documents…
 Please take extra care with this.
 I will take it for you.
 Ow-ow-ow…
 Excuse me, can I also ask youto take this for me?
 Oh! Mister Naruto.Thank you for helping me out yesterday.
 Oh! Mister!
 I am 596-03.
 It’s hard to remember!
 More importantly, I want to ask youto take care of this!
 Hmm…This goes in a different direction…
 Have a heart. Please.
 Oh, perfect timing.
 Huh?! Is this a Shadow Clone?
 He is 463-72.
 This area should be in your jurisdiction.
 It is.
 Then I leave it to you…What was it again?
 I am 463-72.
 Hurry, okay?
 Wake up…
 Whoa! I fell asleep!
 Pervy Sage, let’s start training!
 What’re you talking about?I must complete the manuscript…
 You don’t need to worryabout that.
 I wrote the manuscript andsent it to the publisher!
 So now you can devoteyourself freely to training…
 Right, Pervy Sage?
 You idiot!
 Huh?
 If something like this were read,it’ll be the end of my writing career!
 Ah… Oh… I’m sorry.
 You said you sent it tothe publisher, right? How?
 I gave it to a Delivery Ninjain the inn…
 D-Delivery Ninjas.
 You mean, the one that delivers anyparcel to the addressee, no matter what…
 not influenced by any land or institution…that iron organization?!
 After him, Naruto.
 We’ll chase down the Delivery Ninja,no matter what…
 and retrieve your manuscriptat any cost!
 If he’s going to the publisher,he should definitely take this path.
 Now what’s left is how toclose the time gap…
 I hear the leg power of Delivery Ninjasis extraordinary, though…
 Pervy Sage!
 Slow down the pace a little, man.
 Naruto! This is also training!
 To be straight, you’re short on leg power!
 A Ninja must apply oneself,
 connecting this with training,no matter what the situation!
 Excellent, Pervy Sage.Now you’re talking!
 It’s just like a maze!
 We’re totally lost…
 If we had Hinata’s or Neji’s Byakuganat a time like this…
 Byakugan! I didn’t think of that!
 That’s the Rasengan, isn’t it?!
 I’m sorry!
 Uh, no, you see…!
 This isn’t the time to be drooling!
 There he is!
 After him, Naruto.
 R-Right!
 Thieves!
 Hey, wait!
 There’s no fool who’d waitafter being told to wait!
 As it happens,
 the parcel this person hereleft with you this morning is a slip-up!
 That’s right!
 I have no knowledge of that.
 The rule for us Delivery Ninjas
 is to deliver parcels once leftwith us to the destination,
 even if we have to risk our lives!
 My life as a writer is also at risk!
 Don’t look at me.
 This is trouble!
 Sorry.
 To do that to someonewho’s doing honest work…
 Shut up! When you get right down to it,it was you who…
 Huh?! What’s this?!
 This isn’t the thing you wrote!
 Oh!
 That time! It got switched withmy manuscript!
 Say what?!
 This is…a secret document directed
 to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangsfrom the Land of Claws…
 Let me see…According to the information I’ve gotten,
 the Fang and the Claw could goto war at any moment…
 This is a secret document for peace!
 They’ve decided on peace?!lt’s written here.
 That’s a good thing, isn’t it?!War is no good!
 You! You idiot! The fact thatthis secret document is here means
 the manuscript you wrote is being takento the Land of Fangs!
 What’ll happen if they read it asa secret document
 from the Land of Claws?
 This is bad! No doubt, war will begin!
 We’re going to the Land of Fangs!
 R-Right!
 This time for sure we’ll take backthe manuscript!
 Postal thieves…my customer’s important parcel…!
 This is bad!
 This is 463-72. This is 463-72!
 A postal robbery has occurred!
 The thieves are a pair,
 a large man with a perverted lookand a kid!
 ""They appear to be after 596-03’s parcel.""
 ""Members in the area are assignedto protect 596-03!""
 ""Stop the thieves in the nameof the Delivery Ninja!""
 The only way to get to the Land of Fangsis to go up this river.
 More than likely they will also goby boat.
 Then depending on our speed,there’s a chance we’ll catch up.
 I’m the one who’s got it rough.
 You don’t have enough physical strength!
 Consider this also as trainingand apply yourself!
 That again?!
 Who’re those guys?!
 It appears reinforcementshave been summoned.
 Hurry, Naruto!
 Naruto! Switch places!
 Rasengan!
 Rasengan!
 Somehow…the Rasengan looks likea really cheap Jutsu…
 It’s for the sake of preventing a war!
 Our mission of peace is at stake!
 – Right! 					– Switch.
 Huh?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Rasengan!
 Rasengan!
 That’s it!
 Hey, wait! It’s a slip-up!This is the real one!
 They got switched during the commission!
 Delivery Ninja old man,it’s the truth!
 I’m sorry.
 According to our rule,we are never to look inside
 a customer’s parcel we have taken on,no matter what.
 If that passes over to the Land of Fangs,
 there will be war!
 Even if that were the case,I must not break the rule.
 You’re impossible!
 It’s the Land of Fangs!
 All we do is carry out our duties!
 Then…we’ll take it awayby force if we have to.
 – Postal delivery!– Postal delivery!
 Naruto! Do you know which one it is?!
 No, I don’t!
 I am 596-03.
 I know! It’s 596-03!
 Where is he?!
 Up there!
 Naruto, you hold back the front!I’ll rout the rest!
 Got it!
 I won’t let you go past here!
 In the name of the Delivery Ninja,
 I will not let anyone interfere!
 You’re an impressive old man…
 I too, in the name of the Leaf Ninja,
 will take away the manuscriptwith a Jutsu!
 Let’s go!
 Harem Jutsu! Riverside Mad Dance!
 Mis-ter De-li-very Nin-ja.
 No, no! This isn’t the time to bedoing something like this.
 Now, to get cracking with my delivery.
 Deliver…
 I will deliver.
 Hey, where are you going?Play with me.
 No, no! Not that way.
 I’ll do my best!
 Guys! Give me a hand!
 – Right! Yeah. 					– Okay!
 P-P-Postal delivery.
 Okay, good work.
 This guy’s iron will is the real deal…
 We’re too late, huh…?
 Is war going to start?!
 Th-This is--!
 It’s a manuscript of the latest issueof the Make-Out series!
 That Land of Claws feudal lord…!
 To think he’d know I was a big fanof the Make-Out series!
 Everyone!
 Stop the fighting!
 Send a messenger tothe Land of Claws!
 Don’t let anybody in…
 I kind of don’t really get it, but…with this, there’ll be no war?
 No war is fine…
 But does this mean my writing poweris the same as Naruto’s scribbling…?!
 Now then!
 Today’s the day the Akatsuki Organizationguy comes!
 We’ll capture him no matter whatand get information about Sasuke…
 Pervy Sage?
 Sorry, Naruto. There was a developmentwhile you were sleeping.
 I will pursuethe Akatsuki Organization as is.
 I’ve been had!
 Well… I suppose it made forsome good training…
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 All right, everyone, follow me.
 Wait.
 We’re heading forthe Village Hidden in Stars
 on a mission to protecta mysterious star.
 Naruto!
 Man, I’m getting fired up.
 We all need to work together here.
 Now, let’s all unite and showthe boundless power of the Leaf.
 Hey, don’t be following us likeit’s matter of course, Naruto.
 You’re not listed asa member for this mission.

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 This is a Hidden Village that has producedmany superb Ninjas.
 – Hey Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?!– You're really gonna get it this time!
 The number one prankster of the village,Naruto Uzumaki,
 is a boy who is alsostriving to become a first-rate Ninja.
 I don't care!
 Transform!
 His strongest skill is the Sexy Jutsu.
 –You fool!– However, Naruto had a secret inside him.
 – Stop making idiotic spells!– that even he didn't know about.
 At one time, the nine-tailed fox drovethe Village Hidden in the Leaves
 to the brink of destruction…
 That nine-tailed monster fox issealed within Naruto's body.
 – Look at that one. – Therefore, he's been abhorred
 – I hear he's the only one who failed.– as the Demon Fox by village grown-ups.
 Serves him right.
 Imagine what would happenif he becomes a Ninja.
 Okay, you may open your eyes now.
 Congratulations on your graduation.
 However, that Naruto,
 – Iruka Sensei!– on my sufferance,
 – That hurts!– graduates from the Ninja Academy.
 Say cheese!
 He starts off on his first step as a Ninja.
 Ninja missions are conductedby three-man cells.
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 A descendant of the Uchiha clan,
 a distinguished family inHidden Leaf Village.
 He is a boy towards whom Naruto harborsintense feelings of rivalry.
 Sakura Haruno is a Kunoichi whoNaruto has the hots for.
 As a Ninja, Naruto carries out missionswith these two rookie Ninjas.
 The one who observes andinstructs them,
 Kakashi Hatake,also known as the Copy Ninja,
 is the Leaf Village's most skilled Ninja.
 One day, Naruto's group takes onthe mission to guard Tazuna,
 a master bridge-builderof the Land of Waves.
 All right! We're off!
 However, Tazuna is targeted by a mannamed Gato
 who attempts to controlthe Land of the Waves.
 Stop your darned grumbling…!!
 – Next time I'll kill him with...– And Gato had hired a terrifying man
 – head chopper!– for Tazuna's assassination.
 Zabuza Momochi…
 A Rogue Ninja of the Village Hiddenin the Mist.
 He was a man who had excelled atSilent Killing and
 had successfully carried outmany assassinations.
 Naruto and the gang havea tough time of it
 in the face of Zabuza's attacks…
 Hey! You, with no brows…
 Record in your Bingo Bookabout the man
 who'll one day becomethe Leaf Village's Hokage.
 Naruto Uzumaki!!
 It's not so easy!
 A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow…!
 However, the shoe is on the other foot,
 thanks to Naruto and Sasuke'sclose team work.
 Kakashi copiesZabuza's Jutsu with Sharingan.
 – W-What's that?!– It breaks Zabuza's composure.78	01:05:42:24	01:05:44:29Me...?
 R-Ridiculous!
 Is that his Genjutsu (illusion Jutsu)?
 The Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!!
 No way!
 It's over…
 A Tracker Ninja boyfrom A Hidden Mist Village
 is the one who deliveredthe final blow.
 I must get rid this corpsebecause it contains many secrets.
 Now then, please excuse me.
 However, this boy, Haku...
 was Zabuza's comrade.
 Will you be all right the next time?
 The next time…
 I'll be able to see rightthrough the Sharingan.
 Kakashi who has inferredthat Zabuza is still alive,
 gives Naruto and gang…
 – Ready!!– new training in preparation...96	01:07:15:05	01:07:17:23– Here I go!		– for Zabuza's second assault.
 And then, 					One week later...
 This mist…
 Sasuke! Sakura! They are coming!
 This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
 So it seems.
 The time has come!
 Secret Jutsu…
 Crystal Ice Mirrors!
 Now then… I'll start.
 Take this!
 Naruto Uzumaki…
 is finally here!!
 The Number One Hyperactive,Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!
 Now that I've come, you're all right!
 Oh…
 Naruto!
 The hero of a story generally appearsin this kind of situation
 and takes out the enemy in no time!
 Heh… That brat, eh…
 He's long on talk...
 Man, that idiot!
 Making such a conspicuous entrance…
 There's no point if you don'tcatch the enemy off guard!
 That boy…
 What're you doing in a placelike this from morning?
 Training!!
 Why are you training?
 I want to get stronger!
 All right, here I go!Shadow Clone Jutsu…
 Huh?!
 Oh, no!
 Huh?
 Get out of the way, Naruto!
 Whoa!
 What?!
 He's saved…
 To think the enemy attackswould cancel each other out…
 That was super lucky…
 Hey! What're you doing, Naruto?!
 Hey! What kind of idiotwould attempt
 to cast a Jutsu directlyin front of an opponent?!
 What?!
 The essence of a Ninja is deception.How you deceive your opponent.
 Even casting one Jutsu,you avoid the eyes of your opponents,
 catch them off balance,and outsmart them…
 The way you made your entrance earlier,that's just you coming to be a target…
 N-Nooo.
 But I went to the troubleof coming to the rescue.
 What concerns me more than that is…
 That guy…
 Haku… What's the idea?
 Zabuza, leave this kid to me…
 Please let me fight this battle my way.
 What did you say…?
 So you mean no interfering…Haku?
 You're naive…as usual…
 I'm sorry…
 Naive, eh…
 True enough…
 Judging from these wounds,
 there's no mistaking thatI was attacked with a Senbon.
 But no vital areas havebeen targeted so far.
 Does he mean to half-kill me…?
 If so!
 As for me, I'll take you out first, so...!
 It's impossible.lt's too much for Naruto!
 I should be the one to…
 Hey. Don't get any ideas…
 If you move,
 you know what'll happento that old man, right?
 True…
 If I move away from here andhead towards Naruto,
 Zabuza will kill Tazuna.
 No way can Sakura completelyprotect him by herself.
 How about it?
 Let's just see how those young guysfight against each other.
 That mask…
 You were Zabuza's comrade, after all,weren't you!
 You've got nerve to deceive us!
 I'm sorry.
 But, your teacher also said it,didn't he?
 Things like deceiving andcatching one off guard is a Shinobi's duty.
 Please don't take it personally.
 You don't have that luxury, either!
 Huh?
 Sasuke?
 I haven't…forgotten about you.
 Here I thought he had disappeared…but he was there…
 I would rather you hadjust gone down quietly.
 But it looks like it won't workthat way.
 Fine. I'll put an end to it first.
 H-Hey!
 Naruto. I'll get to you later.
 W-What's with him…?
 This is it!
 So the real body is over there, eh…
 Okay!
 I'm over here.
 He moved…? How?!
 – Sasuke! 					– Sasuke!
 What was that just now?!
 Sasuke's body suddenly got battered…
 How's he doing it?!
 What kind of Jutsu is he using…?
 It's conceivable that he has cloneshide in the mirrors and
 gets them all to throwthe Senbons simultaneously…
 No, they're too fast considering…
 What does it mean...
 not being able to see eventhe trajectory of the weapons…?
 Also, if it's a mere Clone Jutsu…
 I don't see a reason forthese ice mirrors…
 In any case, there's no way to questionthat these mirrors are pivotal for his attacks.
 What I can do is to launch attacks…
 from both the outside and inside.
 The thing to do is to figure outthe meaning of the mirror!
 I'll take care of here!
 All there is to do is…
 for me to attack the inside and have Narutotry attacking the mirrors from the outside.
 Yo! I came to save you.
 You okay, Sasuke?
 Oh…
 What good will it do youto catch your ally off guard…?
 Y-You idiot!
 If you're a Shinobi,you'll move more cautiously!
 What's with you?!
 I came to the rescue, you know!
 If you also come inside the mirrors…
 Dang it! I've had it, you fool!
 Fool?What do you mean by fool?!
 As to be expected of thenumber one unpredictable Ninja.
 He is making the situation worse andworse by coming to aid.
 Since it's come to this,all that is left is to smash the mirrors!
 Fire Style!
 Hey! What're you going to do?!
 These are mirrors madewith freezing water…
 If so…
 Fireball Jutsu!
 It's not working at all!
 They won't melt with thatlevel of firepower.
 Darn it! Where'd he attack from?!ls it the clones?
 Where's the real body?!
 It's useless for you to evenattempt following with your eyes.
 I absolutely will not be caught.
 Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Don't!
 If so, I'll find out which isthe real body by hitting them all!
 This is a teleportation Jutsu that usesmirrors that can reflect only my image.
 Watching you from the speed I move,
 it almost seems as ifyou aren't moving at all…
 I knew it!
 Is that Jutsu…the Kekkei Genkai?!
 Kekkei…Genkai…?
 It's the same type as my Sharingan…
 Deep blood ties…Lineage of paranormal individuals…
 A type of Jutsu that is passed ononly through those traits…
 Then…!
 That's right…
 It's impossible even for meto copy that Jutsu…
 And there's no way to destroythat Jutsu, either!
 Darn it…
 So…what?!
 I can't die here yet.
 'Cause I have a dreamthat I must turn into reality…
 The dream to have my strength recognizedby everyone in the village…
 and become the Hokage!
 Dream…
 Pathetic brat.
 Brats like you aren't neededby anyone
 and die without ever knowingany freedom or dreams…
 You have the same eyes as I do…
 For me, becoming a Shinobi completelyis difficult.
 If I can, I don't want to kill you guys…
 And I don't want to get killedby you guys…
 But if you guys aregoing to come at me…
 I'll kill my feelings with a sword andcompletely become a Shinobi.
 This bridge is the battlegroundthat connects each of us to our dreams.
 I, for the sake of my dream.
 And you, for the sake of your dreams.
 Please don't hold it against me…
 I want to protect the person dear to me…
 I work for the sake of that person,I fight for that person,
 and I want to make thatperson's dream a reality…
 That's my dream.
 For the sake of the dream,I will completely become a Shinobi...
 and kill you guys!
 Crystal Ice Mirror defeated!
 Cuz' I've finally discovered the wayto break through it!
 Heh-heh. Okay, Sasuke.
 Let's pull out of this place andgo assist Kakashi Sensei.
 I've had this bad feeling froma while ago.
 Sensei, Sakura, please hold out somehowuntil we get there.
 Next episode: ""Zero Visibility: The Sharingan Shatters.""
 As for me, I'll kick butt once again!

 The Promise That Could Not Be Kept
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Where’s Sasuke?
 Kakashi!
 How is Naruto Uzumaki’s condition?
 He’s okay.
 What about Sasuke?Where’s Sasuke Uchiha?!
 How are the other Genin?
 Yes! By Lady Hokage’s order,
 the first and second medical corpshave been dispatched…
 The wounded from all areas havealready been gathered.
 They were convoyed afteradministering emergency treatment.
 How are their conditions?
 Yes! Shikamaru Nara has minor injuries…
 Kiba Inuzuka has serious injuries,but it’s not life-threatening.
 Neji Hyuga and Choji Akimichiare in serious condition…
 At this point,there’s no telling what will happen.
 Everyone…
 The ingredients andeffects of the medicine
 have been thoroughly researched.
 Excellent…
 Now bring the deer antler!
 Yes, ma’am!
 How is he…Big Sister?
 No walks for him for quite a while…
 The muscles of his limbshave been severely damaged.
 You’re a vet, right, Big Sister?Can’t you somehow…?
 It’ll be okay.
 It’ll take time. But there’s no threatto his life, so rest easy.
 Walks for you are out of the questionfor quite a while, too!
 Yeah, I know…
 Intensive Care Unit 7
 It’ll soon be three hours…Please take over.
 All right!
 Although we’re makingthis kid’s hair into a conductor,
 please don’t mistake the cellular rateof the deficient parts!
 Right!
 As for the Chakra control, handle itas if we’re threading a needle!
 Understood!
 Intensive Care Unit 6
 There’s no point inyou getting frustrated, right?
 Missions come with sacrifice…
 You took the mental training, right?
 Training and actual battleare different, you know…
 I know what missions are about…
 And I thought I knew whatthe Shinobi world is like.
 I became a platoon leaderfor the first time on this mission.
 With that, I understood…
 I’m not cut out to be a Shinobi.
 Surprisingly fragile…for a man.
 This time…
 The only thing I was able to doas platoon leader…
 was to believe in everyone.
 I was naïve…
 I didn’t have enough power…
 It’s all my fault!
 Are you afraid of getting hurt?
 Shikamaru…
 Are you going to be argued downby a girl and run away?
 It’s a drag…
 I don’t want to have arguments.I’m not a woman.
 Yeah… But you’re not a man, either.
 You’re just a coward!
 Even if you quit being Shinobi,the missions will continue.
 Someone has to do it.
 Your comrades will justbe dispatched again…
 under a different platoon leader.
 And your comrades might die there.
 But if at that time,you were the platoon leader…
 your comrades might be savedfrom that happening to them.
 If you reflect on this time,make use of the experience and learn,
 you might be able to carry out missionswith more perfection.
 If you really think your comradesare important to you,
 before you think about running away…
 think about becoming more exceptionalfor the sake of your comrades!
 That’s what real comrades are,you coward!
 Intensive Care Unit 6
 He’s okay, now!
 The antidote has stoppedthe death of cells
 caused by the side effects of the Pills.
 You were a big help this time, Shikaku!
 The Nara Clan’s secret medicinalpreparation manual was very useful.
 It must’ve been tough tomake something like that…
 It’s the result of day-to-day study.
 Thanks…
 Lady Tsunade!
 Neji Hyuga…His safety line has been secured.
 And, there’s some information…
 Kakashi Hatake and Naruto Uzumakihave just now returned.
 Although seriously injured,it seems it’s not life-threatening.
 Two, huh?
 Shikamaru…lt seems the mission is a failure.
 But, everyone is alive!That’s the most important thing.
 Next time for sure…
 I’ll carry out the mission perfectly!
 Sasuke…You’re the chosen one.
 Whatever… Just give me “power.”
 Even though the form is different,it’s still Lord Orochimaru before your eyes.
 If you don’t want to die,use more care in how you talk.
 Wh-What? This quality of Chakra…
 Yes… My future is inside this kid…
 Hidden Leaf Hospital
 I’m going to where Orochimaru is!
 Please…bring back Sasuke!
 I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail!I promise that on my life!
 Oh…You were awake, huh?
 Shikamaru!
 I’m going on ahead to Choji!What about you?
 I’m going on ahead to…Naruto and Sasuke!
 I see… So everyone’s okay.That’s good.
 Then, Sasuke…
 Yeah…he's gone.
 Intensive Care Unit 6
 Then, I still can’t see him…?
 Yeah… But Lady Tsunade said thathe should regain consciousness soon.
 Thank goodness…
 It’s really a great help that
 Lady Tsunade returnedto the Leaf Village.
 If she hadn’t, right about now,Choji would be…
 The Lady Fifth…Hokage.
 You’ve come to visit?
 Information sure travels fast.
 Sakura…
 Naruto…
 I heard you sufferedquite a serious injury…
 But you look well, considering.
 I’m sorry… Sakura…
 Why do you apologize?
 Being you, you probablygot reckless again, right?!
 Jeez, you look like a mummy…
 I’m sorry… I…
 Hey… The weather’s nice today.So open the curtains.
 Sakura! I…
 I’ll keep my promise, no matter what!
 I promised on my life.That’s what I said, so I…!
 It’s okay already, Naruto…
 Sakura! He…
 I always…
 said that, so… I…
 I stick straight to what I say!
 That’s my Way of Ninja!
 Naruto…
 Thanks, Naruto…
 I’ll get right to healing this injuryand I’ve got to bring Sasuke back!
 Wh-What was that?!
 Per…Pervy Sage?!
 Yo!
 I’ve come today to tell yousomething important.
 From here on,as my official disciple,
 I’ll train you to becomea full-fledged Shinobi in three years.
 Three years…?
 I’ve received some credible informationfrom a certain source
 concerning the “Akatsuki.”
 Akatsuki…
 It seems that it will bethree or four years
 before they come after you next.
 I don’t care about that!
 Talking about stuff that’sso far down the road…
 I don’t have the timeto be doing slowpoke training!
 What do you mean?
 If I don’t go afterSasuke immediately,
 he might be killed by Orochimaru!
 “Immortal” doesn’t mean thatthe flesh is being maintained as is.
 Before his body decays,
 a strong and new flesh will be madeinto a vessel for his soul.
 It seems you’ve learnedof the true purpose
 for Orochimaru seeking Sasuke…
 Huh?! Then that means you also knew…?
 I was looking intoOrochimaru’s Immortality Jutsu.
 It seems with that Jutsu,
 he can’t reincarnate intothe next body for three years.
 And unable to wait for Sasuke,he just recently reincarnated…
 It’ll be okay for three years from now…There is time.
 That’s not a lie, is it?!
 Not a lie, is it?!
 Nope…
 However…
 Forget about Sasuke…
 Sasuke went to Orochimaruon his own accord.
 No matter what you do,he won’t change.
 I’ve seen many Shinobi, so I know…
 Sasuke is the same kindas Orochimaru.
 If you’re thinking about bringing him back,just forget it.
 That’s something an arrogant foolwould do!
 He may be nothing to youbut he’s my friend!
 Would a friend hurt his comrade?!
 Take a look at your current plight!
 This is…!
 Why? Why would you…?
 We were called Sannin together…
 Weren’t we comradessince we were kids?!
 In every regard,you’re a foolish guy, Jiraiya…
 You lack thoughtin everything you do.
 That’s why you didn’t noticewhat I was doing.
 Can’t you rethink it, Orochimaru?
 Absurd!
 How can you be so stupid?!
 No matter how much I wanted it…
 in the end, there was no wayhe would come back.
 After the agony, all that’s left wasmy own powerlessness and regret.
 I don’t want you to go throughthe same thing…
 If you’re going to go after Sasuke,then there’ll be no training.
 I’ll get Anbu Black Ops to watch you
 and depending on the case,prohibit you from leaving the village.
 You’re not just an ordinary kid…
 You possess the Nine Tail Foxthat the Akatsuki is after!
 This is serious.I'll just have to do that…
 if you’re going to act on your ownwithout listening to what I say.
 Eventually, you’re going to have to deal
 with guys more troublesomethan Orochimaru.
 Give up on Sasuke.
 Sooner or later this wasgoing to happen.
 Don’t suffer anymore!Forget and dismiss him.
 It’s not just Jutsu or power…
 If you’re a Shinobi, develop eyes thatcan make the right judgment.
 And if you’re going to liveas a Shinobi, become wise.
 If you remain a fool…
 the reality is that it will be toughliving in this world.
 Fine.
 If that’s what being wise is…
 Then I’m fine being a fool for life!
 Even if by myself,
 I’ll create even more awesome Jutsuand save Sasuke no matter what!
 And, and,I’ll even kick the Akatsuki’s butt!
 If someone like youwere to do it alone…
 the best you’d be ableto come up with
 would be somestupid erotic Jutsu, anyway.
 It might somehow work out
 if you are a big fool andnot an ordinary fool…
 Be prepared onceyou’re out of the hospital,
 you big fool.
 See you then.
 Roger!
 – It’s been seven years since…– …all the members gathered like this.
 Since Orochimaru leftthe organization.
 That Orochimaru has gottenthe Sharingan.
 Itachi…Your little brother?
 Don’t get hasty. Yeah.
 We’ll kill Orochimaru eventually…
 More importantly,there are only three years left.
 Can everyone accomplishthe work required of them?
 Huh?
 Yes, our goal is…
 to get everything,including the Nine Tail Fox in question!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Sakura’s been weird all alongever since Sasuke left.
 I can’t put it well,
 but she’s gloomy or frettingor something.
 On top of that she says,“This time I’ll do my best on my own.”
 What the heck does that mean?
 It’s bugging me, it’s bugging me!
 This isn’t the time for meto be relaxing in the hospital!

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 Pure Betrayal,                                and a Fleeting Plea!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto! Grab on!
 Okay, pull him up!
 There, eh?!
 Damn! Was it a clone?!
 Over here!
 Counterattack, here it comes!
 Rasengan, go!
 What--?!
 You little…!
 Yes!
 Be careful, Naruto!There are two others hiding!
 Hey, there they are!
 Kagero!
 Let’s retreat for now!
 Hold it!
 Th-They’re totally quickat running away!
 Naruto, why’re you spacing out?!
 Where’s Sakura?
 Oh! Oh, no!
 Sakura!
 Oh! Naruto…
 Thank goodness!You’re okay, Sasame.
 Yes… Sasame’s okay.
 Sasame's totally okay.
 What’re you mad about?
 Let’s take a break here.
 Sakura…Who’s the cute girl?
 Okay! That’s close enough…
 What’s the deal…Sakura?
 Okay, don’t come any closer!
 Wh-What… I’m only interestedin adult women!
 You must not misunderstand…!
 Don’t misunderstand!
 It’s not a misunderstanding.
 It seems Sakura’s finally figured outPervy Sage’s true nature!
 I told you to stop calling mea “Pervy Sage”!
 Then you’re the Lewd Sage!
 Both of you stop it! Sasame’s scared!
 – Okay. 					– Okay.
 Jeez…
 This girl is Sasame…
 She’s a Ninja fromthe Land of Rice Paddies…
 A member of the Fuma Clan.
 She had her cousin taken awayby Orochimaru
 and was looking for his hideout.
 Right. And the Ninja just nowwere after Sasame
 in order to protect the secretof the hideout!
 Oh…With the Fuma Clan, huh?
 Huh?! You know?
 I had contact with Ninja in the townwho’d left the Fuma Clan.
 What! So you were actually doingsome serious investigating, Pervy Sage?!
 I-I can’t believe it…!
 Well you see, when I went tothis nice-looking bar,
 it just turned out to be their hideout.
 What! So after all, you were justhanging out with some girls, right?
 You mustn’t talk in a way that’lllead to a misunderstanding!
 Even Sakura who respects me will…
 I’ve long since stopped respecting you!
 I…I see…
 Members of the Fuma Clan…?
 Yeah. The boss was called Hanzakior something…
 Hanzaki and the others are traitorswho abandoned the clan.
 Oh…
 Did those people do something?
 They were after my travel money,so I taught them a lesson.
 While at it, I attempted to ask them aboutOrochimaru’s hideout…
 but they didn’t know anything.
 I can show you the way toOrochimaru’s hideout.
 For real?!
 Yes…
 All right!
 Your wound hasn’t healed yet.Don’t push yourself.
 Yes…but…
 This is the entrance tothe Village Hidden in Sound.
 Orochimaru’s hideout is deepin those mountains…
 I bet Sasuke issomewhere in those mountains…
 Okay, at last!
 Let’s hurry!
 Well, hold on…
 Why?!
 If we don’t hurry, night will fall beforewe arrive at Orochimaru’s hideout…
 That’s right!
 Sasuke is just a stone’s throw away!Pervy Sage!
 If we’re going to save him,we should do it as soon as possible!
 Why do we have to wait?!
 Huh…?
 What?
 Gee…
 Well…I’m hungry, you see…
 You know… All Shinobi must …
 I can’t fight if I’m hungry!
 Up ahead will become full-blownenemy territory.
 We won’t have time tohave relaxed meals, so…
 Okay, you guys eat, too! Eat!
 Mm, this is good…
 You prepared this especially for us?
 No. It seems the prettiest girlin the bar fell to my charm, you see.
 She made these with tender loving care.
 I’ll go make some tea.
 Oh…thanks…
 Tastes pretty good.
 Tea is ready.
 Here you go!
 Here you go.
 Thanks…
 Here you go.
 Thank you, Sasame…
 Sasame, you should come hereand eat with us, too.
 Okay…
 Pervy Sage…What’s wrong…?!
 Naruto…!
 Sasame did it…
 Since it’s come to this, they’re ours.
 Your wound still hasn’t healed.
 Kagero, you wait here.
 No mistake…They’re Leaf Ninja.
 If we take care of the Leaf pursuers…
 Lord Orochimaru will surely acknowledgethe power of the Fuma Clan.
 Yeah…
 Let’s come back with good news.
 And with the heads ofthe Leaf Ninja as souvenirs!
 I finally found it!
 At first, I thought it was someonefrom the Hidden Leaf Village.
 But it’s Sasame, believe it or not…
 Kamikiri, Jigumo, Kagero…
 This is an odd reunion.
 Where’s Arashi?!He wasn’t with all you guys?!
 Arashi is serving near Lord Orochimaruand is spending his days training.
 Can I see Arashi?!
 If you’re also going to work togetherwith us for Lord Orochimaru,
 I’m sure you’ll be able to see him.
 How’d it go?
 You’ve done well.
 With this, I’ll be able to see Arashi, right?
 After we’ve finished them off!
 Why?! Weren’t we just supposed totake them to Lord Orochimaru
 for examination after capturing them?!
 We only need the headsfor the examination.
 No!
 These people… For my sake…!
 Move it!
 – Wha--?! 					– Huh?!
 What?!
 The Fuma numbing medicinedidn’t work!
 We knew about it all alongfrom the beginning!
 Sakura!
 Substitution…?!
 I leave Sasame to you!
 Leave her to me!
 Sasame… Hang in there!
 Why…? Why does Sasame haveto do something like this?!
 No, it’s not that she’s doing itagainst her will…!
 It’s something she wanted to do!
 Liar!
 It’s true…
 What…
 What should I do to be ableto see Arashi again?
 It’s not a difficult thing.
 You just have to put the lights out of thosewho infiltrated the Land of Rice Paddies.
 We have to kill them…?!
 We’ll take them back to Lord Orochimarufor examination.
 So we’re not going to kill, right?
 If we carry out that work,Lord Orochimaru will acknowledge us.
 Hanzaki says that Arashi and everyoneare being tricked by Orochimaru.
 He says that you’ll just be usedand thrown away…
 Hanzaki’s just a traitorwho abandoned the village.
 Will you believe what we say?
 Or will you believe what a traitor says?
 Lord Orochimaru will surely restoreour Fuma Clan…
 Sasame, although you’re still young,you’re also one of the Fuma.
 Assist in the restorationof our Fuma Clan…
 So you guys did trick Sasame!
 It’s all for the restorationof the Fuma Clan!
 You little!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Here I go!
 Wha--!
 U-zu-ma-ki…!
 Naruto Barrage!
 This is bad…!
 Rasengan!
 This is for Sasame.Prepare yourselves!
 Naruto!
 You’re…from before?!
 The Earth Style Jutsu userin question, huh?
 However, there’s no point to using thatArt in this rocky area.
 Indeed, the Ant Lion appears frominside the ground
 and the spreading of its wings underthe sunlight is
 but a momentary gleam.
 That’s when I die as Kagero!
 Be careful!
 What’s this…?
 Look! Naruto…
 Wha--?!
 U-Unbelievable!
 You were a woman…?!
 The clan will once again bein a place lit by the sunlight…
 Lord Orochimaru promised that…
 I’ll use this once-in-a-lifetime Artif it’s for the sake of that.
 Kagero's Ninja Art: Ephemera!
 Naruto! Come with me!
 Naruto!
 I-I feel like…I’ve seen this before…
 It’s Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu.
 I summoned the extraordinarilysturdy stomach of
 the Mount Myoboku’slwajuku Giant Toad.
 Stomach…?
 Yikes!
 It’s melting…
 If I didn’t do this,
 we wouldn’t have been able todefend ourselves from her Chakra.
 I believed…that the clanwould someday…
 I believed in that.
 Sh-She vanished.
 I’ve got to hand it to her.
 She probably put all of her lifeon the line
 and attempted to save her comrades…
 It’s unforgivable!
 Those guys… 					the Fuma Ninja…
 Their feelings toward the clanis the same as our feelings!
 Manipulating the Fuma’s desireto restore their clan…
 I’ll kick Orochimaru’s butt, no matter what!
 Wh-Where are we?
 Kagero…!
 You risked your life to save us?
 You idiot…
 Please…
 Please use your Medical Ninjutsuto save her.
 Our comrade doesn’t havelong to live!
 Put your hands to your chests and think.
 Think about what you weren’table to accomplish…okay?
 We risked our lives working for you…to help you, Lord Orochimaru.
 In order to restore the Fuma Clan!
 Please recognize our work!
 You’ll just have to atone foryour failure with your bodies.
 Lord Orochimaru!
 I’m sorry for the betrayal!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 That’s Orochimaru’s residence!
 It really is just like him to constructhis residence underground.
 Sasuke is somewhere insidethat residence, right?
 Sakura, let’s hurry!
 Right!
 Be careful!First Avenue of hell is up ahead!
 Will a devil appear,or will a snake appear?
 Heh! I’m looking forward to it!
 I’ll kick the butts of the deviland the snake.
 And I’ll save Sasuke and Arashi!

 You mean to say that only rookieswent after Sasuke?!
 It really couldn’t be helped…
 the situation inthe Village being how it is…
 And anyway…
 I’ve taken the minimallyrequired measures.
 Hey, hey!
 Your mission has alreadybeen assigned!
 Uh, I’m gonna go do an errandand will be back shortly…
 Don't worry.
 Geez…
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 It’s already been two dayssince Sasuke left the village…
 And Naruto and the others who went inpursuit haven’t come back either.
 And neither has Lee…
 I know. I’ve more or lessheard the whole story.
 I…believe in Naruto!
 I believe him, but if something wereto happen to Naruto and Sasuke…
 Sakura, you don’t need toworry about anything.
 Leave this to me.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 First of all, I want you guys tofan out in all directions
 in pursuit of Narutoand Sasuke’s scent.
 Naruto and Sasuke you said?
 Did something happento the two of them?
 I’ll explain later…Right now, time is of essence.
 Okay.
 As soon as you confirm thatyou’ve detected the scent,
 call me and I’ll be there immediately.
 All right! Scatter!
 Well, I guess since she saw themfight before her very eyes…
 it’s useless to tell hernot to worry.
 Stop!
 Damn…
 I can’t stop…
 Sasuke… Stop with revenge.
 What?!
 Even if you were successfulin carrying out your revenge,
 all that will come out of itis a sense of emptiness.
 Shut up!
 What do you know?!
 Don’t say that so knowingly!
 Well…calm down.
 Neither you nor I couldcall ourselves lucky.
 Of that much I'm certain.
 But it could be worse.
 Both you and I have foundprecious comrades, right?
 We understand that all the morebecause we’ve lost them once.
 I taught you Chidori
 because you now haveprecious people.
 That power isn’t something to be usedagainst your comrades or for revenge.
 You know what that powershould be used for.
 I’m gonna win no matter what!
 Don’t get so carried away!
 I was too naïve…
 Watching them, they might actuallybe intent on killing each other…
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Please let me get therein time!
 I already said this earlier but…
 In truth, you were waitingfor this too, weren’t you?
 Neither Kakashi nor Sakuraare present right now.
 So there’s nobody here to stop uslike that time before.
 You…!
 This time around we’re gonnasettle this for real!
 I will take you down!
 Chidori!
 You idiot…
 Same here!I’m gonna clobber you…
 and take you back home evenif I have to drag you!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 It wasn’t meaningless…
 To me, you becamemy closest friend.
 Sasuke actually came outand said that…to me…
 And that’s exactly the reason whyI wanted to verify it using this Rasengan.
 Damn…
 Damn you!
 Damn…
 He was able to counter
 my full power of Chidorito that extent…
 That jutsu…
 Damn…
 Naruto, to what extent…!
 That loser…
 Naruto…!
 Well, your limit is two blows…that’s about it.
 And if I try to use more than that…
 what will happen?
 The third blow won’t initiate.
 Remember that well.
 If you try to initiatethe Jutsu forcibly…
 not only will the Art notinitiate properly,
 but your Chakra will become zero…
 In the worst case scenarioit will cost you your life!
 Damn… I can’t waste a blow…
 It wouldn’t serve any purposeif we cancel each other like earlier.
 There’s…no longerany mistake about this.
 You…really intended…
 You really intended to…
 Sasuke…!
 I will use numerous speedy techniquesand Jutsu to create an opening.
 And then…I will makea hit with Chidori.
 Sasuke…
 Did you know, Naruto…
 Top-class Ninja should beable to read each other‘s hearts
 simply by an exchange of fists.
 Even without saying anything…
 You’re naïve, Naruto.
 How about it?
 Were you really ableto read inside…
 this heart of mine?
 Fire Style:Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 Sasuke… I knew that youwere always alone.
 At first, I was relievedwhen I found out
 that there wasa guy similar to myself.
 And it also made me happy…
 To tell the truth, I really wantedto approach you right away.
 But…I wasn’t able to approach you…
 – Awesome…– You’re incredible…
 You were always ableto do everything.
 And moreover, you were alwaysbeing praised by everyone.
 Because you and Iwere so different…
 Because I didn’t want to admit it,I decided to call you my rival.
 I didn’t want to lose to you…
 and I felt that even more strongly…
 because I was called a loser.
 Even when we werein the Squad Seven,
 I continued to feelthe same way the whole time.
 I’m stubborn…
 And wasn’t able to expresswhat I really felt…
 What I really wanted wasto become like you.
 You were what I aspired to…so…
 You are one of the onesI want to fight.
 I was really happy whenyou said that!
 Those were your first words…acknowledging me…
 You and I both knew,
 without us even having tohave an exchange of fists!
 From that time on…
 Even without saying anything…
 The fact that…
 we are friends!
 It’s not without meaning…
 To me you’re…
 my closest friend.
 However…you’re trying totake me down for real.
 Right now, I don’t really know
 whether you really meantwhat you said earlier or not.
 Thinking that we were friends…
 That might have been…
 That might have been just me…
 It’s too late now!
 Naruto!
 If that’s the case…I’m…
 really lame, aren’t I…
 Sasuke!
 But…
 It can’t be helped, can it?
 I don’t know why but…
 I don’t know why…
 But I…
 I…
 don't want you…
 you to be taken awayby someone like Orochimaru!
 You managed to divert itwith your left hand,
 but it was meaningless.
 You won't be able to useany hand sign
 or that Jutsu earlier anymore.
 This is the end!
 Wh-What’s…
 that red Chakra…?
 Where does he get thatkind of power from?!
 W-What the heck…is this?!
 His shoulder injury is healing…
 That’s unbelievable!
 Sasuke! I’m not gonna letOrochimaru take you away!
 I will stop you,
 even if I have to break every bonein your arms and legs!

125,"Connecting old wordsthat have been used up
 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 The smell is moving away…
 I’m saved…
 Who is?
 Please wait!
 The real deal…starts now!
 My role now is to stall this personas long as possible…
 so, I should’ve avoided big techniquesthat could be self-defeating…
 But it seems this isn’t an opponenteasy enough to beat
 without using my Secret Technique…
 Here I go!
 I just had surgeryand am not at my best…
 But if it’d just be opening the first of theEight Inner Gates, the Gate of Opening,
 I should somehow…
 The first gate… The Gate of Opening…
 Open!
 Primary Lotus!
 The impact of the kickwas suppressed by the bones…?!
 That’s some speed… But it’s over.
 Damn it… No matter how much I think,I can’t come up with any good strategies…!
 I’ve had it…can’t hold any further…
 With me right in front of you,you can’t even howl like a loser…?
 Huh?!
 Die!
 You’re mine!
 Don’t you be smilingbefore you’re going to die!
 What?!
 Who’re you?!
 It seems you’re an ally this time…
 Who’re you?!
 A Sand…
 Shinobi…
 ally of the Leaf!
 The Sand Shinobi:Allies of the Leaf
 The Sand…?! Am I still drunk…?
 Gaara of the Desert…
 Gaara.
 Is that who you are?
 Digital Shrapnel!
 Did he blow the finger tip bones…?!
 Impetuous…
 You…
 When you fought me…you had more speed and sharpness.
 Easy to say…
 It’s not that I’m holding a grudge…
 But on account of you,I had kind of a tough time of it.
 I see…
 But…why you…?
 I owe a lot…
 to the Leaf.
 Sasuke!
 I heard that we’d made upwith the Sand traitors…
 But to think you’d changethis abruptly…
 It’s not like we attacked the Leaffor the fun of it…
 It was an order…
 In the same waythat I’m here now.
 I see. The Fifth Hokageasked the Sand…
 It’s a big help.
 By the way…has your sharpness gotten worse?
 Huh?
 Are you going to give up againor something?
 This time, I’ll do it for you!
 Sorry, but I can’t give up.
 A man mustn’t be protectedby a woman, so…
 As usual, you’re a guy who’s annoyingwith the man-and-woman stuff.
 Even if you act tough, it’s totally obviousthat it’s bravado, you idiot!
 This time you’re taking sideswith the Leaf, huh?!
 You guys sure are busyall over the place!
 She uses Genjutsuwith the sound of her flute.
 Right!
 Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!
 Blowing away the sounds of the flute
 and being able to nail the opponentwith a physical attack.
 To think she can attack and defendwith one hand…
 Unlike me, she has a nice Jutsu.
 That woman’s a natural enemy to me!
 Has Ukon…just about caught himaccording to the strategy?
 Puppet, huh…?
 You three had been approachingtogether, right?
 Two went on ahead.
 You guys are weak, so…
 You idiot… These guys areout of the ordinary!
 Behind you!
 I can’t…move.
 What’s this guy?
 I leave this to you, Sakon! Do it!
 Where’s the other one?
 Hey! Who are you looking for?
 That state… I know!
 Be careful!They enter the body and start to fuse!
 It’s too late.
 This guy!
 What’s the matter, Sakon?!
 It seems like…
 your Jutsu didn’t work…on the puppet.
 This is a puppet, too?!
 Let me tell you this.
 We, the Sand Ninja,aren’t as lax as the Leaf.
 Moreover, don’t be carelesslyapproaching…
 the Black Ant!
 He was fearsomewhen he was an enemy...
 But to think he’d be this dependablewhen becoming an ally.
 Ow… I got careless.Let me rest in your body for a bit.
 Good-for-nothing guy…
 Who are these guys?
 This is their ability!
 Although you were caught off guard…
 you getting hammeredby that puppet play…
 Well…
 Its power and speedare nothing special.
 I won’t be beatenby the likes of such a toy.
 And I was ableto heal my belly wound.
 I don’t have much Chakra left…but well,
 these are opponents I should be ableto tear apart, nevertheless.
 Indeed, it seems he’s healed.What a recovery ability he’s got.
 Ordinarily, I’m not the onewho becomes the main body,
 so it’s hard to move, damn it.
 You sure are mocking us…
 He’s not an opponentyou can beat fighting head on!
 We should retreat for now and…
 We can’t back down after having beenmocked, you know.
 Don’t mess with me!
 The Black Ant isn’t a Mechanismfor attacking.
 Primarily, it’s just for capturing.
 And…Crow paired up with the Black Antis exclusively for attacking.
 Hey you! Let me out!
 Eat this!
 Puppet Show…
 Hey, let me out! Let me out!
 Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!
 The play is over.
 She hid, huh…?
 Or did she run away?
 No…That couldn’t be…
 I just got here.
 Briefly explain the present situation
 including an analysis of her abilityand battle style.
 First off, her fundamental tactic isensnaring her opponent in Genjutsu
 with the sound of her flute.
 And then she delivers physical attacksto that opening.
 Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!
 This is bad! Is this Genjutsu?
 I can’t move my body…!
 I believe this was your last hand, right?
 Unfortunately…this is reversed checkmate!
 You little rat!
 She’s a classic Genjutsu-styledistance range type.
 Most likely, she must’ve seen your Jutsuand figured out immediately
 that it wouldn’t mix wellwith her own Jutsu.
 And it’s two against one, too.
 She’ll never appear before us againuntil she casts her Genjutsu.
 Sound, huh…?
 Yeah…
 Genjutsu generally appealto the five senses of people…
 sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.
 The type that uses hearingis the most troublesome of them all.
 After she cleverly takes a distance on youand then hides…
 you have no idea where the Genjutsuwill be cast from or when.
 The idea is for us to already be castby the Genjutsu
 by the time we’ve figured out where she isby the sound of the flute…
 Ouch…
 In my opinion, we’re at anoverwhelming disadvantage.
 A battle with this type, essentially,wouldn’t even be worth talking about
 without sensor typeslike Kiba or Neji.
 At this rate, we’ll get pushed into a cornersooner or later.
 – We should just retreat…– Who asked for your opinion?!
 I told you to just explain the situation.
 Don’t misjudge my power…
 If she thinksshe’s hiding well from me…
 in a distance enough for the soundof her flute to reach…
 she’s naïve!
 Summoning: Blade Dance
 Cut!
 All right…
 I’ve made it this far.lt’s about time for my Genjutsu…
 Huh?
 How about it?
 It’s done.
 She’s sure…pushy.
 She’s scarier than my mom.
 Pretty good, huh?
 But well…
 I just have to be gratefulfor this time…huh?
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 I got careless earlier,but it won’t be like that now!
 Now, you please stand back.
 I’m grateful for the help,but his opponent will be me!
 Next, for sure,with my ultimate Lotus…!
 Hey, why are you moving forward?I’m his opponent!

 My body movementshave finally returned…
 Blood…
 Lady Tsunade!
 Say! Say! What’s happening?!
 Why’s Kabuto fightingwith Old Lady Tsunade?!
 Take a good look at the headband!
 He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.
 Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!
 That man is Orochimaru…
 Shizune, you take care ofthe guy with the glasses…
 I’ll take care of Orochimaru.
 Before that, I’d like to have Tsunadedo something about this body.
 The effects of that drugmight still last for awhile…
 There’s nothing thatI can do about it.
 What? Really?
 Geez. I guess it can’t be helped.
 I have no choicebut to fight in this condition.
 Tsunade… Rest your bodywith Recovery Ninjutsu.
 Then… What about me, me?
 You guard Tsunade togetherwith that pig.
 What?! I want to fight, too.Even I can--
 No, you won’t!
 Like that four-eyed kid said, right?
 You’re on a different level.
 The opponent is a Sannin like myself,
 and the man who killedthe Third Hokage.
 An eye for an eye…I’m the only one who can fight him.
 And that four-eyed guy possessesthe same level of power as Kakashi.
 Okay.
 Then… Shadow Clo--
 Hold it!
 Don’t use the Shadow Clone Jutsu.lt’d be utterly pointless.
 What?
 It wouldn’t even becomemuch of a diversion…
 It’d be a waste of Chakra…
 with them as opponents.
 Now then, let’s get this thing started.
 – Summoning Jutsu.– Summoning Jutsu.
 Hi.
 – Huh?! 					– What is this?!
 – Wha--?!– What the heck’s going on?!
 Long time no see.
 On account of the drug,
 Master Jiraiya still can’t build upChakra very well.
 It looks like your stupidstill hasn’t healed, eh, Jiraiya.
 That’s too much even for youwith no ability.
 It seems Tsunade got youwith something.
 A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu,
 so perhaps she was thinking aheadand drugged him
 with something thatwould contain his power.
 To think she’d makea sacrifice of Jiraiya…
 Well, it sounds just like Tsunade.
 To think I’d already havemy handicap spotted.
 You are sucha disgraceful guy as always…
 Dang it. It kind of ticks me offwhen the Pervy Sage is mocked.
 Summoning…Jutsu!
 The Nine-Tailed Fox kidfrom the Chunin Exam.
 I wonder if I should’ve killed him then,after all.
 For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,
 I acknowledged his achievement…and let him slide by.
 But the only ones who can breaka Five-Pronged Spell
 are the Sannin membersand the Third Hokage.
 Which means Jiraiya may havealready taught it to Naruto.
 Perhaps.
 If he’s able to controlthe Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…
 Oh…
 Th-This is…
 It doesn’t quite look to be so.
 He isn’t endowed with Shinobi abilityto begin with, so…
 Why?
 He’s still got a long way to go,sure enough.
 Why?!
 Hello.
 Hey, Gamatatsu.Why did you come out?
 Oh, Brother Gamakichi.
 It’s the first time I’ve been Summoned.
 I-I wonder if I can do my best?
 Idiot. Get some snacksor something and hide.
 What? I can get snacks?Goody-goody.
 Here I go.
 I’ll take Jiraiya.
 I leave the rest to you.
 It’s unfortunate…
 Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya,one of the Sannin.
 Naruto!
 Your opponent is me.
 Earth Style! Dark Swamp!
 Dang it. I can’t completely sink themwith such a puny swamp.
 The drug is still working.
 But…with this, the snakes can’t move.
 Ninja Art! Poison Fog!
 I’ll be up a creek ifI take even one breath.
 My leg tendons…!
 I won’t be eaten twice…!No way!
 Here I go.
 Ninja Art! Needle Jizo!
 Dang it…The Jutsu isn’t working well.
 Even if we both have handicaps,you won’t one-up me…
 Give up now.
 It’s unfortunate…
 Here I had respected youas a fellow Medical Ninja.
 Stop. Stay back!
 Please hang on, Lady Tsunade…
 The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaruis also called, will cry.
 My body’s heavy.
 To think you who wereonce called the village madness
 would ferry around such a kidand struggle tirelessly for the village.
 You’ve really fallen, haven’t you?
 I have a keen eye to discern ability.
 And that kid…is mediocrity in my eyes.
 It’s precisely for this reason…that I don’t need the Uchiha kid.
 It’s no fun raising a geniuswho’s good from the start.
 So you can’t leave him alone
 because it’s like you’re lookingat your old self?
 That kid can’t beat Uchiha who inheritedthe inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill.
 And that’s because Narutodoesn’t possess the Sharingan.
 Shinobi ability is about whether
 one can use and masterall the Jutsu of the world.
 Ninja refers to onewho can use Ninjutsu.
 Shinobi ability is no such thing.
 You still don’t get it?
 A Ninja…is one who endures.
 It’s a difference of opinion, huh.
 I’ll teach you one thing.
 What’s most important for Shinobi ability…
 isn’t the number of Jutsuone possesses.
 What’s important is…
 The mettle…
 not to give up.
 Enough already…you jerk!
 The mettle to never give up…
 He possesses that.
 Heh. I don’t know what Jutsu you learned,
 but you can’t hit me withsuch a large motion.
 No good.
 It won’t easily hit witha moving opponent.
 Owwee!
 And the Chakra isn’tcompletely held, yet…
 It seems you got a cracked thigh bonein your left leg
 from the battle with the snake.
 Well, you can still move ifit’s just the bone.
 But it’s impossible now…
 The lateral vastus musclein your right leg is totally cut off.
 What should I do…?
 That Jutsu of mine uses both hands.
 If even one arm is taken out, it’s over.
 Are you scared of me?
 Do you want to run away from here?
 Naruto, as I recall,
 you whooped it up like thisduring the first Chunin Exam.
 Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away!
 ""Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away.""
 ""I’ll take it. Even if I’m a Genin for life…""
 ""I’ll become the Hokage at any cost,so it’s okay with me.""
 ""I’m not scared.""
 Can you…whoop it up in the same way now?
 Unlike you…
 I will be the heir to the Hokage nameno matter what!
 – Hokage is my dream!– Hokage is my dream!
 You’re not a kid anymore,so you should stop whooping it up…
 Depending on the situation,
 when you want to give up and run away,you should run away.
 Oh my… What’s with that look?
 You’ll die! If you die,there are no dreams or anything…
 Do you want to die?
 You’re still a Genin,so you should run away on the battlefield.
 Don’t tell a man to run away.
 Kids think that everything is easy.
 That’s why they talk about foolish dreamslike nothing at all.
 That’s why they can’t give up.
 Jiraiya, was it youwho taught him that Rasengan?
 Are you acting like a teacher by teachinga Jutsu that can’t be learned?
 Don’t give him false hopes.
 That’s why a moony kid starts jokingthat he’ll become the Hokage!
 They chase after foolish dreams…and then die.
 If I have three days,I’ll master that Jutsu.
 Then let's make a bet.
 Bastard!
 As for me… I stand by my words.
 That’s…my Way of Ninja!
 A bet?
 I’ll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 I’ll acknowledge thatyou’ll be able to become the Hokage…
 and give you this necklace.
 You should’ve juststayed out of this…
 Why?
 Why?!
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 You’re still going to get up?
 Just like our wager
 I will definitely winthat unlucky necklace from you.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone won’t do anything now.
 Enough… Don’t protect me, Naruto.Stop it!
 I told you that you’d dieif you were obstinate like that, right?
 If you die, there will be no dreams,no nothing.
 Just get out of the way. Run away.
 Humph… It’s okay.
 I…
 I absolutely will not die…
 until I become the Hokage!
 This way, I can hold on to you.Here I go!
 It’s the same Chakra movementas before.
 No, this is…different.
 I see.
 In order to gain a handfor suppressing Chakra,
 the Shadow Clone…
 Compress Chakra and…
 hold it completely.
 Wha--?!
 I-It can’t be.
 Rasengan!
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 I never forget my ideal…
 to develop the Village Hidden in the Leafand protect its people.
 The Hokages have sacrificedtheir lives for that dream.
 And now,I also will put my life on the line.
 From this moment,I am the Fifth Hokage!
 Next time: ""The Fifth Hokage!A Life on the Line!""

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days

 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 Yeah.
 So what do we do?
 We’ll decide on a password.
 Password?
 I’ll only say it once so listen closely.
 You ask Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.”
 And the answer is this:
 “It is a chance to sneak up where a large number of enemies are making a scene.
 “The quiet place hasno secret hideout.
 “It is important fora Shinobi to know the right time.
 “The time when an enemyis tired and drops his guard.”
 That’s it.
 H-Huge!
 T-Tail!
 You want our Earth Scroll, don’t you?
 Well, let's begin...

 I’ll make it to do so at any cost!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 I can’t move!
 I wanted you to entertain me more.
 It’s too bad.
 Move!
 He wiped out the fear with pain.
 As expected,he’s not the average prey.
 Don’t come near me!
 Don’t lower your guard,not even for a moment…
 A prey must always stay tenseand flee desperately
 before a predator!
 Sorry Sasuke.
 Naruto!
 The password… I forgot it!
 Naruto's Counterattack:Never Give In!
 The password... I forgot it!
 That’s all right, Naruto!
 Awesome!
 Naruto!
 I know you tried to be cool andintended to rescue us, but…
 Don’t put your nose in this!
 Escape!
 This thing…She’s on a far different level!
 Seems like you brought thatgiant snake down brilliantly, Naruto.
 No matter how you look,she looks like a snake…
 I get it, it was the handiworkof this woman.
 The situation has never gotten any betterwith him showing up for the rescue.
 But what should I do…?
 Hey hey hey! Evidently you’ve beenbullying the weakling!
 Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki is here,
 I’m going to wipe the floor with you!
 Darn it! If it continues like this,all three of us are done for!
 What should I do?
 Sasuke...
 It’s no good.
 This is the only way.
 Wait.
 Hmm?
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?
 If it’s the scroll you want,I’ll give it to you.
 I’m asking you.Just take this and go.
 Huh?!
 What?!
 Hey, Sasuke!What are you doing?
 Why are you givingour scroll to the enemy?
 You, shut up!
 What …?!
 I see… 					You’re sensible.
 The only thing the “prey” canhope for from the “predator” is
 presenting other food andpray you would be spared, isn’t it?
 Take it.
 Wha--?!
 You! Don’t interfere with this!
 Don’t you understand this situation?!
 What're you doing all of a sudden?!
 As for me, I don’t remember the password…
 So I got no way to make sure.
 But you, you’re an imposterSasuke,  aren’t you?
 Naruto!
 W-What are you trying to start?!
 You loser! 					I’m the real me!
 Liar.
 This, this stupid coward is... absolutely...not the Sasuke I know!
 I don’t know how strong she is but,
 how can you be sure that she’ll let usgo if we hand over the Scroll, huh?!
 You’re the one who choked anddoesn’t understand this situation!
 Naruto.
 That’s correct.
 The Scroll.
 I could just kill youand seize it.
 Don’t mess with me!
 Run, Naruto! Stop it!
 Darn it!
 I’ve lost confidence in you, Sasuke!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto!
 There are three corpses.
 This is some kind of Ninja Art,isn’t it… ?
 This is bad.
 We have a problem,from the get go.
 I’ll be darned.
 Inform Anko,the Proctor of the second test.
 Yes, sir!
 If you’re going to have dumplings,you’ve got to have sweet red bean soup.
 Okay...Once I’ve eaten this,
 I should break through andgo wait at the tower for the kids.
 With this program, the quick kidsshould clear it soon.
 The Leaf Village mark, perfect!

 Huh? What, so suddenly?
 Corpses! Three of them!
 Moreover, they’re strange.
 Anyway, please come!
 Strange?
 I checked their possessionsand identification,
 Ninjas from Grass Villageregistered in the Chunin Exam, but…
 As you can see...
 They have no faces.
 Yes.
 They’re smooth and flat,like they melted away.

 Yes!

 I’ll return… the Kunai knife.
 Thank you for your trouble.
 We’re in big trouble.
 Huh?!

 Yes!

 Naruto!
 Hey!
 Are you hurt...
 Scaredy cat?
 Sasuke!
 This stupid coward is absolutelynot the Sasuke I know!
 Huh?!
 Darn it! 					Let me go!
 You stupid snake!
 To think that thenine-tailed brat lived…
 When you get excited, a bitof the nine-tail’s power trickles out…
 You’ve grown up interesting.
 Look…
 The Seal is appearing onyour skin like a tattoo.
 Five-Pronged…Sealing!
 Sasuke! Help Naruto!
 Twelve years since the seal…
 Naruto’s Chakras and the nine-tail’sChakras are beginning to act in synch…
 But  now... you’re in the way.
 He’s gonna fall as it is!
 Naruto!
 What happened Sasuke?!
 Sasuke…
 Naruto’s certainly differentfrom you, Sasuke.
 He’s a klutz andkind of gets in the way.
 But he’s not in the least a coward!
 Right? 					lsn’t that right?
 You foolish little brother.
 If you want to kill me,resent me, hate me and…
 continue to live your ugly life.
 Flee.
 Flee and hang on to your life.
 No!
 Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan…his blood has begun to stir…
 Sasuke!
 I should take my time andconfirm his true power.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 I'm an avenger.
 To defeat my brother,today I have to survive!
 But how can a person who won't riskhis life in a situation like this
 beat my brother?
 Calm down, you should be able to see.
 There should be some wayto intercept her movements.

 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 Where’s the other one?
 Hey…
 Who are you looking for?
 I’ll take care of the rest.Go wash your eyes in that river.
 This is my ability…specializing in assassination, of course.
 You can’t beat me by just havinga good nose and nails…
 You can’t beat my ability!
 Akamaru… I’m sorry…
 Akamaru…We’ve always done things together.
 We were togetherwhenever and wherever.
 However this one time, I’m sunk.
 My cells can swim insideyour body as I wish,
 and I can even create partsthat are only you.
 In other words,a little bit of a fusion condition…
 a sharing of the flesh is what it’ll be.
 A sharing…?
 That’s right!
 And a cruel way of killingthat only I can accomplish…
 the gradual scraping offof just your cells!
 I see…
 If that’s the case…!
 If I do this…what’s gonna happen?
 Suicide?! That’s ridiculous!
 Die with me…
 To Each His Own Battle
 What are you thinking?!
 It’s just as I thought…We are sharing one body, right?
 Damn it!
 Entering my opponent’s bodyto avoid any attacks…
 that is my Jutsu’s greatest advantage.
 There hasn’t beena single one before now
 who’s done this sort of thing.
 Are you in pain?
 All right then, let’s get comfortable now.
 Yikes, you idiot! 					Stop it!
 It’s too late!
 There’s not enough blood…
 Damn!
 Damn…
 Where’d he go?
 So he left his little dog behindand fled.
 It’s the right decision,but he’s more cold-hearted than me.
 What?!
 It couldn’t be!
 What a relief…He’s still breathing.
 What a relief!
 Akamaru… You really gave it your best.
 Because of you, I was able to hold upthe enemy for a while.
 We’ve caused injuriesupon the enemy too.
 It’s enough… You’ve done enough.
 His name is Akamaru.
 Huh?
 Mom… Sis…
 From today, you’ll take care of him…Okay?
 I will?
 I’m Kiba. Nice to meet you, Akamaru.
 You!
 We’ve been together forever.
 Nice catch, Akamaru!
 All right, you did well!
 Here we go!
 Be more serious about it!
 Stop being such a baby!
 Mom…
 Listen, Kiba…
 It’s not just you.
 Akamaru and you,
 the two of you needto become strong together.
 With Akamaru… Together?
 Akamaru…
 That’s right.
 Way to go Akamaru! You did it!
 Mid-air Dynamic Marking!
 Next is mid-air triple somersault!Take your aim!
 Yahoo!
 Yahoo!
 We’ll be together foreverfrom now on too…
 I’ll protect you from now on!
 That jerk!
 Setting up a trap on me!
 I’ll kill you!
 Hey! Sakon! Where are you?! Sakon!
 Sakon!
 Sakon!
 Blah blah blah.You’re such a nuisance, Big Brother.
 Your yelling stings my eyes…
 Big Brother!
 I’ll kill him… is what I’d like to do,
 but it’s almost time for my sleep.
 Capture those bastards alive in my place.
 When I wake up,I’ll kill them.
 All right, Sakon?Capture them alive…
 Yeah, I got it…
 But…
 The killing part,we’ll do it together.
 If I carelessly attack,
 he dodgesand I end up attacking myself!
 Behold!
 Willow Dance!
 You!
 Bones?
 This is my…Kekkei Genkai.
 What’s with this guy…?
 Is he attacking with bones sticking outfrom all over his body?
 He’s grabbed his own bone!
 It’ll be soon…
 He’s turning the bone…into a sword!
 It’s futile. It’s not just ordinary bone.
 The highest density bone is hard as steel.
 So what?! I’ll break that bone!
 I possess Five Dances.
 You’d better not thinkyou know my strength after just this much.
 What?!
 I’ll specially show you…
 the Camellia Dance next .
 Come!
 I’ll crush you!
 I did it!
 It’s a Substitution?!
 There!
 Damn!
 They’re getting closer and closer.
 Damn!
 This isn’t good, traces of blood!
 Damn, I did save Akamarufor the time being,
 but maybe I went too far.
 This smell…What does it mean?
 Why… Why is it that even those guysare headed to a place like this?!
 I don’t understand anymore.
 In any case,we need to leave this place quickly.
 I can’t…
 I’m starting to feel light-headedfrom the pain and loss of blood…
 My body won’t move at all either…
 Akamaru…
 He left just his coat…
 Huh?
 So he fled by floating down the river…
 Damn!
 Damn!
 Damn…
 This is it!
 So, I’ve cornered you, you stinking rat!
 Pretty impressive…
 You timed it well to scatterthe three to attack.
 You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?
 Since it’s a pretty complicated song…
 Well now…
 Not only did youimmediately understand
 that I’m manipulating these guyswith my flute,
 you understood how difficult this song is.You’re a pretty impressive punk.
 But you can’t completelyunderstand this song.
 You're so right…since art is so foreign to me.
 But since she uses that fluteto manipulate,
 it means that song must containindividually specific sound patterns
 to control each and every movementof those guys.
 I’m pretty confidentwhen it comes to just analyzing,
 but this time it’s not looking good.
 The reason is that
 I don’t understandmusical notes whatsoever.
 There’s no one that’s heardthis song and lived.

 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad

 The last time was Walk-on-Water Jutsu,so is it gonna be Walk-on-Fire Jutsu?
 Or maybe Walk-in-the-Air?
 Hurry up and tell me, Pervy Sage!
 You keep calling me Pervy Sage.
 So you have no idea thatI’m a superb person, huh?
 Huh…? A superb Pervy Sage?
 Nhaagh… Listen carefully!
 Toad Sage is only a disguise!
 As a matter of fact…!
 North and South and East and West!
 I’m the white-maned toad charmer,
 and one of the legendary Sannin whomeven celestial beings can’t defeat.
 Such a stud!
 That he strikes fear…in the hearts of people!
 I am no other than “Master Jiraiya”!
 Yes… 					I’m talking about me!
 Huh…
 Jiraiya:Naruto's Potential Disaster
 Atafuku Town?That’s ten kilometers from here!
 It’s “O”tafuku Town!
 Hey…hey… 					Hey, Pervy Sage!
 I’m telling you, it’s Jiraiya.Gimme a break…
 So the fact that sucha bigwig Pervy Sage like you
 is taking me along ashis travel companion means…
 that I’m potentially a genius?
 Just as I thought!
 Hey! Hey! Hey!Why did you choose me?
 A long time ago,the Fourth Hokage was my disciple.
 And you resemble the Fourth Hokageso much, it’s almost funny.
 That’s the only reason…
 I…?
 The Fourth Hokage…?
 Yeah!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 W-What is it?
 Yeah!
 The fact that I resemblethe Fourth Hokage means
 that I also possess geniusof his level, right?
 I’ll become the Hokage, after all!All right!
 W-Wait…
 I stepped on some dog poop!
 About the only areas you resemblethe Fourth Hokage
 are your hair and your stubbornness!
 What was that?!You senile Pervy Sage!
 Not again!
 Sakura? Come here!
 Okay!
 Please take these rice sweetsover to Ino’s house.
 Ino’s house?
 These?
 That’s right…
 Don’t bother themby staying too long.
 Because everyone isvery busy at this time.
 I know that!
 See you later!
 Oh, yeah…
 I’ll bring some overto Sasuke later on too.
 I wonder if he likes sweets…?
 And to Naruto too…
 Naruto looks likehe would eat anything…
 Hey Kakashi Sensei!Teach me Chidori too!
 You may say teach me,but it’s not that easy.
 What the heck’s that?!
 That’s not fair, show me how!Teach it to me.
 Sasuke… Thank you…
 You rescued me fromthe Sand Ninja, right?
 No…
 Huh?
 For a start, why don’t you try gatheringChakra in your palms!
 All right!
 The person who rescued you…was Naruto.
 Like this? Like this?
 Oh come on, Sasuke,you’re being overmodest again.
 It’s true that Naruto has gotten stronger,but against that Sand Ninja…
 I’m telling you the truth.
 That kid fought desperatelyto rescue you.
 He showed a kind of strength thathe had never shown before.
 Naruto rescued…me.
 Oh, it’s coming…
 Chidori! Huh? Chidori! Chidori!
 All right! I’ll bring some to Naruto too!
 I wasn’t…I wasn’t able to do anything…
 I don’t want to watch a precious comradedie right before my eyes ever again…
 No matter what,I will protect you!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto is getting stronger and stronger.
 Compared to him, I…
 While you may able tomanage against him,
 I couldn’t possibly…
 He’s in a completely different level…
 Yeah…
 If we go at each other,we’ll either both be killed or at best,
 kill each other simultaneously.
 Even if we increased the numbers,that wouldn’t change.
 I didn’t expect the kid’s guardwould be a legendary Sannin.
 With him as the opponent…
 the names of Leaf Village’s Uchiha Clan
 and the Seven Ninja Swordsmenof Mist would be tarnished.
 Yeah. However…
 Any strong one has a weakness…
 Stop! You will get cursed!
 Hey, hey, Pervy Sage…
 Huh?!
 What kind of a student wasthe Fourth Hokage?
 Well, I guess one could say
 that he developed to that extentbecause he was my student…
 You’re one lucky guyto be taught by me!
 – Hmmm… 					– Hmmm…
 Are you dubious?
 A good teacher will developgood disciples.
 That goes without saying.
 Then, then, who taught you,Pervy Sage?
 Me?
 I learned from the Third Hokage.
 The Third Hokage?
 That’s right…
 The Third Hokage wasstill young and lively.
 – The Third Hokage…young and lively?– The Third Hokage…young and lively?
 That’s right!I was young and lively too!
 Young and lively?!
 I…I got tangled up.
 See… You got cursed…
 So you learned from Kakashi.
 Then you experiencedthe “Bell Training,” right?
 Huh…?
 Yeah! I did! Yes I did!
 Only I was tied to the tree trunkand had one deuce of a time…
 What? You too?
 Huh? What do you meanby “you too”?
 Huh?
 What do you mean by “you too”?
 Why don’t you just hurry,get up and return those things.
 Even if you were to say that…it’s pretty difficult…
 There are two bells.
 The fact that there areonly two means…
 That one of us has to goto the tree trunk…
 You’re quick on the uptake, Orochimaru.
 All right! I’ll make it!
 Come at me with the intent to kill!
 Jiraiya, I won the bet with you, didn’t I?
 You got tied to the tree trunk,after all.
 Shut up!
 You flat-chested like a cutting board.
 What did you say?!You nerdy perv!
 Okay, Okay, that’s enough.
 Tsunade and Orochimaru go home!
 Okay!
 You are hopeless…
 Ninja shouldn’t be getting caught inobvious traps like that over and over again.
 But…
 Why don’t you learn a littlefrom Orochimaru?!
 Sarutobi Sensei, you’re alwayssaying Orochimaru, Orochimaru!
 Hm?
 When it comes to snooping,I’m really good at Transparency Jutsu.
 Gimme a break…
 I don’t even wanna know
 what level of Transparency Jutsuyou possess…
 I’ve never been caught once!And that’s the truth!
 If you’re that sure of yourself,I’ll go with you next time…
 You’re such a lecher, Sarutobi Sensei…
 Huh?! Huh?
 What, what?
 Hey!
 What’s so funny?! Pervy Sage!
 Huh?
 It’s just as I said, a good teacherwill develop good disciples.
 Huh…? I don’t understandwhat you’re saying!
 Come on, let’s go.Did you put it back properly?
 Yeah, I fixed them!
 See!
 It appears that they haven’tfound Naruto yet.
 But don’t you think that’s strange?
 Those guys had alreadyinfiltrated the village.
 It should be easy to find Narutoin this village.
 Itachi knows Naruto’s face.
 Kakashi…
 Why is Kakashi sleeping?
 Besides, only Jonin are gathering here…
 What are you doing?What in the world happened?!
 Nothing…in particular…
 Is it true that thatltachi has returned?!
 And moreover,that he’s after Naruto…?!
 Oh…
 Idiot…
 Why does this always happen?!
 So that guy returned to this village?And moreover, he’s pursuing Naruto?
 What does all this mean?!
 Sasuke?!
 Where’s Naruto?!
 Huh? I just got here too.
 I wanted to give Naruto…
 Some sweets…?
 If Naruto is caught by that guy,that will spell his end.
 I’m not gonna let him do that!
 Hey old man!Naruto must have come here!
 And do you knowwhere he went after that?
 Oh, Naruto, right…
 If I remember correctly…
 Master Jiraiya came herearound noon and…
 They ate ramen together,and he said he was going somewhere…
 Where?!
 Hmm…I think he said to a post stationsome distance from the village…
 And then he left with Master Jiraiya.
 Jiraiya?
 Jiraiya – one of the genius Sannin.
 Well, in appearance,
 he just looks likea big white-haired old man.
 Big and white-haired…
 H-Hey!
 Geez… If you’re gonnaask somebody a question,
 it’s only polite to stayand have a ramen or something.
 Candies are here.
 This town is pretty weird.
 Naruto!
 Huh?
 We’re staying here tonight!
 What?! I can still walk!
 A disciple should obey his master!
 I just want to learn the Jutsu!
 That’s what’s called a disciple!
 Huh?!
 Oh, oh…!
 Naruto!
 Yes?
 Here, this is the key to the room.
 Go to the room ahead of me,practice Chakra,
 train some and go to sleep!
 Got it?!
 What?!
 “The adult world is gonna beginfrom this point on”…
 Is that the vibe, Pervy Sage?!That’s not fair!
 That post town isn’t that far…!
 This! Somehow this always happenswhen I’m with that Pervy Sage!
 Darn…
 Here…
 Candies are here!
 I’ve got to check door by door!
 Cheers!
 I wonder if he really has any inclinationto oversee my training?
 What about that one? Yeah that.
 See! A hundred out of a hundred!
 Do you have a blond kid witha dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old manstaying here?
 This is an inn for women only…
 I’m looking for someone…
 Do you have a blond kid witha dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old manstaying here?
 Today, we only have old people.
 Hmm…this is kind of crispon the tongue…
 Hey, why are you guys all sleeping?
 Do you have a blond kid witha dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old manstaying here?
 White-haired…?
 Are they here?!
 Eh…Do I remember seeingsome people like that earlier
 when shifts changed…?
 This tastes bitter…are you all right with it? Cheers!
 Oh! A blond kid anda white-haired old man!
 They’re here?!What’s their room number!
 Um…
 Room number one atthe end of the hallway
 on the second floor…
 What’s up?Has she already dumped you?
 Okay, Okay!
 Okay, Okay, I’ll open up!
 Naruto!
 It’s not him…
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools
 Darn it! My body is frozen!What is this creepy feeling?
 This guy is absolutely notan ordinary person.
 He’s got the same Sharinganas Sasuke.
 He’s a member of Uchiha clan.

 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 It’s been a while sinceI’ve eaten Ichiraku ramen!
 Lately I’ve been awayfrom home on missions.
 The bowl of ramen aftera mission…
 it spreads to every muscle of the bodyand becomes energy for tomorrow.
 If you eat ramenit drives fatigue away.
 Ramen!
 Ramen!
 Ramen!
 Ramen!
 Temporarily closed…?
 No, it can’t be…
 I endured all the tough missions,looking forward to Ichiraku ramen…
 I can smell ramen!
 What?
 You're right!
 Without a doubt…Ramen is being made in there!
 Ramen!
 Mix it! Stretch it! Boil it up!Burn Copper Pot Burn!
 This smell…
 It’s the smell of a soup
 that’s never been onthe Ichiraku menu before.
 Then… It's temporarily closedto develop a new menu?
 Who’s there?!
 A large helping of miso char siu ramen!With an egg please.
 I see…
 You were looking forward tomy ramen that much.
 Sorry about that.
 It’s okay to develop a new menu,
 but I wish you’d do itafter the shop is closed.
 Since you came all this way.Give this a taste.
 Could this be…
 Ichiraku’s new menu?!
 Let’s eat!
 Wait a minute!
 There are rules when you’re eatinga new ramen for the first time…
 Rule ♪1!
 Before you do anything,
 you must first havea sip to taste the soup.
 – Delicious! 					– Delicious!
 Next, you have to coat the noodlesin soup and eat.
 Huh? It seems like somethingis missing…
 Let’s get to the point.
 The noodles are outdoneby the soup!
 This well-seasoned, rich soupgreatly surpasses
 any of Ichiraku’s previous soups!
 But! The noodles arethe same as always!
 The balance is very bad.
 I cannot give it a passing score!
 That’s what I thought…
 Oh… Don’t get so depressed…
 Ayame, water! Water please!
 Huh? Where’s Ayame?
 With ramen like this…
 I’ll never be able to get Ayameback from the Ryonin.
 Teuchi!
 He’s just overtired.
 I had him drink an energy drink,so after a little rest he'll recover.
 But… I think he should take a breakfrom the shop for a while.
 He’s been using his armstoo much…
 Look how swollen this is.
 Come to think of it,before he fell,
 he said something about Ryoninor whatever
 did something to Ayame, I think…
 Ayame is his daughter, right?
 What’s Ryonin?
 I don’t know…
 Ryonin…He’s referring to the Ninja Chef.
 Ninja Chef?
 Do you know about them, Choji?
 I’ve heard rumors about them…

 but the main role of thoseare to supply nutrients.
 They have no taste.
 If they could eat delicious foodwhile on missions,
 would the success rateof missions rise?
 Based on that theory,was born…
 The Ninja Chef… Ryonin!
 But what those Ninja Chefhave to do with Ayame?
 They snatched her away…
 What?!
 What are you talking about?!
 Give us the details!
 It was two weeks ago…
 Ichiraku Ramen
 Welcome!
 The large serving,here’s your order!
 A good job as always, Teuchi!
 Hakkaku!
 His name is Hakkaku,
 long ago we trained atthe same ramen shop…
 He told me he is a Ninja Chef,a Ryonin, these days.
 Actually… I have a favor to ask you.
 What is it? If it’s something I can do,I'll cooperate.
 The phantom recipe thatI heard you developed…
 Please turn it over to me!
 Ph-Phantom recipe?What are you talking about?
 To a chef, a recipe ismore precious than life!
 I understand whyyou want to hide it!
 But… please! Give it to me!
 I really had no clue.
 But Hakkaku didn’t believe me…
 Ayame. Let’s get to workopening the shop…
 What the… What’s this tray?
 Ayame!
 I have your daughter.
 If you want her back,hand over the “phantom recipe!”
 Damn that Hakkaku!
 Why didn’t you contactthe Hokage right away!
 The Hokage could…
 If I did that, I don’t know whatwould happen to Ayame.
 And he also wrote thisin the letter…
 That if I can serve themsomething impressive,
 he’ll give up on the phantom recipeand return my daughter safe.
 But, you've got a way to win?
 I don’t know.
 But a chef’s challenged meto a cooking match.
 I have no choice but to do it.
 So that’s why you’re developingnew ramen.
 I was able to make the soupexactly how I wanted to.
 But…I just can't get the firm noodlesthat go with the soup…
 I can’t get Ayame back like this!
 The cooking match is tomorrow…What am I going to do?
 I can’t imagine an Ichirakuwithout Ayame.
 Okay! Teuchi! We’ll help you.
 We’ll make the best ramen…
 And get Ayame back…
 From the Ryonin!
 You guys…
 I'll teach you the basicsof making noodles.
 Quickly mix the ingredients evenly.
 If there are discrepancies,
 there will be variations inthe taste of the noodles.
 Next… Knead it.
 If you don’t put this properlythe noodles won’t be firm.
 Are you okay?
 It's nothing. Don’t worry about me.
 And…stretch the noodles!
 It’s important for them to beof a uniform thickness!
 So there will be no differencesafter boiling…
 Try it.
 It’s easy to say it…
 but to actually make the noodlesis not so easy.
 It takes five years to becomean accomplished chef in his own right.
 To do it by the match tomorrowis completely…
 When it comes down to it,
 I’ll have to give up this decrepit bodyof mine to them.
 Teuchi…
 You’re not thinking aboutwhen you lose, are you?
 Th-That’s…
 Because if we are doing this,
 we’re doing it with the intentionof winning, believe it!
 I absolutely don't forgive peoplewho hold a girl captive!
 Cooking comes from the heart.
 Technique and experiencearen’t everything!
 No problem…
 We’ll show them the real strengthof the Shinobi of Leaf Village!
 Sorry to make you wait, Hakkaku!
 The phantom recipe?
 You can’t tell by looking at me?
 I see. How foolish…
 Let me tell you,
 ramen like the stuff I ate atyour shop the other day can't win.
 Is Ayame okay?
 Father!
 Ayame!
 The emotional reunion comesafter the match.
 I have a favor to ask.Let me have some helpers.
 I don’t think those kids are upto the task, but…
 Well… That’s okay.
 Well, let’s start the cooking match!
 Let’s see if you can satisfyall of us Ninja Chef!
 There are so many of them…
 We don’t have time to stand around…Let’s begin!
 The preparation for the soupis done!
 I’ll prepare the ingredientsfor the rest!
 I’m leaving the noodles to you!
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Listen. Our noodles determinewhether Ayame will return or not!
 We cannot fail!
 Seems like he’s done a good jobwith the soup…
 The delicious aroma iswafting over here.
 Indeed, it’s whetting my appetite.
 The noodles are the problem!
 Can those kids really make noodles thatwill go with that soup?
 First, mix the ingredients!
 They’re amateurs,I thought so!
 You can’t make decent noodleswith that hand movement!
 We practiced making noodlesall night!
 But, we didn’t make the noodleswe wanted to by morning…
 Even so, we have tomake perfect noodles!
 Hey hey. At least make ussomething edible!
 Quickly…
 Uniformly…
 Without discrepancies!
 Next, knead it!
 Hey, Sakura!
 Look, it’s Kakashi Sensei.
 Don’t play!
 Oh…
 Sakura…
 Oww! Sakura, you just can’t controlyour own crazy strength!
 It’s your fault for playing aroundat a time like this!
 This is…
 This is…the last of the ingredients.
 No problem. This time, let usshow you we’ll succeed!
 Okay, I’m mixing.
 Wait Choji! Leave this to me!
 Naruto…
 Hey, Sakura…
 Huh?
 We are Shinobi, right?
 So then… Let’s show themthe Ninja way to make noodles!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengen! “Ichiraku” version!
 Wh-What?! Mixing ingredientswith Chakra?!
 No, that way he’ll surely be ableto mix the ingredients uniformly!
 And in micro units!
 Sakura!
 What?
 Pervy Sage.
 Naruto!
 Cha!
 Wh-What’s this crazy strength…?!
 If she does that,the noodles will become super firm!
 Okay, Sakura!
 Choji!
 I, too…am a Shinobi of Leaf Village!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu: Both Hands!
 What?!
 What outstanding noodles!
 If those noodles are added toTeuchi’s soup, this match would…
 W-We cannot lose!
 It’s for the future of the Ninja Chef!
 Now they just have to be boiled, Teuchi!
 Okay! Leave it to me!
 Wait a minute!
 When the ramen is done…
 Who will you serve it to first?
 Huh? Who…?
 Th-That’s right…That’s how it is!
 That’s how what is?
 Among the chefs…
 there’s a cardinal rulenot to be forgotten.
 The first guest to arrive isthe first guest served!
 No matter how deliciousthe food you make is…
 if you break this cardinal rule,you’re disqualified as a chef!
 True, if a guy who came laterwere eating before me,
 then it would seriously pisses me off.
 There are 100 Ninja Chefs here…
 They all showed up at aboutthe same time!
 So you have to serve ramento 100 people at the same time!
 You’re four people…
 Can you really serve atthe same time?
 I said we’re Ninja, didn’t I?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 What?!
 Now! Lift them!
 – Thanks for waiting. Here you go!– Thanks for waiting. Here you go!
 – Oh… 					– Oh…
 Th-The taste is the issue!lf you don’t satisfy us, you lose!
 Delicious!
 – Delicious! 					– Delicious!
 I’ve never had ramen this delicious.
 So then…
 We win!
 – We did it! 					– We did it!
 The truth is…
 We Ninja Chefs are atthe end of our rope…
 End of your rope?
 What do you mean by that?
 We endeavored to makedelicious meals to eat during missions…
 We thought to make delicious food,to fill your stomach…
 that can be eaten anywhere…
 But we pursued taste too far.
 It was too delicious, people werecompelled to overeat.
 And as a result…
 Ninja gained weight,and it interfered with their missions.
 And some people are now saying,
 “we don’t needthe Ninja Chefs anymore.”
 – Oh… 					– Oh…
 For us Ninja Chefsto continue,
 we had to get our hands onthe “phantom” recipe out there
 in the cooking world!
 Recipe?
 If we use this recipe,
 we can improve the performanceof Shinobi without causing a burden.
 There’s such recipe…?
 I hear, it’s called“the scum recipe.”
 – The scum recipe?!– The scum recipe?!
 We've gathered informationfrom everywhere…
 As a result,
 we learned that the scum recipewas at ""Ichiraku"" which Teuchi run.
 – What?! 					– What?!
 I-I don’t know!
 There’s no reason something like thatshould be at my shop!
 There’s someone who heard it!
 I've got ""the scum recipe""at my shop, so…
 Oh… Teuchi…?
 Oh. I might have that.
 Are you serious?!
 I thought so!
 To be precise…lt’s the “scum removal recipe.”
 – Scum removal?– Scum removal?
 The trick to making delicious soup…
 is how well youremove the scum.
 So I, too, studied a lot.
 Eventually, I worked out a recipethat can remove the scum effectively.
 Usually it's called“the scum recipe” for short…
 I never thought thatthis misunderstanding would arise.
 That’s a pretty big omission.
 Geez. That’s a stupid punch line…
 We won the cooking match,
 so keep your promiseand return Ayame!
 That’s right! Where is she?!
 Father!
 Aya…me?
 Ayame…is that you?
 Can’t you tell by looking?
 B-But Ayame is like…
 The food they make isso delicious, I overeat…
 Did I gain that much weight?
 Ayame!
 Ichiraku’s new menu?
 The thing we madeat the cooking challenge?
 No, a diet ramenthat’s popular among girls.
 Diet Ramen?
 It’s super popular!
 Oh, come on in, Naruto.
 You’ve regainedyour former shape…
 It’s thanks to my father’sdiet ramen!
 Huh? Where's your father?
 Well… While he was joining mein eating the diet ramen…
 Hey… Naruto.
 That’s a little too thin, believe it.
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Does anyone have anythingto ask about this mission?
 I’ve got a question!
 Why should I have to go ona mission with this group?
 Okay, let’s move on.Everyone ready?
 Hey, I’ve got a question, believe it!
 As for the mission details,
 we’re to eliminate the Demon of the Oceanin the Land of Oceans.
 You guys are going to getfired up for me
 since you came to serve under me!
 Just a minute.Hey, listen to me!
 Now, let’s get going!
 Stop complaining andjust come with me!
 Listen to me, I say.Listen! Listen! Listen!

204,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 The distance created between usbecame too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouthmakes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile,even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Please, Sensei!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Whoa, my heart, my heart!
 Huh? There's nothing wrong.
 Hey, it's you again.
 To think you'd transform into Kurenaiwith a Transformation Jutsu.
 Hey, what the heck was that earlier?
 Shut up! For your sake,don't be nosing around needlessly.
 Hey!
 You're Yakumo. Right?
 I want to ask you somethingabout Kurenai Sensei!
 D-Damn it!
 This is…the Academy's hallway.
 Sensei, please!
 Yakumo's Sealed Power
 Why am I no good?!
 Kurenai Sensei?
 I want to become a Ninja,no matter what!
 I must become one!
 I told you to give up.
 No!
 Then I’ll just have to performa Sealing Jutsu
 and seal your power.
 Huh?
 Huh?!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Why?!
 S-Sakura. Umm, where am I?!
 As for me,what am I doing lying here?!
 Oh yeah! Kurenai Senseigot stabbed
 and my heart leapt outof my chest and…
 No, that’s not it.Where’s that girl?
 Where’s Yakumo?
 It seems you don’t remember at all.
 You got caught breakinginto a mountain cottage
 under special security!
 Huh…?!
 The Anbu Black Ops are in action,
 so you should be thankfulyou’re alive!
 Oh yeah!
 The dream I just had…lt was strangely real.
 No doubt it was the girlin the mountain cottage!
 What’re you blabbing about?!
 I’ll inject you with a stimulantif you don’t knock it off.
 I can’t be doing stuff like this!
 Hold it!
 The medicine hasn’t worn off, yet!
 Sensei! Kurenai Sensei!
 Kurenai’s already gone out.
 What?!
 You’ve gone to the troubleof getting up early.
 So how about joining me foran early-morning marathon?
 This isn’t the time for that!
 Morning marathons are great!
 Marathons purge the sweatand impurities built up
 in your body from a night of sleep.
 More importantly,where did Kurenai Sensei go?!
 Come to think of it,
 she said something about goingto visit someone…
 Something about a student
 she took care of in the pastbeing in poor health…
 Huh? She went to see Yakumo!
 Then at least join me forsome morning exercise!
 Morning exercise purges the sweatand impurities built up
 in your body from a night of sleep…
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Whoa?!
 I have something I want to ask you,Kurenai Sensei.
 Naruto, don’t stick your noseinto my business any further.
 Yesterday I went to see Yakumo!
 I don’t know if it wason account of that,
 but I just had a strangely real dream!
 A dream…?
 Yeah.
 You said to Yakumo that you weregoing to use a Sealing Jutsu
 if she wouldn’t give upbecoming a Ninja…
 Sorry, but I’m in a hurry…
 H-Hey. Wait!
 It doesn’t concern you…
 Yes, it does!
 Hinata, Kiba and Shino areall troubled
 because you said you weregoing to quit!
 Doesn’t the fact thatyou’re quitting Squad Eight
 have something to do withthat girl Yakumo?!
 What you saw wasn’t just a dream…
 What…?!
 I used a Sealing Jutsu andtook away a student’s power!
 No way. That couldn’t be!
 It happened over a year ago…
 By my own hand,I crushed the dream of a girl…
 I tutored individually named Yakumo…
 who was trying to becomea practitioner of Genjutsu.
 No way!
 I don’t deserve to havethe lives of the Genin
 in Squad Eight entrusted to me.
 But why…?
 Now, get out of my way!
 That’s the end of this conversation.
 No way…But I still have stuff I want to ask you…!
 I have no choice.
 What's happening?!
 They won’t come off!
 Kurenai Sensei, that’s just cruel!
 We’re already surrounded…
 Make emergency contactwith the village…
 Yes, sir.
 There!
 What?!
 We’re counting on you!
 What?!
 Hurry…to the Hokage!
 Yakumo… Come with us.
 Geez, that Naruto.
 The least he could do is thank mefor attending to him all night.
 What?!
 Isn’t it about tea time?
 After you’ve taken care ofthese documents!
 Why’s there so much work?
 It’s because you didn’t take careof it lickety-split, Lady Tsunade.
 It’s a carrier pigeon foremergency contacts!
 What?!
 It’s from the mountain cottagein Satomi Hill…
 Something’s happened to Yakumo!
 There’s a possibility thata person being protected
 by the Village Hidden in Leaves,Yakumo Kurama, has been kidnapped.
 Head for the mountain cottage inSatomi Hill and secure Yakumo.
 Yakumo Kurama…
 As I recall, that’s the girl Kurenaitook custody of, right?
 Yes, the only daughter of Murakumoof the Kurama Clan head family.
 Umm, what’s the Kurama Clan?
 It’s natural that you guys wouldn’t know.
 They were a distinguished family
 that wielded considerable powerin the village,
 but they’re just a shadowof what they used to be.
 The death of Murakumoand his wife about a year ago
 became the catalyst for that.
 I hear that the clan fell apartafter that.
 Does the kidnapping of the onlydaughter of the head family mean
 that the Kurama Clan’sSecret Jutsu is being targeted?
 Well…
 According to the documents
 handed down fromthe Third Hokage,
 it seems her latent powers asa Genjutsu Ninja
 are extremely dangerous…
 In other words, she would makefor a powerful asset
 if those powers can be awakened.
 That means it wouldn’tbe surprising
 if there were guys seekingthat power, huh?
 After her parents died,
 she was kept underprotective custody in the village.
 All right. Leave it to me!
 I won’t allow a girl to cry!
 Might Guy,the Leaf Village's Handsome Devil
 will rescue her,no matter what!
 Sakura, you go with them as well.
 – What?! 					– Huh?
 Once we have her in custody,
 we’ll need someone to lookafter her condition.
 Only one with experience asa Medical Ninja can do this.
 Y-Yes ma’am!
 This mission is a chanceto show my master
 the fruits of my training!
 Ouch!
 Ouch? Did you trip on a tree rootor something?
 What’s this?!
 N-Naruto…!
 He fell asleep in a place like this?!
 Nice, Akamaru!
 Naruto…
 He’s…caught in a Genjutsu!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Release!
 What…? Sakura…
 Salty!
 What the hell is this?!I mean, was I asleep again?
 What’re you babbling about?!
 You were caught in a Genjutsu.
 Genjutsu…
 I was chasing after Kurenai Sensei
 who was heading forthe Satomi mountain cottage
 and I tried to get her to listen to me.
 Satomi mountain cottage,you say?
 Then Kurenai went alone?
 Yeah, probably.
 Kurenai’s in danger
 if she went without being awarewhat’s happening!
 Huh?
 Something’s strange…
 Someone’s here!
 Damn it. Was it a mistaketo come alone…?
 But I don’t have the timeto return to the village…
 They’re most likely after…Yakumo.
 What?!
 Oh no!
 Sorry, but I mustn’t allow youto interfere with our work.
 Wha--?!
 You think you caught me with that?
 What?!
 You’re the one who’s caught!
 The enemies are also practitionersof Genjutsu.
 I must not lose…
 What’s this presence?!
 They’re both caught in a Genjutsu.
 Yakumo… Is that you, Yakumo?
 So you were safe!
 Help me!
 It’s okay now, Yakumo.
 I’ll protect you, no matter what.
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Release!
 You were hit witha reverse Genjutsu, eh?
 I-I’m sorry.
 Just what I’d expect froma Jonin…
 No, I should probably say Kurenai Yuhi…
 Stay alert!
 We should consider ourselves
 as being under suspicionby the Leaf Village.
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 The two who took Yakumohaven’t returned…
 I guess somewhat violent actioncan’t be avoided.
 Although we come fromthe same village…
 we will get Yakumo,no matter what the cost.
 Understood?
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Oh!
 What is it, Hinata?!
 Did you see something?
 The mountain cottage isbeing attacked by someone.
 There are four out front and four insidethe mountain cottage.
 Are two of the people insidethe mountain cottage
 Kurenai and Yakumo?
 I bet that’s it!
 Kurenai Sensei,what the hell happened?!
 Tell us!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 I’m surprised…
 Who would’ve thought that
 the intruders would turn outto be you people.
 But whatever reasons you may have,I won’t let you take Yakumo!

 Even if you are experts in Genjutsu,
 I will protect this child withevery ounce of strength I have in my body.

 for some obscene magazineanyway, right?
 That kind of thing isn’t called work.
 It’s a mission to gather informationabout the Akatsuki Organization.
 But if I tell this guy that,
 he might ask me tolet him come.
 Humph!
 I’ll make it up to you by…
 Huh?
 W-What’s this?
 It’s so that you don’t get boredwhile you’re staying at home,
 it’s a special training menuI put together!
 Wow!
 Wait, wait!
 My own prized secret trainingmethods are inscribed here.
 Don’t read this whereother people might see it!
 Okay!
 Well, do your best!
 I’m gonna use thisto train vigorously!
 Thank you, Pervy Sage!
 The walls have ears…paper doors have eyes…
 Pervy Sage’s secret training methods…
 WILLPOWER
 What?!
 Pervy Sage!
 Since I have been entrusted
 with the great Village Hiddenin the Leaves that you built,
 no matter what danger might strike,it is my duty to protect it.
 The Hokage sure has it tough, huh.
 Yes, you really do.
 Is that you, Shizune?Enter!
 All of these reports regardingthe village’s internal affairs accumulated
 because so many thingswere happening in the Leaf Village.
 I guess the only thing to dois start at the top.
 Leaf Maximum Security Facility.
 Did its name change?
 Yes, in the pastit was called
 Prison Specializing inCapital Offenses Ninja.
 Fortunately, because thereis a downward trend
 in felonies committed by Shinobi,
 along with the downsizing of the facility,the name was changed as well.
 Incarcerated are murderers,
 those who were involved inleaking classified secrets, and so on.
 They are all criminal Ninja…
 There haven’t been any noticeabledisruptions in the past few years
 and the facility has beenrelatively stable.
 – Food! 					– Food!
 It’s finally time to eat,isn’t it, Elder Brother!
 Yeah! I’m so excited!
 Hey! Fujin! Raijin!
 If you don’t shut up,you’re gonna go without dinner!
 Gimme a break! Those guys…
 You may pass!
 Hey! Wait!
 You’re hurt, aren’t you?
 Go to the dispensary laterand have that looked at.
 Okay…
 All right, next!
 H-Hey, Elder Brother…
 Huh?
 Why is the little fingershort and weak?
 That’s easy, Raijin.
 If the little finger was thick and strong,
 then your thumb wouldhave no leg to stand on.
 I-I see!
 Elder Brother…Elder Brother…!
 – Huh? 					– A lizard!
 Raijin, you’ve always beena dandy one from way back.
 W-We haven’t had enough to eat,have we, Elder Brother?
 Yeah…
 Not asking permission again…
 What’s the matter?
 What’s up this time?
 I’m starving…
 G-Give us something to eat!
 Oh no… If these guys find outI don’t have anything…!
 Um…right now…
 Don’t tell me thatyou don’t have even one offering…
 to these Fujin andRaijin brothers?!
 Well…wait…wait…!
 What do you think? Tastes good, huh?
 I’ll bring you something else later!
 Right now make do with that!
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Are you okay?
 Those guys are quietwhen they have food.
 But if they get angrythey’re out of control.
 Yeah…They annihilated all their comradesover food during a mission
 and the people around just barelymanaged to hold them down.
 Something smells good?!
 Yeah.
 This way!
 – Food! Food! Food!– Food! Food! Food!
 I just can’t get to liking clerical work.
 There’s still a whole lot more to do,Lady Tsunade.
 I wonder what this is?
 It looks like a formulafor some kind of medicine…
 A formula…
 Send an available Jonin hereimmediately!
 Yes, ma’am?
 Hurry!
 Y-Yes, ma’am!
 How about it…Does it taste good?
 I see…I see…There’s still a whole lot more.
 Just as I thought,
 that good smell was comingfrom your place, Elder Brother!
 Uh yeah…’Cause Elder Brotheralways has delicious food!
 It was worth sneaking, wasn’t it?
 ’Cause I’d feel so sorryif you guys had to go hungry.
 Elder Brother…
 – A lizard! 					– A lizard!
 I see, I see…Happy?
 How about it, you guys?
 Don’t you want to eat thingsthat are even more delicious?
 W-Where are they at?!
 If we go to the place wherean old friend of mine is…
 you can pig out on foodthat’s even more delicious than here.
 Is that the guy you told usabout long time ago, Elder Brother?
 Yeah, Lord Orochimaru…
 Gimme a break…that guy’s gotta be kidding!
 That Pervy Sage…
 just leaving me andmy training up in the air!
 Come on, don’t say that, Naruto.
 Master Jiraiya had a mission too.
 Heh!
 It’s probably thatLady Tsunade decided
 that only Master Jiraiyacould do the job…
 It can't be helped.
 Damn! So it was Old Lady Tsunade’sdoing, after all, huh!
 Well, I guess all I can do is treat youto some ramen noodles like this.
 So cheer up.
 I’m gonna go complainto Old Lady Tsunade!
 Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!
 N-Naruto!
 Damn… another annoying situation.
 Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!
 This is about a year ago,
 a Chunin Academy staff memberused Naruto
 to sneak outthe Scroll of Sealing.
 According to the report, it wasa crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.
 The crime was solved, but…?
 Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.
 The possibility has arisen thata bigger mastermind is behind this crime.
 This is a clue…
 This is something that Mizukiwas concealing
 when he was incarceratedin the Maximum Security Facility.
 At the time, nobody thought of itas anything more than a doodle.
 Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?
 I don’t know, however…
 The handwriting resemblesthe document confiscated from the facility
 where Orochimaru was conductinghuman experiments…
 Which means that…Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!
 The possibility of that is not zero.
 It’s not like a Chunin alone could doanything with the Scroll of Sealing.
 It would only make sense if Orochimaruwere pulling strings from behind.
 Asuma! Kurenai!
 Go immediately to the MaximumSecurity Facility and interrogate Mizuki!
 Orochimaru?!
 Be careful! Something’s strange here!
 Yeah… It’s too quiet.
 Let’s go!
 Oh, how touching.A welome party for us…
 Yeah…we’re giving you a big welcome.Right, Elder Brother?
 Yeah…
 Asuma, don’t tell me thatthose guys are…
 Uh huh…The legendary idiot brothers…
 Fujin and Raijin!
 Asuma…
 Hey, you guys are whooping it uptoo much for a welcome party!
 Hey, calm down…the welcome party’s just started.
 His character has changed completely…
 All you jerks…
 You will…be our offering!
 Do it!
 Orochimaru!
 Asuma Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What’s the matter, Ton Ton?
 What in the world happened?
 Say, weren't you togetherwith Shizune?
 Don't tell me something'shappened to her?
 I don't know what happened,but take me there, Ton Ton!
 I'm getting a bad feeling about this!

44,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 And the next match.
 This year’s rookie looks challenging…
 Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka
 It’s here, it’s here, it’s here!
 What we’ve been waiting for!
 It’s finally my turn!
 Yeah! Lucky us!
 If it’s this guy,we’ll absolutely win, Akamaru!
 Show us how much you’ve grown.
 I’m going to do it!
 Akamaru Unleashed!Who's Top Dog Now?
 The seventh battle,Naruto Uzumaki versus Kiba Inuzuka.
 I got sick of waiting!
 It’s finally time for me to shine!Believe it!
 That’s my line!
 With you as my opponent,I’ve as good as won!
 Right, Akamaru?
 Don’t get excited!
 You won’t be able to beat me!
 Why you little…!
 Hey! Don’t bring your puppy!
 He’ll get in the way of the match!
 You fool!
 Akamaru’s going to fight with me.
 Hey, hey! Is that okay?
 Yes.
 Animals and insects are treatedthe same as ninja tools.
 There’s no problem.
 Well, that’s fine!
 It’s a perfect handicap!
 Talking tough!
 Then…
 Akamaru, don’t put a paw in this.
 I’ll fight him by myself!
 Naruto! Don’t lose to a guy like this!
 It’s finally come.
 Naruto, huh?
 I’m sorry, but he can’t beat Kiba...
 Kakashi.
 Naruto...
 I-I want to support you, but…
 Kiba’s on my team…
 Kiba will get mad…
 But…
 Naruto…
 Kiba’s lucky.
 Hah!
 Hah! I don’t know how strong he’s becomesince this guy became a Genin…
 Today we’ll run through Transformation Jutsu.
 You’ll change yourself into Lord Hokage…
 His ability was “that,” so…
 Transform!
 So noisy...
 I was sleeping comfortably…
 T-That was a joke!I-I did it on purpose!
 Enough, Naruto!
 It’s your third yearat the academy!
 Wha--?
 Goodness sake, who is that guy?
 We’ve just switched to this classand already found someone funny.
 That guy, he’s on a roll.
 He’s an attention-seeker, huh?
 One more time, fool!
 Transform!
 You…
 Is it possible…?
 Hey hey, are you serious?
 You’ve been here for three years andcan’t even do a respectable transformation?
 All of you watch now!
 I will absolutely someday become the true and a real Hokage!
 Lame!
 What Hokage?!
 Some sympathy at the very least…
 I’ll do you in, in one clean blow!
 Really? But you can’t beat me!
 I said not to act tough.
 Well then. Please begin!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:All-Four Jutsu!
 Here I come!
 Fast!
 It will be a while ‘tilhe opens his eyes, Mr. Proctor.
 Just as I thought.
 That Naruto can’t be equal to Kiba.
 Naruto…
 That was too embarrassing to watch.
 See…
 What was that?That guy is weak.
 Naruto!
 Huh?
 Yes, that’s it…
 I’ll surpass Hokage!
 Then everyone in the village willacknowledge my existence!
 Those are his words…
 I’ve always made fun of them, too.
 This is the Jonin…a true Ninja…
 I have to escape…
 If I stay like this…
 I’ll really, really be killed!
 Are you hurt…
 Scaredy cat?
 You just need to becomestronger than me!
 Darn you!
 You!
 What are you doing all of a sudden?!
 T-This stupid coward is...absolutely... not the Sasuke I know!
 Don’t mess with me!
 W-What?
 But, it was wrong!
 Hey...
 are you hurt?
 Scaredy cat?
 I won’t change my words,that’s my way of Ninja!
 Naruto...
 Say it to everyone!
 Don't...
 Don't...
 underestimate me!
 Yeah!
 He seems to have grownto say such thing.
 Naruto…!
 Go, Naruto!
 What are you talking about,bleeding like that?
 Your tough talk has gone too far!
 I didn’t use my power fully…to observe your strength first!
 You too, cut out the tough talkand use the dog or whatever you want!
 You’ll regret this…
 Let’s go Akamaru!
 Smoke Ball?
 Take this!
 I can’t see!
 This is bad!
 I have to get out of the smoke…or I’ll be done for.
 It worked!
 What is it…?
 Shoot…I can’t see anything.
 Yeah! We did it!
 Yay! Good job, Akama--!
 A-Akamaru…
 Why?
 Why?
 You took the bait!
 Y-You!
 Transform Jutsu?!
 Ouch! Shoot!
 Let go!
 You smell like a dog!
 W-Where’s Akamaru?!
 Over here!
 Akamaru! Darn!
 No way!
 That's Naruto?!
 An equal match with Kiba…
 No, it may be more than equal!
 Applying Shadow Clone Jutsuto Transform Jutsu, that’s a clever trick.
 Naruto shouldn’t be able to do that…
 His timing at using Jutsu’s is very good.
 What? He’s better than I thought.
 But, to get mad like that afterbiting the opponent himself…
 What a funny guy.
 N-Naruto…amazing!
 That’s amazing, Naruto!
 You got a little bit stronger.
 But it’s over.
 Next, I’ll attack you seriously.
 Oh really?!
 But you will absolutely not beat me!
 During this exam,he’s matured again.
 This is a surprise…
 That’s Naruto, the perpetual goof…?
 Evidently it’s no longer “that” Naruto.
 Yeah.
 I wonder, what kindof trick Kakashi used…?
 Still…
 Huh?
 As for the development ofmy Kiba and Akamaru,
 it's probably more than Naruto.
 Naruto…I’ll take Akamaru... back!
 W-What's this?!
 What did you feed him?His fur turned red!
 That’s why he’s called “Akamaru”, red boy.
 Food Pills huh…?
 That Kiba…
 He intends to end it with this.
 Here we go, Akamaru!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…!
 Man Beast Clones!
 T-There’s something wrongwith their eyes!
 He’s using some weird drug!
 Isn’t this doping?
 Is this okay?!
 Yes. Food Pills are one of Ninja Tools.
 You, that’s all you say!
 What?!
 What did that guy eat?
 It’s Food Pills.
 F-Food Pills?
 Food Pills are a secret medicinethat people in the military take
 and fight for three days andthree nights without a break…
 They’re high in protein,easily absorbed and
 have some types of componentthat influence agitation or sedation…
 Kiba and Akamaru’s Chakra mustbe doubled right now…
 It’s over with this…
 Let’s go!
 All-Four...
 Jutsu!
 N-Naruto!
 That Naruto is in danger!
 Kiba’s the gung-ho fighter typewho will attack
 like a beast with Chakra wiredthroughout his body.
 And the Food Pills that double one’sChakra are quite simply…
 the perfect pill for Kiba.
 Naruto…
 This isn’t good…
 There’s no way to counterattack…
 All I can do is gather allthe Chakra in my legs
 and do my best to escape…!
 At this rate…
 Here’s my chance!
 Take this!
 Man Beast Taijutsu Ultimate Technique!
 Fang Over Fang!
 This is the difference inour true powers.
 I'm going...
 to become the Hokage.
 I can’t lose here...!
 You? Hokage?!
 When you’re weaker than me?
 I’ll become Hokage for you!
 You know deep down insidethat you can’t become the Hokage.
 So quit acting tough!
 You’re wrong, Kiba…
 Naruto...
 He’s not that weak…
 I’ll receive the name...of Lord Hokage!
 All of you, just watch!
 Naruto, unlike me...
 he has always believed in his own worth.
 I thought it was really amazing…
 It must have been really hard…
 I understand that.
 And yet before not even one person…
 tried to see Naruto.
 Hey, that’s the kid…
 I heard he’s the only one...who failed.
 Humph! Serves him right!
 It’s trouble if a kid like thatbecomes a Ninja.
 After all, that kid is really…
 Stop! Anything further is taboo.
 Nobody tried to acknowledgereal Naruto.
 Clone Jutsu!
 But now…
 Everyone’s watching…
 Stand up! Naruto!
 Everyone is acknowledging him!
 If you compete with me forthe name of Hokage…
 You…will be the loser!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 That Kiba, he sure is stupid.
 Think hard about your Jutsuwhen you use them.
 Otherwise, your opponentswill take advantage of the Jutsu.
 Well, the outcome of you and mecould be seen from the beginning.
 The way you’ve torn me apartup until now,
 I’ll give it back all at once!

 How is she?
 I don’t know whyshe suddenly collapsed…
 I see.
 The collection ships departin the morning.
 We should get back to the inn.
 But then,what will happen to Isaribi?
 Who cares?She’s the Demon of the Ocean!
 But…
 Naruto, what in the world happenedwith you and that girl?
 Aw c’mon! I told youa little while ago, she saved me!
 What happened?
 Sorry, my hand slipped.
 I see.
 I’ll clean this up right away.
 Anko.
 Yes?
 The studies here,the Hokage knows about them.
 I understand.
 So, you’re saying that this girlnamed Isaribi saved you?
 Yeah, I owe my life to her.
 Even if that’s so, there’s no doubtthat this girl named Isaribi
 was one of the peoplewho attacked us.
 Our mission is to protectthe government’s money
 and catch the Demon of the Ocean.
 That’s right, and no matterhow you look at it,
 there’s no doubt thatshe’s the Demon of the Ocean!
 Yeah, but I think there’s some reasonfor all that.
 I’m going to follow her and--!
 You’re talking nonsense.
 Besides, even if we were to follow her,we've got no idea where she is.
 No, I have one.
 Really, Shino?
 It’s something I heard.
 It seems there’s one islandin this country
 that played a central role in a seriesof spiriting away incidents.
 Where is it?!
 A deserted island wherethe Demon of the Ocean lives,
 Demon Island.
 Demon Island?
 Sensei, are you doing okay?
 Yes, more importantly,
 there’s something I want to tell youabout the Demon of the Ocean.
 The true identity of this thing calledthe Demon of the Ocean
 is a human whose fleshhas been altered.
 What?!
 What did you say?
 Don’t muck things up like that again.
 Yes sir.
 She's out, the monster!
 What the…?
 – Get out of here.– You're bad luck.
 Take this!
 She's the one who was spirited away.
 And why would she bethe only one who came back?
 What are you talking about?
 A spiriting away that occurredten years ago in the Land of Sea,
 but that was not the workingof a demon.
 Orochimaru kidnapped humansto use as live subjects
 for his research at the time.
 Orochimaru…
 Is Orochimaru mixed upin this current matter?
 Wait a minute.Orochimaru and tests!
 Why are you suddenlysaying such things?
 I have to explain it to you fromwhen Orochimaru left the village.
 Over ten years ago,
 Orochimaru’s desire to satisfy his owninquiring mind and further his power
 was such that he graduallyexceeded the scope of a Shinobi
 and in the end, got involved in developingwhat are called Forbidden Jutsu.
 How unfortunate.
 Naturally, this soon becameknown to the village.
 After Orochimaru!
 Stop that guy!
 But Orochimaru, who traveledin and out of country on missions…
 had several other private facilitiesoutside of the Leaf Village…
 So one of those is on Demon Island?
 So, the people who disappeared?
 They were used forhuman experiments.
 What?
 Damn Orochimaru!What does he think people are?
 So, what are we going to do?
 It’s obvious, isn’t it?We get into their hideout!
 And we have to getlsaribi back!
 It’s settled.
 We’ll continue and hitthe Demon of the Ocean’s hideout.
 Sensei, how long have you knownabout Demon Island?
 It’s because Orochimaruwas the Jonin in charge of me.
 Huh?
 Tell me when we get closeto the island.
 The pain is gradually getting stronger.
 Somebody’s coming.
 What shall we do?
 Do as you please.
 Yes.
 The arrogance…One day I’ll pay him back!
 This way.
 Hurry!
 How is it, Shino?
 No problem.
 Okay!
 So, a collection shipis on the move, huh?
 Just the right time.
 Good work, I was right to send youback to Mother Island.
 What’s wrong? You’re pale.
 When will I return to normal?
 Like you said, I’ve gatheredinformation about the ships
 from the marketand the village, even the attacks.
 So…
 What are you bringing up, Isaribi?
 You can’t possibly have forgottenyour role as a prototype.
 As a converted body,your cooperation in generating data…
 That was oneof the conditions of the promise.
 Don’t worry, we’ll soon be donegetting data from you.
 I’ll keep the promise…as long as I don’t change my mind.
 You understand, right?
 Yes.
 Well, if you understand,go keep our guests company.
 I understand…
 You’re vicious, too.
 There’s no sign of ‘em.
 What is this?
 Birds, no fish?
 Don’t move!
 Too bad, isn’t it?
 Don’t mess with Shinobifrom the Leaf Village.134.01	02:26:06:15	02:26:07:19	You, little…!
 Well, well,aren’t these cute kitties?
 Is everyone okay?
 Yep.
 As always, you peopleare addicted to peace.
 You’re from last evening!
 Your face looks familiar.
 The Chunin Exams,if I remember correctly.
 That’s right…
 As I recall, Sasuke’s adversary!
 The guy who was withthat Kabuto?!
 You are correct…
 Of course,I haven’t seen him since then.
 You used a strange Jutsuto suck up other’s Chakras.
 You’re the guy who sucked upall of Sasuke’s strength.
 Well, all of you, come at me.I’m different than I was then.
 Okay, I’ll finish you off right now!
 Wait, Naruto!
 Shino?
 You go ahead.Seems like I’m the opponent for him.
 Huh?
 His Jutsu is not suited foryour style of close combat.
 We can’t have all three of us stay here.
 All right.
 – We’re counting on you, Shino!– Be careful!
 Wait!
 Parasitic Insects, eh?
 Found ‘im!
 Who?
 Welcome, or should I say,haven’t seen you in a while?
 It’s you, Amachi.
 I’m surprised!
 I can’t believe you’ve come backafter something like that happened…
 Like what?
 You don’t remember?
 Sorry, but I have no businesswith you…
 Where is Orochimaru?
 Orochimaru?
 Don’t play dumb.He’s here, isn’t he?
 A Curse Mark responds eventhough the operator isn’t around…
 Stuff like that happens huh?
 True, Orochimaru was here…
 But that was over half a month ago.
 No way.
 It doesn’t matter if you don’tbelieve me.
 So the pain I felt so far…
 has been the influence of Orochimaru’spresence here half a month ago?
 Wait a minute.
 Sensei!
 You two!
 Oh my, you brought Genin.
 Anko, you’re all grown up…
 Who is that?
 Amachi… a Medical Ninjawho partnered with Orochimaru,
 and was runningvarious experiments here.
 Orochimaru’s not here.This whole incident was all his doing.
 Him?!
 Hey you! How dare you runthose ridiculous tests!
 Ridiculous? This is no joke,I’ve devoted my life to this research.
 What was that?!
 Look! This one has the physical abilityto adapt to water.
 She combines the abilityto breathe underwater
 and the muscle strengthto move freely and quickly.
 It’s been a dream of minefor many years,
 to form a Ninja corpsfor underwater combat.
 This is the first step.
 A Ninja corps for underwater combat?
 That’s right, a military corps ableto move freely underwater
 that the common persondefinitely could not imitate.
 When that happens,we can divide land and land
 and completely controlmarine shipping routes!
 Wonderful, is it not?
 With this strength,I’ll stand on top of the world.
 And I’ll make Orochimaru regretabandoning this research.
 People are not your tools!
 Oh my, you're so young,
 you don’t understand the greatnessof this research…
 Well, you’re average guinea pigswho don’t know any better,
 so I don’t think I want you to understand.
 Bastard!
 That’s good, Isaribi.
 Out of the way, Isaribi!
 No!
 What’s wrong? You can’t fightby just running around in circles.
 Damn it!
 Why are you protecting that guy?
 That guy did this to you, Isaribi!
 Yeah, but…!
 But it can’t be helped.
 This is the only person who canreturn my body back to normal.
 He promised.
 Look.
 Isaribi…
 People are judged based solelyon their appearance.
 People don’t dare come near mejust from being covered in bandages……
 A monster with these scaleswould be out of the question.
 I want to return to my former body,I want to be a human!
 For that reason,I decided I’d do anything!
 You’re a human being even now, Isaribi!
 Huh?!
 And yet you join with those guysto attack and sink ships.
 Isn’t that far more like somethinga monster would do?!
 Stop it, shut up!
 I-I…
 I don’t want to hear it!Shut up, shut up!
 Stop it! Are you bullying me, too?
 No… I-I’m the same as you!
 You’re lying!
 What are you talking about?You’re a normal human.
 I want to be like you too!
 Don’t cry Isaribi…I’ll properly return you to normal.
 Watch out!
 A bulls-eye letter bomb.
 Thanks to Isaribi doing a good jobof attracting your attention.
 S-Sensei…
 I’ll leave the rest to you.
 Okay.
 Let’s go, Isaribi.
 Wait!
 Don’t go, Isaribi!
 Damn it!
 We’d better take care ofthis right away.
 Give it up… It’s over.
 We’ll make you a guinea pigfor Amachi, too.
 Insect clone?!
 We’re the sameChakra-eating colleagues, after all.
 It won’t be easy to finish a fight.
 He disappeared?
 What is he thinking?
 There you go!
 Naruto!
 I’m going to strangle youto death like this.
 What--?!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu, a success.
 All right, you did it, Ino!
 Damn it!Let me go, let me go!
 That’s dirty of you!
 What are you talking about?
 There are no such things asbeing too dirty or crappy for Shinobi.
 And you call yourself a Ninja?
 Shut up!
 What?
 This place is collapsing.
 They’re planning to take careof us along with the building.
 Oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me!
 Hurry, the entrance isalready useless.
 I thought this place wouldbe traced soon.
 It’s an old building,
 but a damn good tombfor the likes of them.
 One person didn’t make it in time?
 Oh well, doesn’t have much of an influenceon attacking a collection ship.
 Damn! Where’s the exit?!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Well, where’s the exit, Shino?!
 How should I know?
 Then, what do we do, Ino?!
 We just have to stop complainingand run!
 But I don’t see an exit at all!
 It seems the exit has collapsed.
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Are we going to be buried alive?!
 – No!– Since it's come to this…
 – I’ll use my Rasengan!– What're you doing?
 – How can you be calm?!– Oh, shut up!
 You guys step back a little!

 I don’t know what you’re up to…
 but the timing is perfect.
 This thing of mine also takes time!
 Hey, is something the matter?
 No…
 It must be my imagination…
 Hurry up!
 Sensei…
 Hm?
 What did you mean when you saidthat you didn’t get here late for nothing?
 Hmm…
 You want to know why?
 Like I said, this isn’t the timeto be talking about that!
 Shut up and watch him.
 ‘Cause you’ll get a real surprise.
 That idiot…
 Gaara…we never know whenthe signal is going to come!
 Yeah…I’m gonna tear him open.
 That’s how it comes out.What?
 The contents…
 Lots and lots are coming out, right?
 I’ll give it all to you.
 I’m always a good boy!
 Yeah, let’s do it.
 Mother, I’m watching so…
 Darn! He’s totally useless,no matter what we do now.
 He’s not evenabiding by the plan.
 He looks like he’s just goingto screw things up!
 That Gaara!
 Hey, hey, wouldn’t itbe better if we flee…?
 Plan…?
 How’s it going?
 All preparations are proceedingin accordance with the timeline.
 Please hurry up with preparationfor Summoning.
 I want to be sure we’re able tomake our move at any time.
 Understood!
 All right, I’ll leave that to you.
 D-Don’t tell me that…
 The reason I decided totrain Sasuke was…
 because he was like me.
 A physical Activation?!
 I see…
 That’s why he went throughthe physical training
 and increased his speed significantly…!
 That’s right!
 Awesome…
 The Chakra is clearly visibleto the naked eye…
 What in the world is happening?!
 Don’t tell me thathe learned that Jutsu…!
 So this is the Uchiha Clan…
 Exactly…
 W-What the heck is that?!
 What a sound!What’s that technique?
 That’s just a jab…
 Huh?!
 However, it is the one used byLeaf Village’s number one technician.
 That’s the only original techniqueof the Copy Ninja, Kakashi…
 It’s the special technique usedonly for assassinations…
 Its secret is in the speed of the jab,
 and also the physical aptitudethat gives forth a gigantic Chakra,
 the ability of the Chakra tofocus solely on the target,
 and moreover the speed ofthe jab makes a “chichichichichi” sound…
 A unique sound attack similarto the rumbling of a thousand birds.
 And that’s why that technique is called…
 Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
 No way!That Gaara’s absolute protection is…
 It’s impossible…
 Don’t tell me…
 Excellent work…
 That’s…
 Kakashi’s…
 Chidori…Also known as Lightning Blade.
 Lightning Blade?
 Lightning Blade is another namefor the Jutsu derived
 from Kakashi’s ability to cut throughlightning using that technique.
 Huh? Cut through lightning?
 Huh? That sounds fishy…
 A-Awesome…
 The real name of that techniqueis Chidori…
 The secret is the speed of his jabthat surpasses any human limitations
 and the intensity ofthe Chakra on his arm…
 And that arm turns virtuallyinto the equivalent of the swing
 of a celebrated sword thatcuts through everything.
 But what a reckless technique…
 That’s not for you to say…
 Right, Lee?
 It’s beyond my scope ofcomprehension, but…
 What an awesome technique!
 I can understand it…
 If it were me, if I madea running start at that speed,
 I wouldn’t make a direct jab attackon the opponent…
 Or rather, I couldn’t.
 For an opponent,
 a straight line attack just gives himan easy chance to launch a counterblow.
 And moreover, I don’t have the eyesto read that counterblow.
 I envy you…Sasuke!
 When I fought you once, I said…
 Even if one understands visually,
 it’s meaningless unlessone can move physically…
 I was filled witha feeling of superiority.
 But now, you have a body that movesat the same high speed as mine.
 Moreover, you have…
 the Sharingan!
 I caught you!
 Third Squadron.We are ready any time.
 All preparations are completeon this end too.
 Roger. Proceed with actionat the signal.
 Looks like it’s almost time.
 The guy who was worrying aboutSasuke until just a moment ago…
 is now jealous of him.
 Sasuke…
 This is the feeling!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 I’ve gotten stronger…
 In order to become Hokage…
 In order not to lose to anyone…
 Sasuke!
 In order not to lose to you.
 I want…to fight you, too.
 But you are…
 Yeah…
 What…? This warm thing…?
 Mother…? What is…?
 Blood…my blood is…!
 D-Don’t tell me that…
 D-Don’t tell me thatGaara is hurt?!
 What is it?!
 It’s that thing’s arm!
 Darn! Doing somethingcareless like that…
 Has the Perfect Possession happened?
 I don’t know.He seems to be injured…
 This has never happened before.
 It gives me the chillsjust to remember…
 When I first saw that thing,I wasn’t able to eat…
 I mean, visually it’s totally…
 What is…
 this sensation?
 He’s hurt, after all…
 The shell was broken whenhis body was incomplete!
 It’s different! Those aren’t the eyes!
 W-What was that…that look earlier on?!
 Huh…?
 What’s this…? I can’t see…
 Kakashi! This must be!
 Yeah…a Genjutsu!
 – Release! 					– Release!
 What’s going on…?
 Release!
 Genjutsu!ls Kabuto already moving?
 In that case, it’s just about time…
 It’s coming!
 Shall we begin?!
 It’s the signal!
 – Start the operation!– Start the operation!

 Huh?
 One more, you said, eh…?
 Just when I thought you’d snuck out ofyour hospital room
 and were doing some training…
 You guys want some, too?
 Pop, here's the tab.
 Thanks for your business!
 Jeez, I’m fine!
 Naruto, even if it looks like you’ve healedon the surface, you’re still battered.
 It’s not like that!I have to train and get stronger!
 Yeah-yeah,after you’ve healed completely.
 Damn it! I have to keep my promiseto Sakura without further delay…!
 Sakura… You’re so pathetic.
 Naruto…This is a…once in a lifetime request...
 Please bring…please bring Sasuke back.
 I couldn’t do it!I wasn’t able to stop Sasuke!
 At this point, the only person whowould be able to stop Sasuke…
 who would be able to save him…
 Is you…Naruto…
 All I did…was cry…All I did was totally rely on Naruto.
 I didn’t do anything myself.
 Naruto tried to bring back Sasukeeven if it meant his life…
 What can I do for Sasuke now…?
 I just have to put my life on the lineand do it!
 It’s futile. The ropes are madeof a maiden’s black hair.
 And the knot is a Shinobireverse butterfly knot.
 It won’t be easily untied.
 Give me a break.
 I have to start training as soon as possibleand get stronger.
 Then do as the Medical Corps saysand rest quietly.
 Come in.
 Oh…
 Sorry, Sakura…
 I’d like to get moving immediatelyif possible, but…
 He has astonishing recuperative power,but overdoing it is a big no-no.
 I’m okay!
 Be a little more patient!
 Just wait a little longer!I’ll keep my promise, no matter what!
 No…
 It’s okay…
 Up until now,I was totally reliant on you…
 and I did nothing, so…
 What’s the matter, Sakura…?
 Did something happen?!
 No… I'm was relievedto see you doing well.
 This time, I’ll do my best.
 Sakura…?
 I heard you snuck out of the hospital.
 Do you want to train that badly?
 Pervy Sage…? My…apple!
 Well well, things looklike they’re going smoothly.
 Don't you worry.I’ll train you hard right away.
 Umm…about the training.
 I was wondering if you couldwait a little while longer.
 Hmm?
 I’m not saying I don’t want to train.
 But I remembered someodds and ends I need to take care of.
 Oh?
 Odds and ends, huh?
 Come on. Please?
 Come in!
 Oh, I’ve been spotted, huh?
 I’m guessing, you want to peep?
 No matter how long you wait,I won’t show anything.
 Wh-Who’d peep at an old lady?!
 N-No, I take that back!
 Actually, I’ve come to makean earnest request to you as the Hokage.
 Talk.
 This time, I’ll do my best.
 It couldn’t be that Sakura’s going to…
 This might be…my last look…
 Sakura…
 How did you…?
 I know what you’re thinking!
 That there’d be nothingI could do even if I were to go…!
 But I hate myself just standing heredoing nothing!
 Always being a hindrance toand taking advantage of everyone…
 Not being able to doone single thing respectably…
 It’s useless to stop me!
 I won’t stop you…
 You should do it until you’re satisfied.
 But…I’m going, too.
 But…
 It’s become just the two of us…
 But we’re a three-man squad, right?
 Yeah.
 You guys…
 Oops! Pervy Sage?
 This person…is Jiraiya,one of the legendary Sannin?
 If you, without permission,
 go out past the border ofthe Village Hidden in the Leaves...
 you know at least that you’ll be sentto prison as Rogue Ninja, right?
 It’s no use stopping us!
 I won’t stop you.
 You’ve been given a missionby Lady Hokage.
 You’re to investigate and reporton the Land of Rice Paddies
 where the Village Hidden in Sound isand where Sasuke has been taken away.
 The mission is set to be carried outin a group of three.
 As of now, you will work under me.You got a problem?!
 It seems they’re the biggest of fools.
 They won’t stop even if you tried.
 At this rate,we’ll lose two important subordinates!
 You’ll recognize it as a special mission
 with the goal of investigatingthe Village Hidden in Sound, right?
 I have no choice, huh…?
 But I have a condition.
 Bring the two back alive. Got it?
 Sure, even if it costs my life.
 It’s too dangerous of a mission evenwith that Jiraiya going with them…
 Sasuke…
 That’s the Land of Rice Paddies wherethe Village Hidden in the Sound is.
 It’s that Orochimaru’s headquarters.
 Take sufficient caution and proceed.
 It’s kind of anticlimactic…
 Here I thought a bunch ofOrochimaru’s followers would greet us!
 Is this really the Hidden Sound Village?
 It seems to be a peaceful,quiet and nice land, but…
 No, we still haven’t enteredVillage Hidden in the Sound.
 This is the Land of Rice Paddies.
 Land of Rice Paddies?
 It’s a small land that’s nothing special.
 The feudal lord was a foolish lord whohungered for powerful military strength
 in order to make the landdisproportionately larger.
 And then Orochimaru probably won favorwith some fast-talking…
 Of course, Orochimaru himself wasn’tthinking about making the land stronger.
 He just had an ambition to make himselfstronger and to carry out revenge…
 That’s why there’s nothing in this areathat points to his presence.
 Really? And so, Pervy Sage…!
 Don’t call me Pervy Sage!
 That’s right…He’s one of the legendary Sannin, so…
 He’s just a lady-lovingperverted Pervy Sage!
 What?!
 More importantly,where’s the Village Hidden in the Sound?
 Beats me… I don’t know…
 What?!
 We don’t know where it is,so we’re going to investigate, right?
 You’ve got a point, but…
 But how do we find it?
 There can’t be a place wherepeople are without food and ladies.
 People gather wherethere’s food and girls!
 – Where people gather, there's news.– There goes Pervy Sage's bad habit.
 He’s planning to sow his wild oatsunder the guise of a special mission.
 First off, finding a traveler’s town withlots of hot ladies is the top priority!
 Every land should have a traveler’s town.
 Lodging
 This is a traveler’s town…right?
 Looks like nobody’s living here anymore.
 No, I feel the presence of people…
 And the smell of face powder!
 – Naruto, take it out.– Take what out?
 Don’t act as you don’t know!
 In anything one does,a war chest is necessary, right?
 What! Are you after my wallet? Man!
 What?! This shouldn’t be it!Try jumping!
 Huh?!
 No! Stop!
 One, two, three… Is this all you got?
 That’s all of it, really!
 – Here… 					– Huh?
 It’s not much, but please use it.
 No! Sakura, there’s no need foryou to give that to him!
 But, it’s money forgathering information, right?
 Right-right. This should be enough.
 You guys go on ahead to the outskirtsof the post station and wait!
 Wh-Why?
 It’s too dangerous ahead from here.lt’s a mission for adults.
 Hmm, the smell offace powder’s from here.
 Welcome…
 Along came a sucker just beggingto be parted from his money.
 We should be able to pulverize him.
 Food and Drink! And young women!
 Even if you give the Pervy Sage money,
 he’s just going to sow his oats withoutgathering any information, anyway.
 Sow his oats…?
 Y-Yeah…I don’t really know about it, but…
 You know, make-out blah-blah-blah…
 It’s fine!lf I can be of at least some help…
 I’m always a hindrancewho can’t do anything, so…
 It’s not like that!
 In the first place,if you hadn’t taken the action…
 I’d still be tied to the bed!
 Brothel
 Even in different lands,there are young women everywhere.
 So? Why don’t we move tothe room in the back?
 I want to talk more relaxed.
 Nice, nice.
 Then first, settle up the tabfor here, okay?
 What, am I already drunkon this cheap drink…?
 Aren’t there like three too many zeros?
 You like to joke, do you?
 If you value your life,leave all you’ve got on you here.
 I see how it is.
 Master Jiraiya’s late.
 I’m sick of waiting.
 Naruto!
 Who’s there?!
 Who’re you?!Are you one of Orochimaru’s followers?!
 What? Was I wrong?!
 Damn it.
 That kid had erased his presenceuntil he’d gotten that close.
 I won’t let him get away!
 Don’t move!
 Wh-Why?!
 Makibishi Spikes!
 Naruto!
 Wh-What?!
 – Hold it! You jerk!– We won’t let you get away!
 Naruto, what’s that?!
 Pervy Sage? What did you do?!
 I’ll tell you later!Anyway, let’s get out of here!
 Why?!
 Companions of the person just now?
 If they’re Orochimaru’s followers,with my Shadow Clone Jutsu, I’ll…
 No, no! Don’t get the wrong idea!
 They’re just bodyguards from a rip-off bar!
 R-Rip-off bar…?!
 First and foremost, this mission hasto be carried out in strict secrecy!
 There’d be no point if you wereto use Ninja Art and stand out!
 You! Carry the bags!
 The one who’s totally standing outis you, Pervy Sage!
 You have a point.
 This is wrong!Will we really reach Sasuke like this?!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Jeez, this is an appallingly unsettled town.
 Well, you guys wait here.
 Huh? Why?!
 Infiltrating up ahead is too dangerous!
 It’s too much for you youngsters.
 Pervy Sage…
 I myself should be the only sacrifice!See ya, Naruto.
 Blah-blah-blah, trying to look good…

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Sasuke!
 Naruto’s certainly differentfrom you, Sasuke.
 He’s a klutz and kind of gets in the way.
 But he’s not in the least a coward!
 Right? Isn’t that’s right?!
 Sasuke!
 You foolish little brother.
 If you want to kill me, resent me, hate me and…
 continue to live your ugly life.
 No...
 Flee.
 Flee and hang on to your life.
 No!
 No!
 The Sharingan Revived:Dragon-Flame Jutsu!
 Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan…
 His blood has begun to stir...
 I should take my time andconfirm his true power.
 I have to live so I can killmy older brother…
 That’s what I thought.
 But it’s me who was being stupid.
 Naruto!
 Sakura!
 How can someone who can’t puthis life on the line at a place like this...
 beat that man?!
 I can see.
 I can see!
 I can see you!
 It’s pretty good…
 You foretell my movements andyour aim is sure.
 You can see my moves, can’t you?
 The sun will set soon…
 I must find him quickly!
 It will become completely darkand my disadvantage will increase.
 But why in the world right now…what’s his goal?
 Well, that’s fine…
 He came to this village.I’ll settle this here and now.
 I got you!
 A substitution!
 Sasuke!
 Humph! 					You are too easy.
 The Uchiha name is crying.
 That’s okay.
 I’ll just take my time and playwith you before I’ll kill you.
 Like a worm.
 This is Sharingan Windmill Triple Attack!
 Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.
 He did it!
 Sasuke!
 You did it!
 Are you okay?
 Hang on.
 Paralysis?
 I didn’t expect that you could useSharingan this much at your age.
 You are truly a memberof the Uchiha clan.
 I do want you, after all.
 You’re definitely his brother.
 Your eyes hide more abilitythan that Itachi.
 Who in the world are you?
 My name is Orochimaru…
 If you think you want to meet me again,desperately run to the top of this test.
 – The Scroll!– Defeat the three...
 Sound Village Ninjaunder my control.
 You are not making sense at all!
 We don’t want to seeyour face ever again, got it?!
 That won’t do.
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 You, what did you do to Sasuke?
 I gave him a parting gift.
 Sasuke absolutely wouldcome look for me…
 looking for power.
 I enjoyed seeing your various powers.
 Sasuke!
 Hold on, Sasuke.
 C'mon!
 Sasuke...
 Sasuke, c’mon!
 Sasuke...
 Sasuke...
 Naruto!
 Sasuke’s... Sasuke’s...!
 Naruto!
 What?
 What should I do?
 I can feel it!
 He’s close by.
 It’s been a while...
 Anko.
 You’re level S class,
 an extremely dangerous person onthe most wanted list.
 That’s why I’ll kill you hereeven if it costs my life.
 That is my duty asyour former subordinate
 who learned it all from you.lsn’t that right, Orochimaru?!
 No, you can’t.
 Striking Shadow Snake!
 I won’t let you escape.
 I got you.
 Orochimaru, I’m gonna borrow your left hand.
 This hand sign…
 Right… you and I are going to die here.
 Ninja Art: Twin Snakes Sacrifice--
 You intend to commit suicide?
 Substitution.
 As you are a Special Joninof the village,
 you can’t be just usingthe forbidden Jutsu I taught you.
 I told you it wouldn’t work.
 Why have you come now?
 It’s our reunion after so long,and you’re awfully cold.
 Don’t tell me that you cameto assassinate Lord Hokage?
 No, no…
 I don’t have enoughsubordinates for that yet…
 I’ve heard of the excellence ones ofthis village and thought I’d put dibs on it.
 A little while ago,
 I gave that same Curse Markas a present.
 There’s a kid that I want.
 Selfish as always.
 That kid will die.
 Certainly… the odds are 1 in 10that he’ll die,
 but he may survive just like you did.
 This kid, you really like him, huh?
 Are you jealous?.
 Hey...
 Are you still holding a grudgethat I used you and threw you away?
 Unlike you, that kid will excel.
 For one thing he inheritedthe Uchiha ability.
 He has beautiful features and isa vessel who can become my heir.
 If that kid lived,it will make things interesting.
 Be sure not to cancel this test.
 Three people from my villageare also under your care.
 Make me enjoy it.
 If something happens todeprive me of my fun,
 consider it the end of Leaf Village.
 We’ve secured food and water afterspending half a day
 and now most teams have halted activity.
 As we planned,this is the time that we attack.
 We'll split up into three and go scouting.
 However, whether we findother teams or not,
 we return to this place.
 Got it?
 Okay.
 Roger.
 Okay.
 Scatter!
 His breathing is graduallygetting regular…
 but he still has a terrible fever.
 I have to protect them both.
 I have to communicate thisto Lord Hokage right away.
 Cripes! At a time like this!
 T-This is Paralysis Jutsu.
 So you are here, Anko.
 You’re pretty late for Anbu Black Ops.
 Well, don’t say that.
 Are you okay, hey?
 Huh? T-This is...!
 The Curse Mark is appearing…
 Don’t tell me…?!
 Is it Orochimaru?
 What, really?
 Now that it’s come to this,we’ll take you to Lord Hokage.
 No, take me to the tower.
 What are you saying?
 The moment Orochimaru comesto this village,
 a strict alert is issued.
 It’s more urgent thancontinuing the Exam.
 I know…
 Anyway, I’ll tell the whole story later,so please call for Lord Hokage.
 I found you.
 As Orochimaru ordered,we’ll wait for daybreak to do it.
 Sasuke Uchiha is our target,not the other.
 If they come in the way, it’s okay to kill the other two, right?
 Of course.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The beautiful wild beast of Leaf Village,Rock Lee, is here!
 Yeah, I did it!I did it, Guy Sensei!
 Now I can get Sakura's heart,right on the mark!
 You could say, in terms of numbers,the disadvantage is mine!
 But on the contrary,the conditions have been met.
 Guy Sensei, I will use that techniquewithout hesitation.

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 You have to think when using Jutsu.
 They can be used against you.
 Also, don't get caughtin an obvious trap, you fool.
 A Ninja must seethrough deception…got it?
 I know that!
 You know, you say that becauseyou don't get it. Listen up.
 Your movements are wasteful.
 Now!
 He finally dropped his guard!
 You're so...
 No way!
 You jerk Sasuke! You overdid it.
 Damn! Another substitution…?
 He must have found out my locationwith those Shuriken!
 He purposely lowered his guard!Serves me right…
 I fell for the trap.
 So he's over there, eh…
 Sasuke…Where are you…?!
 Don't tell me,Kakashi Sensei already…
 No!
 That couldn't happen to Sasuke, right?!
 Safe! He didn't notice me.
 Sakura, behind you.
 Huh?!
 What's up with that ""A Ninja must seethrough deception"" stuff?!
 Darn it! I'll never fall for his trap again!
 I fell for it again!
 You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision
 What was that?! Huh?!
 Hold on! Where's Sensei?!
 Huh?! What's going on?!
 Huh?! What's what?!
 Sakura…
 Sasuke?!
 Sa…Saku…ra…
 P-Please…help…me…
 Maybe I went a bit overboard…
 But it's really somethingshe should notice…
 Was that voice…Sakura's…?
 Shinobi Battle Skill ♪2, Genjutsu.
 Sakura was easily lured.
 Genjutsu, huh...?
 An illusory mind-controlling technique.I'm not surprised she got lured.
 However…
 I'm different from them.
 Why don't you say that afteryou get a bell…Sasuke?
 It's no use just usingstraightforward attacks.
 A trap?!
 What?!
 This guy's...?!
 What a guy.
 There's no timeto read ""Make-Out Paradise.""
 What…? 					I…?!
 That's right! I saw Sasuke onthe verge of dying and I…
 Sasuke!Don't die and leave me here!!
 Where are you?!
 So that's what it looks likebehind the logs.
 Oh! There are box lunches on the stone!
 A Ninja must see through deception... eh?
 Well! I'll acknowledge thatyou're different from those two.
 Horse!
 Tiger!
 Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!
 What?! That's not a Jutsuthat a Genin can do…
 He shouldn't haveenough Chakra yet!
 He's gone!ls he behind me?! No, above me?!
 Where is he?!
 I'm under you!!
 Wha--?!
 Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu.
 Shinobi Battle Skill ♪3, Ninjutsu.
 How's that? You can't move, heh?
 Although, you're…already startingto make your mark.
 But, oh well.
 They do say that the nail that sticks upgets hammered down, so…
 Damn it!
 I don't have to naively take those bells.I'll just eat in secret right now!
 Let's eat!!
 Hey.
 I was just joking…
 Too late!
 Darn it…! Is there this much ofa difference in strength…?
 Sakura...
 This time it's a freshly severed head?!
 What's up with her?
 Sasuke?
 You're okay!
 Hey, cut it out!Don't cling to me!
 There's not much time left until noon.I'm going.
 Sasuke, you're still goingafter the bells?!
 I was able to touch them last time.Next time I'll be able to take them.
 What?! 					I-I see.
 Sure enough,you're awesome, Sasuke.
 There's no way I can takethe bells from Sensei.
 At this rate, I'll faceseparation from Sasuke…
 Uh…say. There's really no time left…
 So let's just take it easy andtry again next time.
 I'm the only onewho can kill that man.
 Huh…? What?You mean Sensei?
 At that time…I was crying.
 Crying…?
 My…
 What…? What is it…?
 I'm an avenger. I must become strongerthan that man…
 I don't have time for setbacks here...
 ...to kill a certain man!
 Damn it…I wasted my time talking.
 Sasuke...
 Oh-oh, your stomachs are growling…
 By the way, about this exercise…
 Well! There's no need for you guysto go back to the Academy.
 What? I… All I did was lay unconscious.
 Is that okay?
 Love is victorious!! Cha!!
 Yahooooo!
 Then, then!That means the three of us…
 Yes. The three of you…
 must quit being Ninja!!
 N-No way!
 Kakashi hasn't passeda single person this whole time…
 Iruka…
 Even I don't know if it's good forthose kids to become Shinobi right away…
 However…Kakashi's judgments were correct…
 Quit being Ninja?! What do you mean?!
 Uh, well it's true, we weren't able totake the bells.
 But why do we have to be told to ""quit""?!
 That's because you're all squirts whodon't have the qualifications to become Ninja.
 Oh!
 Sasuke!
 I'm saying you're squirts.
 Don't step on Sasuke!!
 Are you kids thinking thatbeing a Ninja is easy? Huh?
 Why do you think you're doingthis exercise in teams?
 Huh?! What do you mean?
 Put simply…
 it's as if you guys have nounderstanding of the answer to this test.
 Answer…?
 Yes. The answer that determinespassing or failing of this test.
 That's…what I've wanted to askabout for a while now.
 Man, are you guys brainless or what?
 Don't you get the meaning ofthe three-man squad?!
 Jeez!! What of three people to a squad?!
 That's…teamwork!
 You mean, working together?
 Exactly. But it's too late evenif you realize that now.
 You might've been able to…
 take the bells if the three of youhad come at me…
 Well, it's too bad.
 Now wait a minute.
 Why use teamwork ifthere were only two bells?
 If the three of us were to desperately gotake the bells with one having to hold back,
 that wouldn't be teamwork.That'd create internal discord.
 Of course!
 This is a test set up to purposelyplace you against each other.
 It's under just such conditionswhere one's own interests aren't the issue.
 The intention was to select thosewho could prioritize teamwork…
 Despite this, you fools…
 Sakura!
 You were only concerned with Sasuke andyou didn't even know where he was.
 And you didn't care for Naruto who wasright in front of your eyes…
 Naruto!
 All you do is run solo…
 You labeled the other two as hindrancesand acted on your own…
 Missions are carried out in squads!
 There's no mistaking that Ninjas needunsurpassed individual skills…
 But ""teamwork"" is consideredmore important than that.
 Individual actions that disrupt teamworkthrow the team into crisis and lead to death…
 For example...
 ""Sakura! Kill Naruto, or else Sasuke dies…""
 What?! What?! Whaaat?!
 Is what will…happen.
 Oh, I was so surpised.
 On top of having a hostage taken,
 you're faced with two impossible choicesand end up being killed.
 Every mission isa life-risking assignment.
 Look at this…
 The many names engravedon this stone…
 These are all Ninjas who are calledheroes in the village.
 That-that-that-that! I like thaaat!
 I've decided now to getmy name engraved there, too!
 A hero! A hero!I'm not going to die like a dog!
 But…they're not just ordinary heroes.
 No kidding. Then, what kindof heroes are they?
 Hey! Hey!
 They are heroeswho were killed in action.
 Killed in action?
 It means they diedperforming a mission.
 This is a memorial.
 The names of my friendsare also engraved here...
 I'll give you guys one more chance!
 However, after noon it'll bea harsher battle to take the bell.
 Those who want to take onthe challenge can eat lunch.
 However, don't let Naruto have any.
 It's punishment for breaking the rules andattempting to eat lunch on your own.
 If someone lets him eat…
 that person will be disqualifiedon the spot.
 I make the rules, here. Got it?!
 I must be going.
 Listen to me, Iruka.
 What?
 No matter what the result,don't hold it against Kakashi…
 Alright.
 I'm okay with not eating lunch!No sweat at all!
 No sweat…
 Here.
 H-Hey, Sasuke.Sensei just said…!
 It's okay.There's no sign of him now.
 The three of us are going to gotake the bells together.
 It'll be trouble for meif he becomes a hindrance, so...
 Sasuke…
 Sakura…
 Thanks…
 Don't thank me.Just hurry up and eat.
 But…
 I'm on…a diet…I mean I just eat less than Sasuke.
 So you don't need to worry.
 But…
 See…
 Wha--?!
 Hurry it up.We don't know when he'll be back…
 It's just this one time.
 Okay? You got it?!
 I got it.
 You three!
 Yiiikes!
 You defied the rules so thatmeans you know what's coming…
 Do you have…something to say?
 But you see…
 What?!
 But! But! But!You said, Sensei!
 These guys…
 We're a three-man squad, right?
 That's right!The three of us are one, so…!
 That's right! That's right!That's right!
 That's right!
 The three of you are one, eh…
 You pass!
 What?!
 Whaaat?!
 You pass!
 We passed?! Why?!
 You guys are the first.
 Up until now, it was always just dunceswho would meekly listen to what I said.
 A Ninja must see through deception…
 In the world of Ninja,
 those who break rules and codesare branded as garbage…
 But…
 Those who don't cherish their friends aregarbage worse than that.
 He's… He's…kinda…cool…
 That's it for the exercise…
 Everyone passes!
 Group Seven starts their missiontomorrow!
 Yes, Sir!
 I did it!! I'm a Ninja!Ninja! Ninja!
 Let's go home.
 Cha!
 I...
 knew this is how it'd turn out!
 Untie the rope!
 Oh, please! It'd been nothing butblah missions until now.
 And just when I thought I'd finallygotten an awesome mission,
 to think it'd be bodyguardingthis old man.
 He mocks the heck out of me,calling me a brat.
 I'll tell him a thing or two.
 Someday I'll be…Hey, are you listening?!

 My name's Rock Lee.

 I'm supposed to givemy own name first, right?
 Sasuke Uchiha…
 Hmph… So you knew?
 I want to fight with you!
 I want to test out how effectivemy techniques will be

 Also…
 Sakura. Love.
 Noooo!Those lower eyelashes are awful!
 The hairstyle is awful, too!
 Those bushy eyebrows,just too intense!
 Everything is...!
 You're an angel!
 Noooooo!
 You are good at it.Then, how about...?
 Really... That was super close.
 You! Don't throw strange stuff!
 I was dodging for my life!
 You don't have to resent me that much.
 It's Sasuke again!Darn it! Darn it!
 To be honest, you're a naive one,
 knowing the name of Uchihaand challenging me.
 Do you want to realizewhat this name is , Bushy-Brow?
 I insist.
 I'm lucky...
 to be able to have a bout withthe number one rookie right away.
 And, I'll prove it to you, Guy Sensei!
 Wait!
 I AM going to take outthe Bushy-Brow. Believe it!
 Hey, you…!
 Big deal.
 I'll be able to take care of himin just five minutes!
 The one I want to fight isn't you…lt's Uchiha.
 All these people…
 keep saying Sasuke, Sasuke.How annoying!
 Darn it!
 Leaf Whirlwind!
 As I thought, he's strong…
 I declare. You are absolutelyno match for me.
 Because…
 among the Leaf Village Genin,I'm the strongest now.
 He stopped my kick…
 What's with that Chakra in his arm…?
 Interesting. I'll do it.
 Oh…
 Stop! Sasuke!
 There's less than thirty minutesuntil the 3:00 registration.
 Don't worry.
 It'll be over in five minutes.
 Here he comes!
 I'm sorry, Guy Sensei.
 I may end up breaking the taboo.
 I may end up using…that technique!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 I can't get completely outof the way…
 Guard!
 What…?!
 Sasuke!
 W-What's going on?
 But…he did guard himselfjust now, no mistake.
 He got around my guard.
 What is it?
 Is it Ninjutsu…?Or is it Genjutsu…?!
 As I thought, he's going to get up!
 Hmph… That's okay.
 If that's the case,
 this is a good opportunityto get used to THAT.
 I'll do it.
 Huh?! C-Could that be…?
 Sharingan!
 Sasuke, when has he...Why is that in his eyes…
 And in both eyes…!
 Is that the Sharingan?
 Sasuke's awesome, after all!
 If this is the same Kekkei Genkaias Kakashi Sensei's…
 he can read Bushy-Brow's Jutsu!
 Genjutsu or Ninjutsu…
 It's some kind of magic either way…I'll reveal that!
 It feels like Sasuke's rapidlygetting stronger.
 That's to be expectedof the Uchiha clan.
 That's right…Sasuke should not lose to a guy like this.
 Huh?!
 The Sharingan…!
 To not be able to discern the Jutsuwith the Sharingan…
 Could it be…that his technique is…!
 That's right…
 My technique is neitherNinjutsu nor Genjutsu.
 S-Sasuke!
 That's right!
 My technique ismere Taijutsu…Sasuke.
 You may not be able tobelieve it just like that, but…
 Punk!
 It's said that the Sharingan hasthe ability to spot
 all Genjutsu, Taijutsu and Ninjutsu.
 Make no mistake,
 the Sharingan reads Ninjutsuand Genjutsu that
 require the principle of building upChakra and weaving Signs,
 and can most surely handle such Jutsu.
 However, only Taijutsu isa little bit different…
 W-What do you mean?!
 Even if you can spot my movementswith the Sharingan,
 your body is not equipped withthe speed to respond to my Taijutsu.
 In other words, even if you understandwith your eyes,
 there's nothing you can do if yourbody can't keep up.
 Do you know?
 There are two types of strong people,genius-types and effort-types.
 If your Sharingan isa genius-type drawing Uchiha ability…
 I'm an effort-type who haspatiently mastered only Taijutsu.
 In a manner of speaking,
 your Sharingan and my ultimateTaijutsu have the worst compatibility…
 Guard!
 Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow…!
 And I shall prove it with this technique.
 Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
 W-What's he going to do…?!
 It's my victory!
 Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow!
 And I shall prove it with this technique.
 Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
 W-What's he going to do…?!
 It's my victory!
 Huh?!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?!
 That's…!
 That's as far as it goes! Lee!
 W-What is it…?What's going on?
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke was beaten?!
 What happened whileI was knocked out?!
 Are you okay?! Sasuke.
 He's agitated…To think he couldn't fall properly.
 Y-You were watching…?
 Lee! That technique just nowis prohibited, you know!
 W-What's with that turtle…?
 I-I'm sorry.I didn't mean to…
 He's…getting scolded or something…
 Could that be…Bushy-Brow's teacher?!
 B-But, of course,
 I didn't even remotely havea mind to use the Hidden technique…
 There's no mistake!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Hey-hey.
 What…?
 That thing… It's a turtle, right…?Right?
 Isn't it obvious?!
 Say! Say! Can even a turtlebecome a Ninja teacher?
 I don't know!
 Fool!
 You think such subterfuge will work?!
 You should know very well whatit means
 for a Shinobi to give awayhis technique!
 I…I know.
 To think I lost to someone so flippant…
 Have you prepared yourself?
 Y-Yes sir…
 All right, if you will, Guy Sensei!
 Man! Life treating you good, huh?
 Huh?!
 Whoaaa! An even moreintense guy has appeared!
 Yo, Lee!
 Super intense.The extreme bowl cut...
 T-Those are some incrediblyraging brows…
 I've never seen anything like thatin my life.
 H-Hey! You guys!Don't mock Guy Sensei!
 Shut up!
 I'm at a loss for a reaction because
 of those bizarre things appearingone after another!
 What?!
 Hey, Lee! Drop it!
 Yes, sir…
 Idiot!
 Lee, you…you…
 S-Sensei…!
 L-Lee…
 Sensei…I…I…
 Enough, Lee!Don't say anything!
 Sensei!
 Lee!
 I lost to a guy like that…
 Yes…this is adolescence!
 Sensei!
 That sort of tone's kind of nice, too.
 I-Idiot! That's dangerous!Very dangerous!
 It's okay, Lee!
 Mistakes come with adolescence.Don't worry about it!
 You're so kind…Sensei!
 Now then, take a hundred laps aroundthe Training Field toward that setting sun!
 Yes! Sensei!
 Let's go!
 Yes, sir!
 Hey, wait a minute.
 We're still in the middleof the conversation!
 What're you going to doabout the Chunin Exam?!
 There's no time!
 Huh? Oh, that's right…
 Lee, you will be punished for attemptingto break the prohibition on top of fighting…
 in principle, afterthe Chunin Exam.
 Okay!
 Five hundred howls of adolescence!
 Yes, sir!
 Idiots…
 Say! Say!
 By the way, what's with that turtle?
 If I'm not mistaken, those kids are…
 Kakashi's…
 Oh! No, he's looking this way!
 You guys…how's Kakashi Sensei?
 You know Kakashi…?
 I know him all too well.
 People call us…eternal rivals.
 Sounds like a lie!
 What're you saying?!Guy Sensei really is…
 That's fine.
 ""Action speaks louder than words""anyway.
 Huh?!
 By the way, my record is fifty winsand forty-nine losses.
 Huh?!
 This guy…
 When did he...?
 One thing, I'm stronger than Kakashi…
 N-No way…
 He's fast! He's faster than Kakashi!ls he human…?!
 How about that?!Guy Sensei is awesome, isn't he?!
 Darn it…
 This time around,Lee caused the trouble.
 Out of consideration for my face,forgive him.
 Out of consideration forthis pleasant face.
 He's better than that Kakashi…?
 Darn it! He's…
 not just all talk…
 You guys and Lee should probably goto the classroom pretty soon.
 He...!
 Then, do your best, Lee!Farewell!
 Yes, sir.
 What?!
 Sasuke…
 I have one last thing to tell you.
 I actually came here toverify my own ability.
 I lied before.
 The strongest man of theLeaf Village Genin might be on my team.
 I'm entering in orderto defeat that person.
 And, you are one of my targets.
 Please prepare yourself for the Exam!
 Sasuke…
 Ha! So…
 I guess Uchiha clan's not all that, huh?
 Naruto!
 Shut up!
 I'll knock him flat next time!
 Ha! That from someonewho just got whipped.
 Hey…what's your problem?!Naruto, you!
 You saw it, didn't you? His hand…
 That Bushy-Brow probably did a heckof a lot of special training.
 Day after day…
 More than you have…
 That's all it is.
 Sasuke…
 Interesting…
 Hmph!
 It's starting to get interesting…the Chunin Exam!
 What's next?
 Yeah!
 All right!
 Let's go, Naruto! Sakura!
 Yeah!
 Whoaaaa!There are tons of people here!
 Are they all here to takethe Chunin Exam?
 Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba,Shino, Hinata and Rock Lee?
 So you're all here, too?
 Yeah, I'm pumped, pumped, pumped!
 Open up your eyes and watch mebecome the Hokage!

 Sasuke's Decision:Pushed to the Edge!
 There you are!
 I’m here!
 I’m returning them to you!
 So it’s a clone…
 Bastard!
 Sasuke…Uchiha…!
 Why won’t you come at me?!
 Why…
 do you flee?!
 Ready?
 Over here!
 Over here!
 Wait!
 Pass!
 Here! Good one!
 Good! Go! Go! Go!
 Power shot!
 What’re we gonna do?
 We don’t know any wall-climbingtechniques or anything…
 Y-You’re…
 This…
 It’s Gaara…
 Gaara of Sand…
 R-Run!
 Wait!
 Don’t leave me alone!
 Help me!
 I don't…
 want to be alone anymore!
 Really…
 No!
 Gaara! Please calm down!
 Yashamaru…
 No escape!
 I won’t let you escape!Sasuke Uchiha!
 You’ve gotta be kidding!What’s with that outrageous strength…?
 Are you afraid of me?
 It’s too overwhelming…
 Sasuke Uchiha! Are you afraid?Are you afraid of my existence?!
 Don’t forget…You are my prey.
 Wait!
 Why are you fixatedon me so much?
 Those eyes that know true loneliness…
 And eyes that know thatit is the world’s greatest suffering…
 I think I told you.
 That you have the same eyes as me.
 Eyes that lust for power,
 overflowing with hatredand murderous intent…
 The same as me…
 Eyes that burn to kill thosewho drove you…
 into a hell called loneliness!
 Such are your eyes.
 Okay. Just a minute.
 So you’re called Gaara…
 I don’t know what you knowabout Sasuke, but…
 It’s not good for you tospeak as though
 you perceive everything about Sasuke!
 What is it that you want to sayto him before the final round,
 by pursuing him so far?
 A battle is where…
 another’s existence and one’s ownexistence are put on the line…
 and each tries to kill the other!
 Only the winner can actually feelthe value of his own existence.
 In other words,what you want to say is…
 let’s have a killing bout andnot a match?
 Uchiha… You really shouldbe wanting it, too…
 in the depths of your soul…
 You want to confirmthe value of your existence.
 Am I really, truly powerful?
 Is my existence more powerfulthan my opponent
 who faces me with eyesfilled with intent to kill?
 What’s the matter?!
 Sasuke Uchiha!
 Are you afraid of me?!
 Your hatred and intent to kill…
 have they given way to fear?
 Is that the extent of your existence?!
 Fight me…and confirm it!
 Your value! Your existence!
 Experience it!
 If you want an answer…
 Come at me!
 I was allowed to live…
 Only…myself.
 Expressly for what reason?!
 No… I know the reason.
 The reason that man left me alivewas so he wouldn’t be tormented
 by a sense of guilt for having killedan entire clan…
 Itachi chose me as the avenger…in order to have me kill him!
 Now, let me have some fun…Sasuke Uchiha!
 I’ll finish it with one blow!
 Hurry up and die,release yourself from your misery.
 You silly old fool…
 I believe I told you…that you would die too!
 Bastard!
 Let go, you old fool!
 I will not let go!I refuse to let go…
 until I have pulled out your soul!
 At this rate…
 Gaara!
 Looks like it worked…
 I see! That’s what it was!
 That’s not possible…
 He countered Gaara’s attackin that condition?!
 I just realized the reason…why it’s so fun!
 This pain…
 To take down an opponentwho wounded me…
 and thoroughly destroy him…!
 That will make me truly feel alive!
 Gaara’s never had a single wound,but he got Gaara twice.
 Is he…a freak?!
 No…a true freak is…
 After all, the only thing Gaara istransforming is still just his right arm.
 More, more!
 What?!
 What the heck is this guy?!
 One after another…
 Here goes!
 He’s even faster!
 I can’t dodge unlessI read ahead of his movements.
 If I didn’t have these eyesI’d have died long ago.
 I can no longer use Chidori…
 Fire Style…Fire Ball Jutsu!
 So the Fire Style doesn’twork against sand…
 Not only that,this level of Jutsu won’t…
 Die!
 Apparently…it needs to be Chidori!
 Well! Your limit is two shots.That’s about it…
 This is as many Chidoriyou can shoot in one day
 with your present Chakra.
 After all, this Chidori is a techniquethat can only be used
 in conjunction with Sharinganduring actual battles.
 But using Sharingan andanother Jutsu simultaneously means
 exploding and using up the Chakrain your body all at once.
 Well! But you really areone of the more impressive ones.
 Even with my Chidori…
 If I use the Lightning Bladefour times in a day,
 I’d completely use up my Chakra.
 What would happen if I triedto use more than two shots?
 The third shot won’t be activated…
 Remember this well!
 If you try to force a Jutsu to activate…
 not only will the Jutsunot properly activate,
 but your Chakra will deplete to zero…
 And in the worst case, you’ll die!
 Even if you were to survive,absolutely nothing good will come of it.
 Especially in your case.
 What's the matter?
 Does the value of your existenceamount to only this much?
 I’ll be blunt…
 You are…weak!
 You’re too optimistic.
 And it’s because your hatredis weak!
 The power of hatred isthe power of the intent to kill!
 The power of the intent to killis the power of revenge!
 Your hatred is weaker than mine!
 Shut up…
 Do you understandthe meaning of this?!
 Shut up!
 That means that you…You are weaker than me!
 Itachi chose me to be the avenger…to have me kill him!
 I am an avenger!
 The Curse Mark again…
 Darn…! My body…
 Sasuke!

 Hey Yashamaru,what does pain feel like?
 I don’t know becauseI’ve never been injured…
 I was wondering what it’s like.
 Could it be that I’m hurt?
 I’m not bleeding, but my chest’sfelt weird for a long time.
 It feels stifled and it hurts a lot!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way

 Today's…a special day, so…
 Time to eat!
 Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?
 Fight me, here!
 What're you doing, Konohamaru?
 Very good, Naruto…
 You're the man I expected you to be.
 I didn't do anything, you know…
 Let's fight fair!
 Sorry! I've gotan orientation meeting to go to.
 An orientation meeting…?
 Cause… As of today, I'm a Ninja!
 Oh…
 Sakura!Shouldn't you be heading out soon?
 I was thinking of leaving now!
 Cha! How long are you planningto treat me like a child?!
 That's right… I'm not a studentof the academy anymore…
 I'm a Kunoichi of the Leaf Village,Sakura Haruno!
 I'm off!
 Morning, Sakura.
 Morning... Ino.
 Who would've thought you'dbe able to graduate.
 Ancient history has nothing to do with it.
 As of today,we're both full-fledged Ninjas...
 I won't lose to you anymore, Ino!
 What the--? Why are you here?
 Today's meeting is for graduates only.
 Hey, don't you see this headband?
 As of today, I'm a Ninja, too!
 How can I put it, it really suits me.
 So Naruto…was able to graduate.
 Goal!
 I won again, Sakura!
 What're you saying…?
 The tip of my foot got inone centimeter faster!
 You must be blind.
 It's Sakura.
 Oh…
 Sakura's looking at me…
 Hey, Sakura!
 Mor... morning, Sakur--
 Get outta' the way!
 M-Morning, Sasuke…
 Mind if I sit next to you?
 Hey! I'm going to sitnext to Sasuke!
 First come, first served!
 I got in the classroom sooner!
 I did!
 If that's the case,then I did!
 I was first!
 I'm sitting next to Sasuke!
 How annoying...
 Is that this year's top rookie,Sasuke Uchiha?
 Yes.
 The sole survivor of the Uchiha clan?
 Yes.
 Naruto Uzumaki, eh…
 Naruto! Don't glare at Sasuke!
 Sakura…
 Everyone's all Sasuke Sasuke.
 What's so great about this guy?!
 Just beat him up, Sasuke!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 What? Really?
 Oh! Sorry!
 Wha--?
 Whoa!
 Cha! I was planning onseizing Sasuke's first kiss!
 You jerk…Naruto! I'll kill you!
 – My mouth is rotting.– Huh? Was that my fault?
 What? I feel rage…
 Naruto…
 You…
 An accident…lt was an accident
 You are annoying!
 Yikes!
 Naruto…He's atthe center of trouble as usual.
 As of today, you all have becomefull-fledged Ninjas…
 However, you're still Genin.
 The tough part's still to come!
 From here on, you'll be in a squad of three
 and carry out your missionsunder your Jonin teachers.
 A squad of three?!
 I wonder who's going to begrouped with Sasuke.
 I don't know…
 Cha! I'll be the one groupedwith Sasuke, naturally!
 Squads of three, eh.lt'll just slow me down…
 First will be Sakura.
 And the other person…
 can be anyone other than Sasuke!
 The groups have been determined
 so that the strength ofthe groups will be balanced.
 Now for the assignments!
 Now then, next is Group Seven…
 Naruto Uzumaki!
 Sakura Haruno.
 Hooray!
 I'm with…Naruto…?
 And…Sasuke Uchiha!
 Hooray!
 I'm with…Sasuke…?
 So I'll be in a different groupfrom Naruto, huh…
 Next is Group Eight. Hinata Hyuga!
 Y-Yes…
 Kiba Inuzuka!
 Shino Aburame!
 Why is this happening…?
 Group Nine.
 Cha! Love will be victorious!
 Man…
 Why do women think thatkind of guy's so great…?
 Don't you understand, Shikamaru?
 Well, I'm not a woman…
 That's why you arenot popular among girls.
 I wouldn't want to be grouped with you.
 Group Ten. Ino Yamanaka. Shikamaru Nara.
 It appears we've beengrouped together.
 And Choji Akimichi.
 And Fatty on top of that...
 That's all for the group division.
 Iruka Sensei!
 Why does an exceptional studentlike me have to be
 in the same group with this guy?!
 Sasuke has the best gradesof the graduates.
 Naruto, you're at the bottom!
 Of course, this is how it is when tryingto balance the strength within groups.
 Just don't get in my way, loser!
 Hey, what did you say?!
 You want to fight, loser?
 Knock it off, Naruto!!
 In the afternoon,I'll introduce you to your Jonin teachers.
 You're dismissed until then!
 Sasuke!
 Where'd you go, Sasuke?
 I thought since we're in the same groupand all, we'd eat together.
 Sakuraaaa!
 Since we're in the same group and all,let's eat together!
 Why should I have to eat with you?!
 Well... we're in the same group, so…
 You're…annoying.
 Sasuke! Where are you?
 Darn! This is no fun.
 I 'm finally in the same group as Sakura…and then it's like this…
 I wonder if something good will happen…
 That's it!
 Listen up!
 As long as we're in the same group,you will follow my instructions.
 Yeah-yeah…
 She becomes a real pain in the neckwhen people try to argue with to her, so…
 Let's all go out forsome BBQ sometime.
 Oh, man…
 Hmm?
 Naruto…?
 Huh?
 Oh!
 Jerk, it's Naruto, isn't it!
 Darn! Just be quiet.
 Naruto! I won't forgive youif you hurt Sasuke!
 What happened?
 Heh! Idiot…
 So Naruto got beaten bythe one he challenged…
 Of course! Naruto's no match for Sasuke!
 No need for me to feel rushed…
 From here on out,
 I'll be in the same group asSasuke for the long haul…
 But…
 Even if I were to usemy feminine charms…
 my proportions are below average…
 All that's above average is the width of my forehead…
 What should I do…?
 Huh? No way!
 Sasuke…is looking...
 this way!
 And with such a passionate look!
 You…have a charmingly wide forehead.
 It makes me want to kiss it.
 That's what its surface area is for.
 Yeah, right…
 I'm not just some kidwho believes in fairy tales…
 There's no way.
 You…have a charmingly wide forehead.
 What?!
 It makes me want to kiss it.
 Cha! This fairy tale is for real!!
 Or that's what Naruto would say.
 I've got something to ask you.
 What?
 What do you think…of Naruto?
 He's quite at home interfering andenjoys it when I make mistakes.
 Naruto doesn't understandone thing about me…
 He just annoys me!
 All I want…is for you toaccept me, Sasuke.…
 For me to accept you…?
 I'll do anything for the sake of that.
 I was careless!
 W-Wha--?!
 Gotcha!
 I didn't think someone who couldn'tperform the Clone Jutsu properly
 could do the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 I'm…desperate, so…
 I finally know why I…
 I like Sakura so much.
 Diarrhea at a time like this?!
 What's wrong?
 I-I'll be right back…225	01:41:53:26	01:41:56:04Sasuke's so shy!
 I guess he needs toprepare himself mentally…
 That was close!
 My stomach hurt so much thatthe Jutsu was about to wear off!
 Why does my stomach haveto hurt at such a good time?!
 I'm annoying... huh…
 She said so again…
 And I transformed into Sasuke andhad got a little closer to Sakura…
 In that case…I'll play an obnoxious Sasuke …
 and make her hate him!
 Oh Sasuke,you're such a shy bad boy!
 Are you prepared? I'm raring to go!
 H-Hey, Sasuke!
 Where's Naruto?
 Oh, there you go changingthe subject again…
 Just leave Naruto alone!
 All he does is pick fights with you!
 It's because he wasn't raised right!
 You know!
 He doesn't have any parents, right?
 He always selfishly does whatever he wants!
 My parents would get mad at meif I did something like that!
 There are no parents to nag youif it's just you alone!
 So his selfishness comesout at various times!
 The loneliness.
 Huh?
 It's something worse than gettingscolded by parents and...
 W-What's gotten into you…?
 You…
 annoy me.
 Darn! It finally stopped!
 I wonder if Sakura's still waiting.
 W-What are you doing here?!
 I used the Escape Jutsu,the very basic of techniques.
 Oh...
 What were you planning to do…
 by transforming into me?!
 I thought it'd be fun, so I gave it a try!
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu again?!
 I'll show you that I'm really amazing!
 I'll defeat you…
 and make you accept me!
 Prepare yourself, Sasuke!
 Just like that, my stomach again…
 B-Bathroom!
 I'm first, I say!
 I'm first, I say.
 I'm about to go in my pants, I say!
 How stupid!
 ""You annoy me"" …huh?
 I see. So this is howNaruto must've felt…
 I wonder if I can…be a bit more nice next time…
 Darn.
 Did I eat something bad?
 Naruto…
 Smile…Smile…
 Let's go back to the classroom, Naruto.
 Sakura…
 Payback for earlier, huh?
 Sasuke's turned himself into Sakura…
 You're trying to trick me, right, Sasuke?!
 I don't think so!
 Ow-ow-ow…What the heck is going on?!
 Oh…
 You idiot, Naruto!
 So, this is Naruto's room…
 And Sasuke of the Uchiha clan is also in the group you'll be in charge of.
 I wish you good luck!
 The expiration date…
 of this milk has passed quite awhile ago…
 He'll get sick if he drink this.
 It seems like that things aregoing to get disastrous.
 What the heck is going on?!
 What is going on?!
 This isn't the same Kakashi Senseifrom yesterday.
 Is this really the same Kakashi Sensei
 who got caught in my trapand breezily came late?
 Darn it! Darn it!
 No way am I giving up!
 I'll defeat him and clearthis super difficult testl!
 No way am I going back now!

106,"Connecting old wordsthat have been used up
 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with  youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 Not yet? Idate hasn’t come, yet?
 My lord, we finally found evidence
 regarding the matterwe were investigating.
 Oh, I see.
 Mm, good work.
 My lord, is there something amiss?
 No, it’s nothing.
 Concentrate on my Chakra.
 We’re saved.
 Sasuke, are you okay?
 Naruto, I’m counting on you.
 Protect Idate.
 The Last Leg:A Final Act of Desperation
 Poison needles won’t work on me.
 How dare you do thatto Sasuke and Sakura?!
 Rest easy.
 I’ll send you to the placewhere they are real soon.
 I won’t go so easily!
 Naruto.
 But what do I do?
 The Rasenganwon’t work on his sword.
 It doesn’t matter.
 Those two are waiting for my help!
 Saving each other again, huh?!
 They wouldn’t survivefalling off this cliff.
 Shut up!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 Oh…you’re going to run awayfrom here using such a diversion?
 Don’t mess with me!Who’s going to run away?
 Naruto, it’s futile.That technique won’t work on that sword!
 It’s futile!
 Naruto!
 Just like the Uchiha loser earlier,
 why is it that each and everyLeaf Village Ninja is an idiot?
 Shut up!
 I’m going to save those two!
 Are you seriously thinkingthey’re alive after falling off this cliff?
 You should’ve gotten out of here.
 As if…
 I'd abandon my comradesand run away!
 That’s my answer to the tenth problem!
 What’re you saying?
 One more time.
 Eat this.
 Idiot.
 Rasengan!
 Naruto…!
 You still don’t get it?!You don’t have a chance of winning!
 Damn!
 That's…
 the damage Sasuke inflicted.
 That's it!
 If I aim for that…
 I can win!
 You saying you still want to fight?Give it up, already!
 Shut up! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke gave me a chance!I won't waste it!
 Naruto…
 Stay still!
 Sasuke! They’re usingthe Water Clone Jutsu!
 I know!
 Trust us, Idate!We’ll protect you, no matter what!
 S-Sakura…
 Go on ahead.We’ll be right behind you.
 Sakura!
 I…
 I hate people who don’t knowwhen to quit.
 This is the end.
 A foolish cheap trick.
 What?!
 I’m saying I can’t stand thissaving each other business.
 Idate!
 Your opponent is over here!
 Above!
 Rasengan!
 What?!
 It can’t be!
 Naruto, you did it!
 Naruto…
 You’re really something.
 Yeah, well…
 Sakura!
 Naruto…! Idate…!
 Sakura!
 She’s okay?
 Sasuke’s okay, too.
 I’m coming to save you now,believe it.
 Idiot. Forget about us andget going to the finish line, quick!
 Oh, that’s right.
 But what should we do about this?
 Leave it to me.
 We’ll cut the rope and goto the opposite bank in one swing!
 I get it!
 I thought the worst of myself.
 But Boss Jirocho trusted in me.
 I trust you more than anyone.
 It was the first timeI was trusted by someone.
 So I wanted to win this racefor the boss, no matter what.
 But in reality, I can’t winjust with such feelings.
 So many times along the way,I felt like giving up.
 Watch out!
 But each time,
 you guys risked your livesto save a lame duck like me!
 Naruto, I’m sorry.
 I should’ve trusted you guysfrom the start.
 What’re you saying?
 Say stuff like thatafter winning the race.
 You’re right.
 Naruto!
 Idate!
 Okay, do it!
 Right!
 Boo! Boo! Boo!
 Now that's a rousing welcome.
 Naruto, at this rate,we’ll crash into the rocks!
 I know. Leave it to me!
 Release Chakra fromthe bottom of my feet.
 It’s the very last Chakra!
 Then stick tothe rocks with Chakra!
 All right, Naruto!
 Now dash to the finish line!
 Sakura, I’ll come backto help you right away!
 Okay. Let’s go, Idate.
 Right!
 Run steady, Fukusuke!
 Stay sharp until the end.
 Shut up! I know.
 Geez…spoiling my good mood.
 I can see the Todoroki Great Shrine.
 Boss!
 Blast it!
 Good, good.
 Idate.
 – Hey! 					– Oh!
 Hey! What’s that?
 Here he comes!
 Idate of the Wasabi Family’s here!
 Go!
 You can still catch up!
 What?!
 Idate!
 Idiot!
 What’re you doing, Fukusuke?! Run!
 Damn it!
 I won’t lose.
 I will not lose!
 I won’t give up until the very end!
 Like heck. I won’t be passed upafter I've come this far!
 – All right!– He caught up.
 Blast this guy…!
 I won’t lose, you little…!
 Blast…
 Idate…!
 Come on, Idate!
 Boss!
 Go! Idate…!
 All right!
 I did it!
 Idate.
 You ran a fine race.
 Boss!
 You did well.
 Boss, I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry.
 You fool. What’re you apologizing for?
 You won.
 No, please let me speak.
 I really want to apologize now.I’m truly sorry!
 You're making no sense to me.What a totally weird guy.
 Well done, Idate.
 I was wrong about you.
 Okay, Idate.Go receive the winner’s blessing.
 Yes!
 Hey, Idate!
 Hey, you idiot!
 Bringing shame upon the boss!You’re prepared, aren’t you?
 I-I’m sorry!
 The winner!
 Idate Morino of the Wasabi Family!
 He finally did it.
 Hey, hey… Just a minute.
 Kyuroku.
 Along the way, he rodeon the back of a hired Ninja.
 This is a violation.
 W-What?
 There’s proof.
 Look at this photo.
 Racing until the end on your own strengthis the rule of this race.
 Therefore, Idate is disqualified.
 The winner is Fukusuke Hikyakuyaof the Wagarashi Family.
 No way.
 H-Hold it. That was…!
 I’ll hear no excuses!Jirocho, it’s a promise.
 I order the Wasabi Familydissolved immediately.
 Just a minute.
 There is no such rule anywhere.Do not speak nonsense!
 M-My lord!
 Or perhaps…
 you have a reason for wantingthe Wagarashi to win at all cost?
 No, nothing like that.
 Could it be because you wouldnot be able to do things like this?
 Look.
 You fool!Retire and enter the monastery!
 Yes, yes, my lord!
 Kyuroku Wagarashi.
 Y-Yes?
 Word of your evil deedshas reached my ears as well.
 Your sins against the peopleof Degarashi Port are severe.
 Therefore, the Wagarashi Familyis to be dissolved as of today.
 Understood?
 Y-Yes, sire.
 Today is an auspicious day.
 With this, the matter is settled.
 Thanks for the help, Naruto.
 Idate, this is good-bye, huh?
 I’ve come to get the wounded.
 Ibiki.
 B-Big Brother!
 Where are the wounded?
 Over here.
 Okay, get him on the boat, quickly.
 R-Right.
 Um, excuse me.
 What is it?
 N-Nothing.
 Brother!
 Wait, Big Brother!
 Who are you?
 The man who called meBig Brother died three years ago.
 Big Brother… I figured outthe answer to the tenth problem!
 I’ll never betray a comrade again!
 I can trust others now!
 He's looking good now.
 'Bye, Idate. Let’s meet again.
 Good-bye. See you around.
 Yeah. You guys come again, too, okay?
 I wish you good health, Boss!
 Yeah…
 See ya!
 Take care!
 An interesting guy as always.
 No wonder the Fifth Hokagesees potential in him.
 Naruto! Thanks!
 Idate! Next time,it’ll be a battle with me, believe it.
 Sasuke, does it hurt?
 No.
 Thank goodness.
 Those wounds will heal immediatelyonce we get back to the village.
 Right.
 The rumors were true.
 The survivor ofthe village’s honorable Uchiha Clan…
 is just a good-for-nothing kid…
 I couldn’t beat him!
 And yet, he…
 that Naruto...!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a personbroken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around (round around)
 Shake shake shakeLet’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain

 Hey Sasuke and Naruto,what's happened to both of you?
 This is a hospital,and Sasuke's still recuperating!
 Even you should know better, Naruto.
 Stop the antics already!
 Why, why's this happening?!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Sasuke here at Point B!
 Sakura here at Point C!
 Naruto here. I'm at Point A!
 You're slow, Naruto!
 Okay, the seventh squad…
 Hm?!
 The target has moved!
 Follow it!
 Alright! It's over there!
 What's your distancefrom the target?
 Five meters!I can go at anytime!
 I'm ready, too!
 Me, too…!
 Okay…
 Do it!
 Uryaaah!
 I got him!
 Does he have the ribbonon his right ear…?
 Are you sure it's our target Tora?
 It's the target, no mistake.
 Alright, the mission to capturelost pet ""Tora"" is complete!
 Isn't there a missionwith a greater sense of urgency?!
 A Dangerous Mission!Journey to the Land of Waves!
 Ohhh! My cute Tora!I was worried to death!
 The Wife of the Land of Fire's Daimyo(Feudal Lord)		Madame Shijimi and Tora (the Cat)
 Serves him right, that stupid cat!
 No wonder he ran away…
 …Now, then!
 The next mission forKakashi's seventh squad is…
 An errand to the neighboring town…to baby-sit the chief Councilor's boy…
 Helping with diggingfor potatoes, eh…
 Nooooo!
 No! No, thank you!
 As for me,
 I want to do likea more exciting mission!
 Give us something else!
 He's got a point…
 Man… He's a pain!
 I thought it was about timefor him to get fretful…
 You fool!You're still bottom rookie!
 At the start,
 everyone moves upthe ladder
 by gaining experiencefrom simple missions!
 B-But!
 It's been nothingbut blah missions so far!
 Knock it off!
 Naruto!
 It's necessary to explain to youwhat a mission is…
 Listen to me!
 Requests pour into the villageevery day.
 They range from babysittingto assassinations…
 A wide spectrum of requests arerecorded on the request list…
 They are separated into A, B, C,and D ranks in order of difficulty.
 In the village,everyone below me
 is divided up by ability in the order ofJonin, Chunin, and Genin.
 We at the highest level distributethe requests as missions
 to Ninjas who have abilitiesthat suit said mission.
 And, if the mission is successful,the fee comes in from the client.
 Nevertheless, you guyshave just become Genin…
 rank D is aboutthe best you can do…
 Hm?!
 Yesterday's lunch was pork-bonebroth noodles,
 so today will be miso broth…
 Listen!
 I-I'm sorry.
 Maaaan!You always lecture me, old man!
 But I'm not that little pranksterthat you think I am!
 Humph!
 Maaan, I'm going to get scolded later…
 This kid who could onlyexpress himself with pranks…
 Okay, fine!
 Huh…?!
 If you insist…
 I'll have you do a Rank C mission…
 You'll be bodyguards for someone.
 Really?!
 Ah-ha!
 Who? Who?
 A feudal lord?!
 Or, a princess?!
 Don't get so hasty.
 I'll introduce you now!
 Could you please come in…?
 Huh…?!
 What's this? It's just a bunchof darned squirts!
 Huh…?
 Particularly you, the smallest onewith the idiot face.
 Are you really a Ninja?
 Who's the smallest one withthe idiot face he's talking about…?
 What?!
 I'll kill him!!
 What good will it do tokill the old man
 you're supposed to beguarding, you moron?!
 I'm Tazuna,veteran bridge builder.
 You'll be risking life and limbin guarding me to the max
 until I return to my land andcomplete my bridge!
 All right!
 We're off!!
 What're you so excited about?!
 You see, I've never leftthe village before!
 Hey! Am I really okay with this squirt?!
 I'm a Jonin. I'll be watching him.There's no need to worry.
 ...okay with this squirt?!
 Anyone but this old dude, man…
 He's really the worst client!
 I'll tell him a thing or two…
 Hey, old man!
 Don't be mocking Ninjasso much!
 I'm awesome, you see!
 I'm a super-elite Ninja whowill be called Hokage one day!
 My name's Naruto Uzumaki.
 Remember it well!!
 The Hokage's the super top-dogNinja in the village, right?
 You sure as heck don't seem likeyou could become the Hokage…
 Aaah! Shut up!
 I'm prepared to do whateverit takes to become the Hokage!
 You'll have no choicebut to acknowledge me then!!
 I'll never acknowledge you, squirt…
 Even if you become the Hokage!
 What?! I'll kill you!
 I told you to stop it, you moron!
 No! At least let me haveone shot, just one…
 Say…Mr.Tazuna…?
 What is it?
 Your country is ""The Land of the Waves,""  right?
 What of it?
 Say, Kakashi Sensei…
 Are there Ninjas in that land, too?
 No, there aren't Ninjas inthe Land of the Waves…
 But in other nations, while culturesand customs are different,
 hidden villages exist,and there are Ninjas there.
 To the many nations on the continent,
 the existence of Shinobi Villages isa measure of the nation's military strength.
 In other words,
 that is how these nations maintaintheir relationships with neighboring nations.
 Even so, the villages are notunder the control of the nations.
 They are equal in rank.
 On a small island likethe Land of the Waves,
 where it is difficult to beinfluenced by other nations,
 there is no needfor a Shinobi village.
 Among the respective nationsthat possess a Shinobi Village,
 the five nations of ""Fire,"" ""Water,""""Lightning,"" ""Wind,"" and ""Earth,""
 due to their large territory andimmeasurable power,
 are called the ""Five Great Nations.""
 The Village Hidden in the Leavesof the Land of Fire,
 the Village Hidden in the Mistof the Land of Water,
 the Village Hidden in the Cloudsof the Land of Lightning,
 the Village Hidden in the Sandof the Land of Wind,
 the Village Hidden in the Rocksof the Land of Earth.
 Only the leaders ofeach of these Hidden Villages
 are allowed to havethe name of Kage, the Shadow.
 The ""Hokage""(Fire shadow),""
 ""Mizukage"" 					(Water Shadow),
 ""Raikage""(Lightning Shadow),
 ""Kazekage"" 					(Wind Shadow),
 ""Tsuchikage""(Earth Shadow),
 the so-calledFive Kage (shadows),
 reign supreme overthe tens of thousands of Ninjas
 in each nationof the whole world.
 No kidding…Lord Hokage is that incredible!
 I wonder if that blah old manis really that incredible…
 Sounds fishy!
 That can't be true! No way!
 Hey!
 You guys just doubtedLord Hokage now, didn't you…?
 Well…don't worry.
 There are no Ninja battlesin Rank C missions.
 Then, there's no worry of gettinginto a scrape with foreign Ninjas…!
 Of course, not.
 What?!
 Huh?!
 W-What?
 The first one!
 K-Kakashi Sensei!
 The second one…
 The second one…
 Ohhh…!
 Hm?!
 It doesn't come off!
 W…Wow!!
 Whoa!
 Ugh!!
 They'll come!
 I have to do it…I have to!!
 Get back, sir!!
 Yo…
 Kakashi Sensei…! He's alive!
 Humph! 					Show off…
 Whaa--?!
 Then, what was that…?
 So Kakashi Sensei…used Substitutions…
 Naruto…Sorry I didn't help you right away…
 I got you hurt.
 I didn't think you'd beincapable of moving…
 I was saved, somehow…
 Anyhow, let me just say,good job, Sasuke.
 You, too, Sakura.
 I…couldn't do anything…
 but Sasuke…
 It was his first real battle…
 Didn't he feel scared, at all?
 He saved me like it was nothing andwithout getting any dirt on his clothes…
 Hey…
 Huh?!
 Are you hurt…
 scaredy cat...?
 Sasuke!
 Naruto!
 These guys have poisonon their claws.
 You need totake out the poison quickly.
 What?!
 You have to open the wound anddrain the poisoned blood.
 Don't move so much.
 The poison will spread.
 By the way, Mr. Tazuna…
 W-What is it…?!
 I have somethingto talk to you about.
 Chunin from theVillage Hidden in the Mist…
 These guys are Ninjas known forcontinuing to fight
 no matter what the sacrifice.
 How were you ableto detect our movements?
 There probably wouldn't be puddles of water
 on a clear day like today,when it hasn't rained for days.
 Knowing that, why'd you leave itto the kids to fight?
 If I felt like it,I could kill these guys instantly…
 But… 					I had to know...
 who the targetof these enemies was…
 Hm?! What do you mean?
 In other words...
 what I mean is I had to knowif it was you,
 or one of us Shinobi…who was being targeted.
 We haven't heard anything aboutyou being targeted by Ninjas.
 The content of the request wassupposed to just be
 protection from gangs,thieves, and the like…
 This is a mission witha B rank or higher.
 The request was supposed to be
 for backup protectionuntil you finished building your bridge…
 If our enemies were to be Ninjas,
 the mission would've beenestimated without question
 as an expensive ""B Rank""  mission.
 It appears there's some kindof good reason for this,
 but being lied to in the requestwon't do.
 This is beyond the scopeof our mission.
 This mission is too soon for us…
 Let's give it up!
 We need an anesthetic toopen Naruto's wound
 and get out the poisoned blood…
 We have to return to the villageand take him to a doctor…
 Hmmm…
 Hm? What...?!
 This sure is a burden!
 Since we need to treat Naruto's wound,shall we go back to the village…?
 Huh!
 Oh!
 Why am I so different?!
 Why's it always me…Darn it!
 Naruto! What're you doing?!
 I should be getting stronger…
 Here I'm steadily carryingout missions and
 doing special-skill trainingby myself every day…
 I'll never get into another situationfrom which I'll have to be rescued.
 I'll never be afraidor a be a coward…
 I won't lose to Sasuke…
 I'm going to swear onthe pain of my left hand!
 I'll protect you, old man…with this Kunai knife!!
 The mission continues!!
 Naruto…
 It's all well and good torid yourself of the poisoned blood,
 but any more than that andyou'll bleed to death.
 Things will get hairy if you don'tstop the bleeding quick... Seriously!
 Yikes!
 Argh! No! No!
 I can't die like this, I say!
 Show me your hand.
 Nooo! Help me!!
 Naruto!
 You're really self-abusive,aren't you!
 That's masochistic!
 The wound is…
 already starting to heal…
 Um…um…
 Am I okay?You look awfully serious…
 Well…You should be okay.
 Is it…the power ofthe Nine-Tailed Fox…?
 Did you say you failed?!
 I paid a lot of money to hireyou guys
 because you saidyou were once hot-shot Ninjas!
 Stop your darned grumbling…!!
 Next time, I'll kill him with this…head chopper!
 I-It's really okay, right?!
 It seems that the enemyhas hired good Ninjas…
 On top of that, a tightened guardon account of the Demon Brothers' failure
 means that it won't be easy…
 Just who do you think I am?!
 This Zabuza Momochi,who is called the demon of…
 the Hidden Mist!!
 We've finally landed ashorein the Land of the Waves.
 The guys before wereall well and good,
 but there should be evenstronger guys lying in wait.
 Okay! I'm going to regainmy honor and continue the mission.
 No matter what enemy comes,
 I'll protect the old manthis time around for sure.
 Oh, they wasted no time.
 An impressive-looking guy witha huge Katana has come.

 This many Paper Bombs…is a diversion?
 Y-Yes!
 No way…
 No. He’s a man whowould go that far…
 After all, he is Gennothe Trapper!
 Remember. Think.His actions thus far…
 His intent hidden in there.
 First he steals the blueprintsfor key facilities in the village
 and pretends to blow himself upin front of the Anbu Black Ops.
 Because of the incident,
 an S-Level EmergencySecurity Alert is given…
 The village becomes poorly manned…
 and Genno is able tomove around as he pleases…
 Then why did he scatterthe blueprints he stole?
 With this incident, it becomes evidentthat Genno might still be alive
 so the guys on watch outsideend up returning
 to the village as quickly possible…
 Could that have been his objective?
 He directed everyone’s attentionto the Paper Bombs
 and reassembledthe village Shinobi.
 If his aim is toset up something there…
 Could it be…?
 The Paper Bombs in the villagewere a decoy?
 You can’t see the Paper Bombsin this room?
 What’s this?!
 What’s up with these Paper Bombs?
 Do you know the geological conditions
 of the Great Stone Faces?
 G-Geological conditions…?
 To be precise, the geological conditionof this plateau
 which the Great Stone Facesare carved into.
 The plateau towering behindthe Village Hidden in the Leaves
 is made of extremely hard rock.
 But this rock has narrow linesrunning through it, you see…
 It can be easily broken if poweris applied along those lines.
 The Great Stone Faceswere created using this…
 This time and thirty years ago
 aren’t the only times I’ve cometo the Leaf…
 I’ve visited the Leaf several timesand checked things out…
 And then I finally determined it…
 I determined how to set Paper Bombsto destroy this plateau!
 Wha--?!
 I’m fairly certainno one would imagine
 the destruction ofthe Great Stone Faces…
 Especially when
 we’re in the middle of Paper Bombremoval operations.
 We wouldn't even thinkabout the Great Stone Faces…
 But if that entire plateau wereto slide down and crumble…
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 would be completely buriedin earth and sand!
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 It would be destroyed!
 Choji, contact the Fifth Hokageimmediately!
 Make sure the guys who returndon’t enter the village…
 Shikamaru, be happy!
 Guy Sensei and the othershave come back!
 Hurry, hurry!Now that Might Guy has returned,
 we won’t let the enemy doas he pleases!
 Too late, huh…?
 What’s the matter…?
 Shikamaru!
 Naruto has…!
 Why…? Why destroythe whole village…?
 If you do that,many innocent people will die.
 And all the buildings you builtwill be destroyed.
 Is that what you want?!
 You may think revenge isyour last job or whatever,
 but something likethis is absolutely mistaken.
 If you’re going to go throughwith this no matter what…
 I’ll stop you!
 That’s impossible.
 No way will I let you detonatethe Paper Bombs!
 Nope. I won from the momentyou set foot in here.
 Even if you defeat me,
 the triggering device will activatethe instant you leave this place.
 It seems everyone has returned…
 I guess I’ll be activatingthe triggring device…
 The Village Hidden in the Leavesshall meet
 the same fate as Heat Devil Village!
 I won’t let that happen!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 It’s over!
 It’s useless to resist…
 It’s impossible for you aloneto disarm all of my traps.
 No doubt, it might be impossiblefor me alone…
 but I’ve got friends!
 But didn’t you do nothingbut badmouth them at Ichiraku?
 Yeah. I get in fights with them a lotand they tick me off sometimes…
 But they’re my friends!
 They’re Shinobiwho will protect the Leaf with me!
 No matter what traps you set…
 they’ll manage somehow,no matter what!
 Then, I’ll finish everything before that.
 You won't be able to stop them this time!
 Fang Over Fang…!
 I’d say that was a close shave, huh?
 Kiba! Akamaru!How’d you know I was here…?
 Thank Hinata!
 She thought it was strange thatyou’d leave for no reason,
 so she frantically searchedfor you with her Byakugan.
 But the Byakugan shouldn’tbe that versatile…
 I'm surprised you found us…
 Well, we had a pretty good ideaof where you were…
 Shikamaru said that the final trapwould be in the Great Stone Faces.
 Shikamaru did…?
 I see…
 This means I shouldn’t takeyoung opponents lightly, huh…?
 Right. You misjudged our power…
 Th-These are…insects?!
 That’s right…You’re finished now.
 Get down, you two!
 Old man…
 He blew himself up!
 No, that’s not it!
 It’s a Substitution…
 It seems he switched just beforebeing covered with the insects…
 It’s over now…
 Wh-What’s this…?
 It’s the Shadow Strangle Jutsu…
 You anticipated my actions…?
 Yup. Checkmate, old man.Come on right over here…
 Choji, restrain him.
 Got it…
 Oh, shoot! His shadow…!
 Shikamaru… What did he do…?
 He had set it so a smoke screenwould activate
 if he were touched by an enemy.
 Choji, to the right!
 Human Boulder!
 The Leaf is now finished!
 A strike?
 Why won't…the Paper Bomb explode?
 Tough luck…
 We already disarmed that Paper Bomb.
 And we disarmed allthe triggering devices
 set inside the Great Stone Faces.
 This is as far as you go old man…
 That’s right…Prepare yourself!
 It’s useless to run!
 I don’t know how incredible ofa Trapper you are.
 But my friends’ teamworkis better than you are!
 I must not give up here…
 Give up, already!
 No matter what you set up,we’ll stop it!
 I wouldn’t be able…to show my face to my son…
 Where’d he…?
 Over there!
 It seems you haven’t disarmedall of the triggering devices…
 I…win!
 The village!
 Don’t be fooled, guys!This is a Genjutsu!
 Release!
 Naruto!
 Huh? Wh-What?
 Summoning Jutsu!
 He's planning to get on that birdand escape!
 Leave it to me!
 Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 All right! It’s a success…
 – Ino…! 					– Hey!
 Why’d you break the Jutsu?!
 What’s the matter?
 His body… It really hurt…
 He’s fighting while enduringa lot of pain in his body!
 I won’t let you escape!
 Naruto…
 Sure enough…
 I’m no match for a young personat Taijutsu, huh…?
 It’s not like that…
 You’re a quite the practitionerof Taijutsu…
 Now it’s finally over!
 It’s not over yet…
 What?
 What do you mean…it’s not over yet?
 Where’s the bird he summoned earlier?
 Oh! Over there!
 There are Paper Bombs on its feet!
 What?!
 The Mountainside Image ofthe Third Hokage is the spot
 where I restored a crack…
 I used a device differentfrom the others…
 That cracked section is slightlymore fragile than the other areas…
 I set an triggering devicethat takes advantage of that…
 If there an explosion occurs there,
 the other Paper Bombswill explode at once.
 Going so far as to set a devicein such a place…
 To think we overlooked that…!
 That means he summonedthat bird to activate the device?!
 At last…my wish will come true…
 Here it comes!
 I'll use this…
 It dodged them!
 We can’t bring it down witha long-range attack?!
 I’ll defend the Leaf,no matter what!
 I’ll blow him away with the Rasenganbefore he slams into this place!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 What?!
 What?!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!Both arms!
 Naruto, use my hands!
 Thanks, Choji!
 H-Hinata?!
 U-Umm…Shikamaru told me to readthat bird’s movements
 with my Byakuganand to give you directions…
 Huh…?
 I leave the rest to you!
 All right, let’s go, Hinata!
 R-Right!
 Byakugan!
 Not yet… Draw it closer…
 It’ll be okay.
 No matter what,
 I’ll protect the village the Third Hokagerisked his life to protect!
 Naruto… Now!
 Rasengan!
 It vanished?!
 Up above!
 Damn it. Reach!
 You little!
 What? Did something happen…?
 All right!
 Yes! We did it, Hinata!
 N-Naruto…
 The inside of his bodyis in terrible shape…
 It’s amazing that he lived until today.
 Old man…
 It’s too bad…I failed to leave my name in history…
 But…I had…fun…
 What?
 What do you mean, old man?!
 What do you mean you had fun?!
 Old Man Genno!
 Naruto? 					No, it’s not…
 “My son proud as a peacock havingbeaten me at treasure hunting…”
 Treasure hunting…?
 Did you notice…?
 Huh?
 The Leaf didn't suffer a single casualtyin this incident…
 Old Man Genno!Open your eyes!
 Old Man Genno!!
 I figured it out, Shikamaru…
 It seems the person in this pictureis Genno’s real son…
 Son…?
 It seems he becamea Shinobi like his father…
 but lost his life right after thatwhen the Leaf invaded Heat Devil Village.
 I bet he wanted to avenge his own son…
 So he did something like this…
 No doubt, at first he may haveinfiltrated the village for revenge…
 At first…?
 Something was kind of bugging me,
 so I checked out the triggering devicethat was set in the Academy
 one more time.
 There was a loose connectionin one spot.
 It was set up so it wouldn’t activateeven if the target were hit…
 Wasn’t that just Genno’s mistake…?
 Genno was a first-rate Trapper.
 It’s unlikely he’d make sucha simple mistake…
 No doubt about it…
 The same goes for the traps inthe Great Stone Faces…
 There were some defective bombsmixed in with the Paper Bombs.
 Even if the traps were activated,
 there's a strong possibility that
 they'd only make a few cracksin the Great Stone Faces.
 Then he had no serious intentionof smashing the Leaf?
 Then…for what purpose…?
 Treasure hunting…
 What do you mean treasure hunting?
 It makes more senseto think of it like that.
 In other words, he infiltratedthe village for the sake of revenge,
 but he changed his mindafter meeting Naruto
 who was a spitting imageof his son…
 He probably knew thathe didn’t have long to live.
 If he was going to do somethingbefore dying,
 he wanted it to bethe thing he found most fun…
 He probably wanted to re-enacthis treasure-hunts with his son…
 using the traps he set to smash the Leaf.
 So that’s what it was.
 Well, it’s just conjecture, though.
 So that old man…wasn’t a bad person…
 I told you from the start.
 Those who like Ichiraku's ramencan't be bad people!
 What? But in actuality,didn’t he hate ramen?
 Ichiraku ramen is different!
 There’s no way you can keepeating something you hate every day.
 Exactly!
 Old man…
 Naruto…?
 The enemies who come to the Leafwon’t always be like this.
 Someone like Orochimarumight attack again!
 That means we mustalways be prepared!
 Right!
 It’s a pain, though…
 I’ll eat in preparation for that!
 We’ll protect the Leaf Village!
 With all of us working together…
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say,“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!!Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key

 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feelin my undeveloped chest,

 We're going to look back atall the Ninja best battles!!

 Look forward to it! Cha!
 By the way, who's our guest?

 For a start, wake upthat medium kid.
 It will release that Jutsu!
 How do we go about waking him?!
 Give him a good punch!
 But with that said…
 I’m not particularly goodat transformations…
 Huh?
 So you will act as my willand make the Sign!
 Time for a combined transformation!
 We got to have fangs and claws!Let’s go!
 Transform!
 Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light
 F-Fox…?
 What a battle…
 I can’t call this place safe either, huh…
 Darn it!
 His power is increasingmore and more!
 Chief! We got to hurry up and rousethat guy out of his sleep!
 I know that!
 Here goes…!
 Go to hell!
 All right! Now!
 Okay!
 Wake the hell up!
 You jerk…
 All right!
 Not that much time has passedsince the medium went to sleep!
 In that state,one blow should be enough!
 Darn!
 It hasn’t been long since I emerged!
 The Jutsu has been dissolved!
 Even if the Playing Possum Jutsuis dissolved,
 he’s still putting on the pressure?
 That guy interfered with my Jutsu…?!
 Sand Coffin!
 – Pop! 					– Yeah!
 It’s the chief’s tongue…
 Don’t take me for a fool!
 Darn!
 What kind of strengthdoes this guy possess?
 This doesn’t look good…!
 Both Naruto and I have alreadycompletely disgorged our Chakra!
 You will be killed by me!I will not cease to exist!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 Besides just the Sound Ninja,I wouldn’t have imagined that
 this many of the Sand Joninwould enter into the village, too!
 Well, it’s understandable.This is what is called war.
 It’s taking much too long.
 It’s impossible for a battlebetween Shinobi to last this long.
 What the heck is happening inside?
 You’re still grabbing my arm…
 I can’t use my Jutsu this way…
 Come on,let go of me once and for all.
 I’m not letting your ambitionsinterfere with the village…any longer…
 There’s no stopping my ambitions!You will die here!
 You old dotard…
 As the Third Hokage,
 are you saying you still havethe power to save this village?
 Do you understand…the current situation?!
 Many Hidden Sand Shinobi andmy subordinates
 have infiltrated this village.
 Your side…the Leaf Shinobi…
 will be annihilated down toevery last woman and child!
 I will accomplish the destructionof the Hidden Leaf Village!
 It’s empty inside!
 There’s nobody there!
 That’s very strange…
 Huh?
 Why is there so little resistancewhen we’ve closed in
 all the way to the centerof the Hidden Leaf Village?
 That’s…
 And also…there’s not one womanor child in sight.
 What is the reason for that?
 Huh?!
 Konohamaru…?
 What’s the matter, Konohamaru?
 I gotta use the toilet.
 M-Me too…
 I do too…
 K-Konohamaru…!
 This is an emergency situation!
 If the enemy finds us,it will cost us!
 Go back to the other roomand stay quiet!
 I-It’s not that… I gotta pee!
 Hold it!
 I don’t think I can hold it…
 Gimme a break.ln that case, come along with me…
 Can't hold it!
 Can't! Can't hold…!
 That’s…
 At last, huh…
 I’ll get revenge for youno matter what…
 Hayate.
 That’s the signal. Let’s go!
 Roger!
 You don’t get it, do you, Orochimaru?
 Don’t underestimate the Shinobiof this Village!
 Are you all right?
 Yeah…
 Is that…the last?
 Yes, the evacuation is complete!
 W-What’s happening?
 The Village Hidden in the Leaveshas an instruction manual
 outlining what to do in case ofa sneak attack by the enemy.
 Step One:Eliminate the enemy’s sneak attack force.
 In case one is unableto eliminate them,
 proceed immediately to Step Two.
 The immediate evacuationof noncombatants!
 Evacuate the women and childrento shelters around the village!
 When that has been completed,proceed to Step Three!
 Step Three…?
 Through the collective strengthand efforts of the Village,
 eliminate the enemy!
 In that case…!
 The counteroffensive…starts now!
 We will not allow you to takeeven one step beyond this point!
 Sakura!
 Rescue Sakura,if it’s the last thing you do!
 I’ll protect Sakura no matter what!
 You will be killed by me.I will not cease to exist.
 My back is against the wall…
 I have to hurry upand stop that Demon Raccoon…
 Please…
 Just a small amount is fine…
 Give me…
 some Chakra!
 What are you doing…?There’s only one opponent!
 Hyuga is the magnum forceof the Leaf Village.
 Don’t forget that!
 M-My…body…is immobilized…
 Is this the first timeyou’re experiencing
 the Leaf’s hidden technique,Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?
 Well, take this too while I’m at it…
 The Leaf’s hidden technique…Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu!
 W-What’s this?!
 My body is…all on its own…!
 S-Stop…
 Stop!
 Reminds me of the old days!
 Yeah!
 The original Ino-Shika-Cho Trio reunites!
 Kuromaru…let’s go!
 Right!
 In order to protect the village,
 all the Leaf Shinobi will risktheir lives fighting!
 Real strength doesn't liein the mastering of all Jutsu!
 The poison in my body is…
 Don’t move, Shino.I inserted my Parasitic Insects.
 They are removing the poison.
 Dad…
 I believe I taught thisto you too, in the past…
 It is when one protectssomeone important…
 that the true strength ofthe Shinobi will emerge!
 I will protect everyone!
 Here I come! You idiot raccoon!
 Die…!
 Darn…
 Darn it!
 D-Did he win…?
 A simple head blow…
 His manner of fightingis incredibly clumsy,
 but to think that he could squeeze outChakra at that critical stage.
 I’ve never seen a knucklehead Ninjalike him before, but…
 he sure is the first phenomenal kidI’ve seen in a long time.
 It’s too bad that I can’t see this throughto the end,
 but I’ve reached my limit.
 Gamakichi, let’s head home!
 Okay! Pop!
 As might be expected, even I…am empty now…
 You are too, aren’t you?
 We’re much alike…let’s make this time the last!
 It appears that…
 I don’t have the strength leftto yank out your entire soul.
 However, your ambition ends here!
 Not yet!
 There’s no stopping my ambition!
 I have a suitable punishment for you
 who have become addicted to the Jutsuand who have overindulged in the Jutsu!
 I will take all your Jutsu away with me!
 What did you say?!
 There!
 Don’t tell me that..?
 Stop that!
 Seal!
 My…My arms…
 Now…you can no longer useeither of your arms.
 And since you can’t use your arms,you can’t weave Signs.
 You no longer possess Ninjutsu!
 Your ambition of crushingthe Hidden Leaf…dies right here!
 You old dotard!Give me back my arms!
 Orochimaru, you fool…
 It’s unfortunate thatwe can’t leave together,
 but, my disciple…
 let’s meet in the other world one day.
 You old dotard…whose life is hanging by a thread!
 How dare you!How dare you take away my Jutsu!
 In places where the Leaf dances,a fire burns…
 The shadow of the firewill illuminate the Village…
 And once more the Leaf will sprout …
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 Lord Third Hokage…
 The ambition that you hadseems to have been passed on
 to the young Shinobiin the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 The flame in their hearts willburn large and strong in the future.
 And someday,they will illuminate this Village…
 just as you have done for us!

2,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Hey, you!
 Are you sure you wantto look like that?
 Yes, of course!C'mon! So hurry hurry!
 Don't regret it later.
 Say cheese!
 My Name Is Konohamaru!
 I couldn't decide on how to look.
 It took me 3 hours to decide.
 But as you can see,it's more like a work of art.
 Doesn't it look great?
 Take it over.
 What?!
 Take it over.
 Stop saying that!
 Transform!
 Oh please, Lord Hokage…
 The Sexy Jutsu…That's quite a devious technique.
 By the way Naruto,where's your headband?
 I won't wear it until the orientation.lt might get scratched
 Well, that's just fine.
 But the Ninja Registration Formis a very important document
 held in high regard by our village.
 Why do you want to look like this?
 Because!
 Anyway, how should I knowabout all that stuff?
 Old man!Get ready to fight!
 I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!
 Ouch!
 If it's not one thing, it's another….
 Drat! Is this a trap?
 Are you okay,Honorable Grandson?
 May I just inform you thatthere aren't any traps here…
 Huh? What's with this runt?
 What?!
 I know this kid…He's that Nine-Tailed boy!
 He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!
 You must have done this to me!
 You tripped all by yourself, stupid!
 Hey! Let go of him!
 He is the Honorable Grandsonof the Third Hokage!
 He stopped as soon ashe learned who I am….
 He's like my four-eyed teacher.
 He's just like everyone else!
 What's the matter?
 Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?
 Can't do it 'cuzI'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?
 As if I care! 					lmbecile!
 This guy…
 What?!
 Good grief…
 Listen to me.
 You are the Honorable Grandsonof the Third Hokage.
 Even though that scoundrel hit you,you must not associate with his kind.
 Nothing good will come ofyour tangling with him.
 This is your distinguishedteacher Ebisu,
 and I am never wrongabout these things!
 Don't you want to becomethe Fifth Hokage?
 Then allow meto teach you Ninjutsu,
 so that your dream willbecome a reality.
 That's right.
 Stick with me and you will gain a shortcuttowards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?
 He's gone!
 It seems he's gone after Naruto.
 Oh no!
 This is terrible!
 Honorable Grandson!
 How did he become like this?
 That was the 20th sneak attack today.
 And now he's in the company of Naruto.I'm a bit worried.
 I just hope he doesn't pick upmore foolishness.
 Huh?
 Stop following me!
 What is it now?!
 Your camouflage is pathetic.
 You've seen through my disguise...
 Your reputation is well-earned.
 I will allow you to make meyour apprentice.
 But you must first teach me that ""Sexy Jutsu""  technique
 you used to beat Grandpa Hokage.
 You gotta be kidding.
 I beg you to say yes, boss!
 Huh?
 Boss?
 Boss! Boss! Boss!
 I guess I have no choice.
 Listen.
 In order to become a skilled Ninja,
 you must first learn tocontrol your Chatora.
 Chatora?
 Yes, Chatora.
 Boss, I think you mean Chakra.
 Silence!
 That's what real Ninjas call it!
 Oh! I didn't know that!
 Whew… I'm glad he's a fool.
 Listen. Chakra essentially means…
 Basically, it is the energy neededin order to use Jutsu.
 Huh?
 In other words, fundamentally Ninja Artscombine the Chakra,
 the physical energy accumulatedfrom each cell in the body
 with spiritual energy intensifiedthrough training and experience.
 This combined energy is summonedwith certain hand signs.
 You made me thinkyou knew all that,
 when you were just readingfrom a scroll!
 Much has been said aboutperfecting the Ninja techniques,
 but it really boils downto just one thing.
 And what is that?
 Hard work and guts.
 Hard work and guts?
 That's right.
 So be ready for the challenging tasksI will give you.
 Yes, boss!
 Good. Let's start right now.Transform for me.
 Huh?
 Let me see firsthow much you already know.
 But what do I transform into?
 OK... First, transform into that lady.
 An easy task, boss.
 Transform!
 Well, do I look like her?
 Uhm… Well, the clothes do and…
 And what's so similarabout that?!
 Honorable Grandson.
 If you will transform into me,at least try to look a little cuter, OK?
 She's scary!
 Why am I the one who gets hit?
 OK!Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!
 Yes, boss!
 I told you I don't allowreading here, Naruto!
 This is the last test.Put all of your effort into it!
 Yes, boss!
 Transform!
 Naruto! It's you again!
 Why is it always me…?
 Sorry.
 Huh?
 It's becauseI'm the Hokage's grandson.
 Don't worry about it.
 Huh?
 You're now ready to performthe Sexy Jutsu!
 You just need more practice.
 Yes, boss!
 OK, keep in mind…the point is for ""boom boom boom""!
 Now do it!
 Yes, boss! 					Transform!
 What do you think?
 That won't do!
 More slender.
 Yes, boss!
 Is this okay?
 Not yet. 					More attractive.
 Yes, boss!
 How about now?
 That Naruto… What is he teachingthe Honorable Grandson…?
 Where the hell could they be…?
 I am a distinguished teachertraining potential Hokage.
 All those who interferewill be eliminated.
 You know I've been wondering…
 You seem obsessed with beatingyour Grandpa Hokage.
 My name is Konohamaru.
 It was Grandpa who gave methat name.
 He named me after our village.
 It should be easy for everyonehere to remember.
 But nobody ever calls meby that name.
 When they see me, all they seeis the grandson of Lord Hokage.
 No one sees me for who I really am.
 I can't stand it anymore.
 That's why…
 That's why I want the titleof Lord Hokage now.
 Idiot…Who do you thinkwill accept you, huh?
 Huh?
 You won't win the titlethat easily, you know.
 What?!
 It's not that simple.
 If you're really serious about gainingthe title of Lord Hokage…
 What?
 You'll have to beat me first!
 Lord Hokage!I've been looking for you.
 Iruka.
 Did Naruto re-submithis Ninja Registration Form?
 Yes.
 When I lectured to him the other nightat the ramen stand,
 he said he will make everyone accept himnow that he's a Ninja.
 He's been happy since then.
 It might not be easy for Narutoto realize that dream.
 Huh?
 As you well know,
 only the villagers who foughtthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago
 know that the monster is sealedinside Naruto.
 I ruled that no one shall speakabout that incident.
 I have severely punished thosewho have broken this rule.
 Now our children know nothing about it.
 That is the only positivedevelopment for Naruto.
 Before the Fourth Hokage trappedthe monster and died,
 his last wish was for the villagersto regard Naruto as a hero.
 A hero?
 The Fourth Hokage sealed the monsterinto the navel of a newborn baby
 whose umbilical cordhad just been cut.
 As the receptaclefor the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 Naruto saved the village.
 Unfortunately, the other villagersdon't see him like that.
 Some even say that Naruto isthe Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.
 Little by little, that attitude has beenpassed down to their own children.
 Iruka. 					Do you know?
 What, sir?
 When someone is hated and people refuseto accept his existence,
 he sees it in the eyesof the people around him.
 I have found you!
 Huh?
 That Demon Fox!!
 That cold look!lt's always like that!
 Honorable Grandson,we have to go now.
 No way!
 I want to beat Grandpa right nowso I can win the title of Lord Hokage!
 Don't get in my way!
 A Hokage must first know about virtue,honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,
 judgment, obedienceand all that.
 He must be skilled at more thanthousand techniques…
 And then...
 Transform!
 Take this! Sexy Jutsu!
 What? 					lt didn't work!
 What kind of adisgraceful spell is that?!
 I am a gentleman!
 Such vulgar attackswill never work on me!
 Honorable Grandson!That rascal will only make you an imbecile!
 Stick with me and...
 you will gain a shortcuttowards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 C'mon, let's go!
 No way!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu
 Wow! 					Fantastic!
 Ha! 					That's nothing.
 I am a distinguished teacher.
 I am not as weak as Mizuki.
 Boss…
 Transform!
 Transform!
 Oh, Master Ebisu…
 I call it ""the Harem Jutsu""!
 He combined the Multiple Clones withhis own Sexy Jutsu.
 That's another devious attack.
 I probably won't even survive that one.
 I can't even beat thatfour-eyed teacher of mine!
 I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly!I want to be recognized by everybody!
 But I keep failing.
 You think it's that easy?
 Huh?
 It's given only to the greatest Ninjain the village.
 Everybody must learn to believe in you.
 I've been through a lot already.
 It's been one struggle after another.
 But after all that,I found someone who accepts me.
 I had to go through a lot...Just for one person.
 You had better push yourself.
 For what?
 The path of getting the title,Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.
 There's no such thing as a shortcut.
 If you're really serious aboutattaining the title of Lord Hokage
 You'll have to beat me first.
 Who do you think you are,lecturing me like that?
 I won't be your apprentice anymore.
 From now on, you're my rival.
 Unfortunately for you,tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.
 Still, I'll consider you an equal somedaywhen we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.
 Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.
 You still have a long way to goto become a real Ninja.
 Aaah! Why do I have to be inthe same group with Sasuke?
 The guy I hate the most?
 Sakura keeps saying ""Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!""
 and doesn't evenpay attention to me!
 It makes me so mad!I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!
 I'm not gonna let him be so coolin front of Sakura!
 Next Episode: ""Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?""

40,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Curse Sealing!
 Out of character.
 It appears he’s quite tired…
 To think you’ve become able tohandle Sealing Jutsu…
 You’ve grown, eh, Kakashi…?
 You...
 Long time no see, Kakashi.
 Orochimaru…
 Kakashi vs. Orochimaru:Face to Face!
 Sorry, but…
 I have no business with you, Kakashi.
 But I do with the kid behind you.
 Why are you after Sasuke…?!
 It’s good for you.You already got it, right?
 You didn’t have it before, did you…?
 That.
 That...
 left eye Sharingan!
 I want it, too…
 The Uchiha power.
 Come on. Get up.
 W-What?!
 B-Bugs?
 They burst through the skin…from inside his body?!
 What a creepy guy!
 Heh! What kind of bluffare you trying to pull?
 These things are called Parasitic Insects.
 They attack their pray in groupsand eat Chakra…
 If attacking in this amount…
 you’re finished, no mistake.
 If you don’t like that, give up.
 That would be in your best interests.
 If you use your left armtechnique on me,
 I’ll simultaneously have the bugs exploitthe opening from behind.
 Conversely, if you useyour technique on the bugs,
 I’ll simultaneously exploit the opening…
 Either way, you won’t be ableto get through this.
 An ace in the hole is somethingyou set aside.
 Hey! Hold it!
 You little thief!
 Someone! Grab him!
 Uh-oh.
 Man, what a pigheaded kid.
 Making us go to trouble!
 You have potential, boy.
 I liked your eyes earlier…
 If you come with me,you can become strong.
 Follow me.
 If you come with me,you can become strong.
 You can become strong.
 Fight for me. If you do that…
 I’ll make you stronger.
 Now, please live up to my expectations…
 No longer...
 will I...
 It seems like you’re proudof your arms. You!
 S-Stop it!
 Stop!
 No longer...
 can I make thingsblow up in my face!
 Don’t... underestimate me!
 An ace in the hole is somethingyou set aside, right?!
 An ace in the hole is somethingyou set aside, right?
 What?! He could alreadyuse his right arm?!
 So the first half of the battle wasa strategic move
 to make us think he couldn’tuse his right arm.
 Not bad…Zaku.
 What’s your purpose?
 The recently built Sound Village.That’s my village, you see…
 You already understand, don’t you…?
 Humph! Ridiculous ambition.
 Oh, my… you said it.
 But, for that I need various pieceswho will obey my every whim.
 Take this!
 So Sasuke is one of those pieces?
 No. Sasuke is an exceptional piece.
 And the ones who are takingthe exams now…
 are mere throw-away pieces.
 My arms!
 What’s this?!
 Earlier when I recommendedthat you give up…
 as a precautionary measure,I gave a suggestion to the bugs…
 to block that troublesome wind holewith their bodies and remain still.
 This is what a real ace in the hole is.
 Punk!
 Don’t…come any closer... to Sasuke!
 Even if you’re one ofthe legendary three Ninja,
 at the least,I can kill you as you kill me!
 What’s funny?
 What you say and what you do,are all off.
 What?
 There’s no point at all inattempting such a seal.
 You understand, don’t you?
 The heart to seek outin pursuit of the goal,
 no matter what obstructive powerthere may be…
 He is the possessor of that quality.
 He’s an avenger…
 So you took advantage of that, eh?
 However, Sasuke is…
 At some point,he will definitely seek me out…
 in search of power.
 Oh, and, you’re going to kill me…?
 Why don’t you try?
 That is, if you can…
 Kill you as you kill me…?!
 Am I an idiot…?
 It seems…it’s over.
 The winner! Shino Aburame!
 W-What is he, Neji?!
 Byakugan!
 He’s something else…!
 I can understand him calling bugswith a Summoning Jutsu…
 but he harbors bugs all over his body.
 S-Say what?!
 He’s of the bug tamer race thatis passed down in the Leaf Village.
 Speaking of which,I’ve heard of it…
 The story of a race that asthey come into this world,
 possess the secret technique of loaningtheir bodies to bugs
 as a nest and fight using these bugs.
 They fully control the bugs andentrust most of the battle to the bugs…
 I hear that they contract to keepgiving the bugs their own Chakra
 as food for compensation.
 So he’s…the successor?
 That was unfortunate, Zaku.
 Why’d that happen to Zaku’s arms?
 Probably, that guy calledShino or whatever…
 exploited the opening andstuck those bugs
 into the exhaust opening in Zaku’s hands.
 If he were to fire the Slicing Sonic Wave in that condition,
 the energy with no way outwould expand in search of an exit…
 His arms that aregun barrels blow up…
 and become useless.
 Our relationship was only thatof having been given the same mission…
 but... I’ll even the score for you.
 Whew. He gives me a chill, indeed…
 What?! What?!
 So Shino, you were that strong,weren’t you?! Dang it!
 I thought he wasa creepy person from long before, but…
 Oh…
 S-Shino, good…work…
 Hey, you did it!
 Yes… I’m counting on you guys, too.
 He comes back like he’sthe team leader or something! Dang it!
 Umm, now then, I would like toget right to the next match.
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Yo!
 Not, “Yo!” Kakashi Sensei!
 What about Sasuke? Is he okay?
 Well, he’s fine.
 He’s sleeping soundly in the infirmary.
 However, with Anbu Opsstanding as guards…
 Oh.
 Tsurugi Misumi vs. Kankuro
 It’s finally my turn.
 Kankuro, he’s totally underestimating this…
 Humph. Idiot…
 It’s him…!
 Unlike Yoroi, I don’t getcareless with kids at all.
 I’ll say this first, once I do my technique…
 give up no matter what…
 I’ll bring it to an end swiftly.
 If so, I’ll also…
 bring it to an end swiftly!
 Now then, please begin…
 the third battle!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 I believed in your words the whole time.
 I wanted to be like you.
 I thought it would be niceif that happened.
 So Ino, I want to fight the full-tilt you.
 I’m no longer like I was before.
 There’s no point if I don’texceed the serious you.

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 I’ll give it to you straight…
 Your next mission was commissionedby a certain Feudal Lord’s daughter.
 You are to act as her double.
 I don’t know where she heard about you,
 but you apparently beara striking resemblance to the princess.
 Therefore she requestedthat you be the one who carries it out…
 A double…?
 Is someone targeting the princess?
 Well, if anything,she’s the one who’s doing the targeting…
 Huh?
 Not to worry.
 You’re already an admirableHidden Leaf Shinobi.
 Furthermore, I’ve arranged for youto have an assistant.
 Assistant?
 Grandma Tsunade!You have a mission for me?
 And one from a Feudal Lord to boot!
 Huh?! 					Lady Tsunade!
 Sorry, but all the other guysare too busy.
 Just me and this guy?
 Yup.Do your best to carry out the mission.
 The client isa Feudal Lord’s daughter, huh…
 Wow… I guess that means thatI’ve finally became good enough
 to handle amazing missionslike this, huh?!
 Hey, don’t get too excited.
 Terrible things happenwhen you're like that.
 I know…Just leave things in my capable hands!
 You’re really a piece of work…
 Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!
 Thank you for coming from afar.
 That’s the client?
 She and Ino really do look alike, but…
 I-It’s a bit of a stretch…
 It’s all right.I have an idea of what you wish to say.
 My physique doesn’t really resemblethat of the double there…
 That’s what you’re thinking, right?
 – Oh…not at all… Umm…– To be honest,
 – I don’t think you resemble her at all.– Hey!
 Well, I don’t blame you for thinking that.But here, have a look at this!
 T-That’s…lno!
 That’s what I looked likea short time ago…
 Truth be told, I only got like this
 after it was decided thatI was to have an arranged courtship.
 An arranged courtship?!
 The other party is Master Chikarafrom the neighboring Land of Udon.
 Ever since I saw his picture,
 my feelings for himhave deepened day by day.
 And as the dayof the arranged courtship grows closer,
 I have become increasingly nervous,my cheeks have been flushed,
 and my heart has been pounding.
 I can’t even sleep at night.
 And because of that stress,I’ve started overeating…
 It goes without saying thatyou’ll get fat if you pig out.
 Of course,I’ve taken appropriate countermeasures!
 I’ve been using something that cuts allthe fats and carbohydrates that I ingest…
 ""Easy-Peasy Slim Special”
 It didn’t work, did it?
 I placed too strong hopes in it…
 How can I possibly havean arranged courtship
 with the man I’m infatuated withwhen I look like this?
 So that’s my situation…Now, let’s get to the main issue.
 I want you to attendthe arranged courtship in my place
 and make it a success at any cost.
 Huh?! 					So this double thing
 is just to act on you behalfat some arranged courtship?!
 What do you mean by“some arranged courtship”?!
 I mean, when you talk about doubles,you thinks of situations
 where someone’s life is in dangerand that sort of thing.
 What are you talking about?!
 The princess’s entire life is at stake!This is major!
 Oh! So you understand a heart in love…
 I sure do…A girl always wants to look cute
 for the guy she loves.
 Even if she’s a fake…?
 It can’t be helped.I mean, guys prefer slender girls.
 That’s exactly right!
 I’m counting on you.
 Sure thing! Leave it to me!
 But even ifthe arranged courtship goes well…
 The gap is just too big.
 I’ll just have to lose weightby the day of the wedding.
 I already have a plan in place for that.
 This supplemental type diet food,“Supplement Slender”!
 If I supplement all three meals with this…
 Why don’t you draw on the lessonsyou’re supposed to have learned…?
 In any case, I’ll use my charms to makethis arranged courtship a success!
 This annex is whereI often played in my childhood.
 I plan to use this to listen in onthe arranged courtship from here.
 Huh… That’s pretty convenient.
 I would love to meet him in personif I could, but…
 Hey, is he that cool looking?
 Of course he is!
 He’s someone withsomething really special about him!
 Well then,just make sure he falls for you.
 Leave it to me!
 I thought you weren’t motivated…
 Well, this is a mission after all.
 So I think I’ll pull myself togetherand hustle!
 Don’t do anything unnecessary, okay!
 W-What’s up?
 The sound is getting closer!
 – What? 					– It’s so bright!
 There are many a handsome manin this world,
 but this man isrenowned even among them!
 This man makesLand of Udon what it is…
 that sexy manwith glistening sidelong glances!
 The oh-so-great young prince Chikara…
 Kneel down and bow before him!
 Sorry.
 It appears thatI have kept you waiting, princess
 You're…Master Chikara?
 He’s even more intense thanlntense-Brow Sensei.
 I’m sorry, pretty girl.
 I have constitutional low blood pressure.
 Dunno. He looks more likehe has high blood pressure to me…
 What?
 D-Do you always scatterflower petals?
 Flowers are wonderful.
 They truly allay the fatigueof your mind and your body.
 Don’t you find them relaxing?
 I-I guess…
 Okay then, next…
 Hey, don’t you thinkhe’s different from her description…?
 I mean, he’s fa…
 Fa…?!
 Stop!
 These sweets are really fabulous,aren't they?
 Do excuse us a little.
 What the heck are you doing,out of the blue like that?!
 It’s women’s intuition.
 I got the same vibe from him as Choji.
 That word is probably taboo.
 Oh, I see!
 Gimme a break!
 What’s up with that uselesslyintense chubby guy showing up
 when she told ushe’d be a handsome prince?!
 But wouldn’t his physiquebe a perfect match for her?
 I’m sure there must be some mistake.
 There’s no way a girlwould fall in love with a guy like that.
 But maybe that’sthe princess’ taste in men…
 That’s impossible. I mean…
 He’s flashy…!
 Intense…!
 And a fatso!
 He’s a freak! A freak!
 There’s gotta be a mistake!I’m sure of it!
 Y-You think so?
 What are you saying?
 There’s no mistake that that’sMaster Chikara, the man of my heart.
 I thought so…
 What an elegant man…
 I deeply regret that I cannot see himup close with my very own eyes.
 I guess one could say that everybodyhas their own set of woes.
 Listen, make sure thathe takes a liking to me no matter what!
 Stop complaining and get the ball rollingwith dogged persistence!
 I will convey that to her.
 Has you tension not eased?Music is good for relaxation.
 Please, you need not go to the trouble…
 – What did she say?– She said there’s no mistake.
 She wants you to bulldoze on ahead!
 I can’t believe it!
 It’s our mission, you know!
 I know that…
 Princess Fuku…do you like roses?
 Yes…very much so…
 Great! 					I love roses too!
 In the language of flowers,they signify love!
 But don't their meaningsdiffer depending on their color?
 For example, yellow roses aresupposed to mean “Let’s break up”…
 It’s nonsense to discriminatebecause of color…
 I mean the flowersare not at fault, after all.
 For you.
 Hey…wait!
 Huh?
 I can’t do it! I can’t do it!
 There’s no way!He’s too intense.
 There’s no way I can act asa substitute for the princess!
 Calm down.Stop saying that and do your best.
 Nope.I just can’t stand him physically.
 Oh, I got it.
 If you just think of him
 – as a somewhat intense Choji…– Choji has fat on him
 for the sake of his Ninjutsu…
 I don’t have the slightest ideawhat purpose that prince’s fat serves.
 That’s a pretty severe opinion,you know…
 I’m going off somewhere for a moment.
 Huh? Hey, where are you going?!
 Gimme a break, that girl’s a handful…
 Well, this is for the sake ofa mission after all.
 I guess it’s about time for Narutoto lend a helping hand!
 What is it?!
 I’m not judging you, but I think youshould pass on that young prince.
 There’s something wrong with his head.I’m positive!
 What are you saying?He’s a passionate and wonderful man!
 But…
 I hired the Leaf toprovide me with substitute for
 the arranged courtshipand bring it to success.
 You’re a professional Shinobi, right?
 So I suggest you get on itand get the job done!
 The atmosphere in therehasn’t been very congenial at all!
 You need to be aggressivein making yourself appealing to him!
 I’m sorry to havekept you waiting, Chikara!
 That’s right!Just like that…huh?
 That jerk…!
 H-Hey!
 P-P-Princess?
 Master Chikara… Could you loosenmy sash for me, please?
 But…but…
 Please.
 Oh my gosh!
 There’s a creepy-crawler up hereunder the roof that looks like a sow bug!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu!
 A creepy-crawlerthat looks like a sow bug?
 An insect?
 Oh…she vanished…
 What the heck are you thinking?!
 Where is the princess?
 I don’t know.
 She vanished…
 What is going on anyway?
 This is starting to irritate me…I can’t get what’s happening from here.
 Why are you meddling!I was just one step away!
 What do you think you’re doing,dressed up like Princess Fuku?!
 I’m telling you!
 In one of Pervy Sage’s bookshappened to glance at,
 this is the kind of thing that worked.
 I don’t believe that anyone woulduse such a garish advance!
 That’s dirty!
 There’s absolutely no waya type of guy like you
 would ever be mistaken forthe protagonist of a boy’s comic!
 Huh! I was doing a way better jobthan you were!
 Gimme a break…
 Now that things have come to this,
 I need to take care of businessbefore another meddler gets in the way!
 Huh… You gotta be kidding…
 It looks like my help is neededif this mission is going to be a success.
 Princess…where in the world have you been?
 Please forgive me. I was so nervousI just flew into a panic earlier on…
 You really seemed likea totally different person.
 I’m so sorry.
 You were such a wonderful person,that it became almost unbearable…
 Non. That is bad.
 We must changethe air in here then.
 Oh, in that case, I will…
 Hi… Chikara!
 Huh?
 That just now,outside the sliding paper door…
 What’s the matter?
 There was one more…princess!
 That can’t be… Impossible.
 INNER INO 							Naruto…!
 But I’m very moved thatyou have such deep feelings for me
 that you actually saw a vision…
 Vision? No, I definitely saw…
 You mustn’t look!
 P-Princess?
 Damn…I did that without thinking…
 Oh goodness me…
 In my ardent desire foryou to look just at me, I…
 What intense passion…
 All right…As you wish, princess.
 – Huh? 					– Allow me to catch
 those hot feelings in fine style!
 Could this be…?
 Come, don’t hold back.
 Huh?!
 You may not kiss him!No kisses!
 Oh!
 Goodness, you cannotbe too careful these days!
 Who told you that you couldgo as far as kissing him?!
 Oh, it’s not that I wanted to…
 I’d have to say thatyou actually came to my rescue.
 Don’t bandy words with me!
 Listen carefully, holding hands isas much as I can concede to you…!
 You’re too loud!
 The princess vanished again.
 – Princess! 					– Princess!
 This isn’t good!I better hurry back.
 Don’t try anything funny in there!
 I know that! In any case, we can’t let himsee the two of us together!
 Hurry back to your room, Princess!
 All right.
 Gimme a break that Ino…
 Dumping me in the lake like that.Thanks to her I’m freezing!
 This is bad! I gotta pee…Gotta go!
 I don’t know wherethe toilet is around here.
 There’s nobody around…Well, it is an emergency situation after all.
 Huh?!
 W-W-What the heck do you thinkyou’re doing over there looking like me?!
 No…this is…um…
 How shameless!Stop that immediately!
 I can’t stop it…
 Do you not understand thatI’m telling you to stop!
 It’s impossible to stop so sudden!
 Hey!
 Wait up!
 I wasn’t quiteemotionally prepared earlier on…
 However, the feelings I havefor you in my heart are true.
 Princess…
 Master Chikara…
 I have harbored a secret love for youfor a long time.
 Please, take me…
 Huh?
 – I wonder what that sound is?– I have no idea…
 Rain?
 What a beautiful rainbow…
 Stop, I say!
 I told you, it’s impossible!
 Ouch!
 Princess?!
 Naruto!
 You idiot!
 Forgive me for this one, please!
 I won’t forgive you!
 Look what you’ve done!
 Ouch… Stop!
 What in the world is going on?!
 Oh no!… 					Umm…this is, well…
 All right, that’s enough…We can't fake it any longer.
 I apologize for having hoodwinked you.I am…the bona fide Fuku.
 You mean to say thatthe princess up to now was an imposter?
 That is correct.
 What is the meaning of all this?
 I wouldn’t have imagined thatthings would come to such a finale!
 No, that’s not correct, Master Chikara!
 Out of my way!
 The super body I fantasized aboutin my dreams! My ideal personified!
 Bravo!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 My cute princess. Please marry me!
 I’m delighted, Master Chikara!
 Hail the future wife!
 What is this anyway…?
 Somehow it seems like our missionturned out to be success in the end…
 I think?
 Could it be? I put all my effortsin making advances on a guy
 who’s not my type in the leastand got rejected.
 Moreover,it was a totally wasted effort…
 Is that what happened?
 But, everything turned out well.So isn’t it okay?
 And both of them look so happy together…
 That’s not the problem!A damsel’s heart has been wounded…
 I can’t believe that, of all things,I was brushed off by a guy like that…
 He didn’t even glance in your directionat the end there.
 Stop it! Don’t remind me.
 You can never knowswhat a person likes, can you?
 Nope…there’s no way I’ll acknowledge that!
 A man’s got to like a slender girl better!
 In order to becomeeven more of a woman,
 I’m going on a diet! On a diet!
 Wait…wait up!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say,“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”

 Spat at that beloved face!!Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stagedoes bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feelin my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s fromthat coke I just drank?
 Naruto, let’s make somebittersweet memories of youth together!
 – Huh? 					– No need to be shy.
 I am ready both in mind and body!
 What are you blabbing aboutall of a sudden?!
 It was long…
 To think how muchI’ve waited for this moment!
 I have no idea what you’re talking about!
 Here I come Naruto!Please become my first.
 Just a minute.

 Naruto!
 There was an emergency transmissionfrom the training room!
 What in the world happened?!
 Actually, the star was stolen.
 The enemy is a Ninjawho flies using Chakra!
 No way…!
 I’ve never heard ofa flying Shinobi.
 Byakugan!
 I lost him…
 But what Naruto said is true.
 To think he can flyusing Chakra…
 That’s an incredible Shinobi.
 So it was true.
 What?! You didn’t believewhat I said?!
 You could say that.
 Wh-What’s up with that?
 Do I have that little credibility?!
 The Remembered Lullaby
 So the star ofthe Village Hidden in Stars
 is a meteorite, huh?
 Yes…
 The First Hoshikage…
 That’s what they callthe village leader.
 He discovered that ifyou train by the “star…”
 Chakra is strengthened.
 Ever since then…
 the Hidden Star has beenin a unique position
 even among the Ninja hidden villages.
 But it says in these documents
 that the training hasn't been conductedthese past ten years…
 The leader who called himselfthe Third Hoshikage
 prohibited the training…
 But about a year ago…
 It seems they started againafter that Hoshikage died…
 But why? Why do somethinglike prohibit training…?
 Who knows…?
 It’s a classified matter ofthe Village Hidden in the Stars, so…
 But there were various rumorscirculating around about it…
 Rumors?
 Yeah… Rumors about mostof the Ninjas who trained dying…
 Chakra is forcibly strengthenedby the power of the unknown star.
 There may have beenadverse effects on the body.
 What…?
 The star was stolen?!
 Yes! The people who weretraining were at the scene,
 but they were all knocked outby an enemy Jutsu…
 Pathetic!
 You say that,but that Ninja had incredible Chakra!
 Naruto, is it that incredible?
 Yeah! Turning Chakrainto monsters or wings.
 It’s the first time I ever saw that!
 Is that true…Sumaru?
 Yes!
 It’s the Ninja Art: Kujaku,no mistake!
 That’s the Jutsu passed onin the Village Hidden in the Stars, huh?
 Yeah… As for that Jutsu, only thosewho have mastered the star training can…
 Sumaru!
 Tenten…
 The secrets of a Jutsu are not tobe spoken of or asked about lightly.
 Especially with a Jutsu that can onlybe passed on to those of that village…
 I’m sorry…
 Lord Akahoshi,please give me an order!
 The star being stolenis my responsibility.
 No…
 The star was stolen
 even though we were commissioneda mission to protect it.
 It’s also our responsibility.
 We will get the star back byour own hands, no matter what!
 Yes… I will leave the search forthe star to the Leaf Shinobi…
 Sumaru, you keep an eyeon your injured comrades.
 But only those in the villageknow village matters…!
 It’s an order!
 Hey! Are your friends who got beaten upby the enemy Ninja okay?
 That’s none of your business!
 What…?!
 At the end of the day,you’re still Ninja from some other village!
 You’re not my friends or anything!
 What’s with him?!
 Neji, you’re talking abouttaking responsibility,
 but we haven’t even seenthe scene of the theft.
 That’s right…And we don’t have any leads.
 No, we do.
 You didn’t pick up on it?
 Akahoshi the village leaderknows something!
 What do you mean byknowing something?
 Come to think of it,
 when Sumaru was talking aboutthe Kujaku something or other,
 his expression changed.
 Then that means the culprit issomeone associated with this village?
 So, like I said, what does this mean?!
 I’ll make a go around the village
 and look for something thatcould make for a lead.
 Lee and Tenten, you keep watch overthat village leader called Akahoshi.
 I understand!
 Leave it to us!
 I don’t get it!What the heck should I do?!
 Let me see…You investigate from Sumaru’s angle.
 All right! Leave Sumaru to me.
 Then, I’m off for a run!
 Same as always…
 Naruto sure isan impetuous person, isn’t he?
 ♪ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?
 Because I had a sad dream last night.
 My eyes are red, from the tears I shed
 Swollen as I cried…
 Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?
 I'm searching for a childwho has gone afar
 My sad dreams come once more. ♪
 Hey Sumaru!
 What’re you doing?!
 Nothing! I was just lookingat the stars!
 Stars?
 Come to think of it,you can see the stars well in this village.
 That red star’s sure pretty…
 Natsuhiboshi…
 It watches over me all the time…
 Huh?
 H-Hey… Hold it. I want to govisit your friends.
 Look, here…
 I’ve brought the Hidden Leaf specialtyRoasted Chestnut Bean Jelly!
 Go if you like!lt’s right near the training room!
 Huh?
 A cold-hearted guy as usual…
 What? Is nobody here?
 Sorry to bother you.
 Where is everyone?
 Oh, is somebody sleeping?
 Stop it… Hokuto.
 I can tell… He’s not an enemy.
 Mizura…!
 You little!145.01	01:35:28:21	01:35:32:04	Oh, ouch…
 A girl…?
 Who are you?
 I’m a Ninja from the Village Hiddenin the Leaves, Naruto Uzumaki!
 I came to this villageto protect the star !
 Y-You are…?
 I’m sorry for my rough behavior!
 It’s cool. I just came to visit…
 Where’s the RoastedChestnut Bean Jelly…?
 Oh! That’s it!
 Oh, no!
 There’s no mistake…
 Then it was that person whomade off with the star, after all…
 So you’re saying that one’s still alive…?
 Then this will be difficult.
 That one being the final Ninjacompletely trained
 in the power of the star means…
 Not an opponent we can handlewith the likes of our Jutsu!
 Don’t get flustered…
 If the culprit is who we think it is,
 we already hold that one’s weaknessin our hands.
 I get it…
 Then let’s grab that person up.
 Wait…
 First we must avert the eyesof the annoying flies!
 I’m sorry…My name is Hokuto…
 I felt Chakra from someone notof this village…
 I carelessly…
 Well, the flavor won’t change, so eat up.
 Okay…
 Oh my… It really is good!
 Right? Right?
 Say… What happened to the others?
 The thief just put us to sleep…
 There wasn’t such a great dealof damage.
 I see.
 You okay?
 Thanks for saving my butt back there!
 Is there something wrong with you?
 No…nothing at all…
 After Mizura began the star training,he started to feel poorly…
 Hokuto! Don’t be talking about the star
 to someone from another village!
 Are you okay, Mizura…?!
 I’m sorry. I got carried away…
 Other village…You guys are kind of cold-hearted.
 Especially that Sumaru guy…
 I’m sorry…
 But there’s a reasonwhy Sumaru became like that.
 What?
 It happened ten years ago…
 Sumaru’s parents whowere protecting the star
 were killed by Ninja fromsome other village…
 who came to steal the star.
 So probably, he’s…
 So that’s what it was about…That’s why he got like that.
 So where is Sumaru…?And where the other guys?
 It seems everyone wentto take back the star.
 Huh?!
 Oh!
 Naru…to?
 They’ve come out.
 Right…
 We should take them onfair and square here…
 Idiot! There’d be no pointto surveillance!
 I’m not much one forsniffing around secretly.
 Be quiet. They’ll notice us!
 Leave the trailing Ninjutsu to me…Follow me quietly!
 But…
 It’s a mission!
 I understand…
 Let’s go…!
 Secretly, secretly…
 It’s okay… They haven’t noticed.
 But I get the feeling this kind of thinggoes against my Way of Ninja…
 Don’t complain!
 Secretly, secretly…
 You don’t need to say secretly, secretly!
 But is this really a trailing Ninjutsu?
 Uh-oh…
 Have we been noticed?
 Wait…
 It appears we weren’t noticed…
 Let’s continue trailing them!
 Right! They turned right!
 R-Roger!
 They vanished…
 Did they give us the slip?
 Could it be, they noticed us?
 Wait…! We’re not enemies!
 That’s right!
 We came here on a mission fromthe Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 Oh-ho, Leaf Shinobi, you say?
 Then aren’t you guys trailingthe wrong people?
 That might be so.
 But there’s the possibility thatyou guys have transformed
 into people from this village, so…
 Brave words.
 I apologize for the rudeness…
 But now the star has been stolen.
 And we don’t have any leads…
 So that’s whyyou were investigating us, huh…?
 That was unnecessary…
 Oh well… We will take backthe star with our own hands.
 You guys just make sureyou don’t get in our way!
 They kind of tick me off…
 But it’s as Neji said…
 It seems there’s some kindof secret in this village, eh?
 Seems so…
 Everyone…join hands!
 Listen up! Pick up the samestar Chakra as us!
 There he is!
 You can’t cut a rope wovenwith Chakra!
 Give back the star!That’s our life!
 Neji, have you seen Sumaruand the others?
 You weren’t keeping watch of him?
 Actually, it seems most of the guyswent out to look for the star.
 I see…
 Hey… is it okay to be all relaxed?
 Hey, is something wrong?
 There’s massive Chakraat the Valley of Death.
 Did he appear again?!
 Let’s go!
 All right!
 G-Give back our…star…
 Give it back…
 Hold it!
 Eat this!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku!
 I won’t let you get away!
 Hold it!
 Farewell!
 Wh-What?!
 Damn you!
 Wait!
 Let me go! Let me go, I say!
 Calm down!
 Up ahead is the valley filledwith poison gas…
 O-Okay…
 You would’ve been dead meat ina few seconds without that mask on…
 Damn it. We almost had him.
 So that was the Shinobiwho stole the star?
 Yeah! Absolutely no doubt about it!
 Why? Why is it necessaryto go out of his way
 to take Sumaru away althoughhe carried out his goal already?
 Does that have something to do
 with the star being targetedten years ago?
 At that time, it seems Sumaru’s parentsgot killed protecting the star.
 What?!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 We need to reinvestigatethe village leader and his relations.
 Please leave it to me!I’ve got an ace strategy.
 A strategy?
 I can’t count on Tenten’strailing Ninjutsu, can I?
 What did you say?!
 Do whatever you want.Just follow through with it.
 All right! Here I go!
 We’ll see how good you are.
 Then, me, too…
 Hold it, Naruto.

 Shizune!
 Is anything wrong?!
 What is it…?
 It’s a protection commissionfrom the Village Hidden in the Stars.
 Is there some kindof problem with that?
 You’ve never heard about it, Shizune?
 The Village Hidden in the Starsis small in terms of scale,
 but they are very proud andhave often caused trouble…
 So, will you accept?
 I can’t simply disregard it.
 What…?
 Since you-know-whatis in that village.
 And it seems they’ll forma three-man team
 with Neji as the squad leader.
 But the Village Hidden in the Starsis a Shinobi village, isn’t it?
 Then they should dotheir own protecting
 without asking others.
 There are often instancesof a small village
 with friendly relationsseeking cooperation.
 In particular, that village is small
 and it seems there aren’tthat many Shinobi.
 No kidding. But why’s a placelike that being targeted?
 Actually…!
 It all happened 200 years ago.
 A star fell in the village!
 Those stars like in the sky,not ninja stars or something?!
 Right! It seemsthere’s a mysterious power in the star
 that has an effect on Chakra!
 That’s a superstition!
 In the first place, no way hasa star ever come falling down!
 It’s true!
 It’s actually been targetedseveral times until now
 by Shinobi of other lands.
 By Shinobi of other lands?
 Mysterious power, huh?
 Indeed, it does seem that someonelike Orochimaru would target it…
 All right, I guess I’ll be participatingin this one too!
 What?! But the three-man team’salready been determined.
 I’ve got an ace up my sleeve…
 Amaguriama Sweet Shop
 Listen up. I’ll take the lead from here.
 There’s danger beforeentering the village.
 Okay, got it!
 Hi, guys!
 I’ll go on ahead and be waiting!
 Naruto! Hold it!
 That idiot!
 Umm, what’s Naruto doingin a place like this?
 Like I know.
 Lady Tsunade, there was a report
 that Naruto has joined upwith Neji’s squad.
 Yes. I added him tothe Village Hidden in the Stars mission.
 Why…?!
 Those four proved themselvesin the Katabami Gold Mine…
 and things will quiet downin the village here, too.
 You’d change an already determinedthree-man squad just for that reason?!
 Lady Tsunade?!
 Rare Roasted Chestnut Bean Jellywith gold leaf candy from Amaguriama?

 I’m fine…
 I told you not to push yourself!

 What’re you doingduring your training?!
 Mizura suddenly keeledover in pain…
 Take him to the medical treatment room.
 Yes sir.
 I’ll go, too.
 Hokuto by herself isenough for an escort.
 Sumaru, you have a mission.
 All right! I’m here first!
 Once I cross this valley,I’ll be in the Land of Bears.
 The Village Hidden in the Starsis close.
 Wha--?!
 You little…!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku…
 Protection!
 This guy blocked Kunai kniveswith Chakra!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Cut!
 Damn it!
 Incredible Chakra!
 Wait!
 This guy’s an enemy…He suddenly attacked!
 You’re Leaf Shinobi, right?
 Are you fromthe Village Hidden in the Stars?
 I’m Sumaru.I came to pick you guys up.
 Then why did you do such a thing…?
 Look at that.
 Huh?
 The border of the Land of Bearsis constantly filled with poison gas.
 It’s also serves asa natural fortress
 against invasion from other lands.
 So this is the dangeryou were talking about, huh?
 Isn’t that great, Naruto?You owe Sumaru your life!
 It’s the beginning ofa beautiful friendship
 between the Leafand the Hidden Star Village.
 Give me a break.
 Was it none of my concern?
 I could have just watchedand not done anything…
 I am Akahoshi
 and I serve as the deputy Hoshikageof the Village Hidden in the Stars.
 Deputy…Hoshikage?
 Due to the sudden passingof the Third Hoshikage one year ago,
 presently there isno Hoshikage in this village…
 But, I heard the only ones who canrefer to themselves as a Kage
 are the leaders ofthe Five Great Hidden Villages…
 That doesn’t make any difference!
 We are not inferior to you guys!
 Even if we’re small now,this village will someday rival
 the Hidden Villages ofthe Five Great Nations!
 At that time,I’ll become the true Hoshikage!
 Silence!
 Go back to the training ground.
 H-Hey, wait up!
 Oh! Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Now of all times!
 Don’t worry about him.Please continue your story.
 Forgive me.
 As  you say, the Shinobi in our villageare not qualified
 to refer to themselves as a Kage.
 However, in this village,there is the star
 that all the Kage in the FiveGreat Hidden Villages also envy.
 We will use the powerof the star and someday,
 this can become a village which canclaim the Sixth Kage title.
 So that star is being targeted, right?
 Yes. Our search teamobtained some information.
 Where’d that guy go?
 Hey!
 I finally caught up.Was your name Omaru?
 Not Omaru, Sumaru.
 Oh, sorry, sorry.
 But Sumaru’s surean interesting name.
 It’s another name forthe star cluster Pleiades or Spring Star.
 Everyone in this village hasa name associated with stars.
 After all, this is a villagewhere a star fell.
 I see…
 What’re you trying to elicit from me?
 What? Nothing in particular.
 I hadn’t thanked you for earlier, so.
 I can tell even if you give methe runaround…
 The people from other landsare all after the star.
 If you have that power,
 you can stand above allof the Hidden Villages, so…
 Is your awesome Chakraalso the power of the star?
 If they had that star,
 would everyone havethe same Chakra as you?
 No! The more tremendous the power,
 the more hard work is requiredto control it!
 I’ll work hard, work hard, work hard!
 I’ll become the Hoshikage!
 Yeah! I look forward to workingwith you at that time!
 Huh…?
 I’m also going to becomethe Hokage someday, believe it!
 You’re a strange guy.
 Really?
 Intruder!
 Protect the star!
 But they really are collapsed entirelyfrom the center towards the outside.
 When a star explodes in mid-air,it seems they collapse like this.
 That’s the training areawhere the star is enshrined.
 Hurry up and show me the star.
 No. People from other landsaren't allowed beyond this spot.
 But the star is over there, right?
 I can’t protect itif I can’t get close to it!
 It’s not like we trust you guys.
 Geez, you’re such a suspicious guy!
 Why can’t you trust uswho came here on a mission?!
 This is my personality, you see.
 It can’t be?! No way.
 I’ll chase him down!
 You go to your friendsin the training area.
 Hurry!
 Right. Okay.
 Hokuto!
 Sumaru… I’m sorry.
 We couldn’t protect the star…
 You little!
 It’s ridiculous to do somethinglike steal in someone else’s village
 in broad daylight, you little thief!
 Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Now, I won’t let you getaway!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku…
 This Chakra?!
 Beast!
 Uh, oh! Move away!
 Fire the Everywhere Shuriken Jutsutowards that monster!
 It’s futile!
 This is my real target!
 I found your weak point.
 The main body doesn’t movewhile controlling the Chakra!
 Let’s go! Clone Body Slam!
 There are more ways touse my Chakra!
 That one hit hard.
 Synthesis!
 Damn…
 Naruto!
 Wings!
 You can fly?!
 You let him get away.
 I’m sorry. But…
 It was my mistake forleaving it to you.
 But as for him,he used the same Ninja Art as you.
 What’s the meaning of this?!
 Only those who performthe star training
 can use that Ninja Art…
 Then you’re sayinghe’s someone from this village?
 I don’t know…
 I’m the one who let him get away.
 I’ll get the star back, no matter what!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 I’m kind of bothered bythe village leader’s attitude.
 That the opponent usedthe Ninja Art: Kujaku means…
 Yeah, the attacker is definitelya Shinobi from this village.
 But, that old man didn’t say anything.
 It looks like there’s some kindof secret.
 We need to investigate him.Let’s all split up.
 Roger!

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,

 The Powerful Helper
 Old Man Genno…
 Yes! This is quite good!
 Isn't it?!
 Why’d he do something like this?
 Now this detonator won’t activate.
 Excellent, Tenten.
 Now we can sigh with relief.
 No, it’s still too soon to be relieved.
 Right… When Genno realizes that
 the detonator here has been removed…
 he might activatethe Paper Bombs with
 some other method and blow up the Leaf.
 Oh, right.
 You jerk. Don’t scare me like that, Choji!
 Sorry.
 At the moment,it seems there’s no one here
 who’s picked up on our movements.
 All right, then put things backthe way they were.
 Got it.
 Now then…
 You guys do the Kunai Knife practicelike before.
 Don’t hit the center.
 We know.
 But we were sure lucky…Nobody hit the center.
 But I hit it right in the center yesterday.
 I bet you were off by a little.
 What? I don’t know about that..
 It hit, I tell you.
 To think there’d be this many.
 Lady Tsunade, let’s evacuatethe villagers as quickly as possible.
 Hey, you’re joking, right?
 What do you mean?
 If you do that, Genno might…
 blow up the remaining Paper Bombs
 right under the coverof the evacuation confusion.
 I see.
 Naruto and the others are removingthe Paper Bombs now.
 Could you wait for their report?
 Akamaru?
 Did you find one?
 There it is!
 All right!
 Attaboy, Akamaru.
 How’s it coming?
 Just a little more.
 Yes!
 I leave the rest to you.
 Leave it to me.
 Did you get it yet, Naruto?
 Just a little more.
 Just a little more, I tell you.
 H-Hang in there, Naruto.
 Damn it, you little…
 Hey, what’re you guys doing?
 Oh, umm…
 Some money got into the opening.
 Oh, I’ll get it out for you later.
 No, no. That’d be dangerous…
 I mean, there’s no time to waste witheating ramen.
 Th-That’s right.
 Ichiraku is sure tasty, isn’t it?Well, hang in there.
 Yeah, thank you.
 Thanks.
 Phew, we got through it well.
 Excellent, Naruto.
 We’d like more manpower.
 It takes too long just with us.
 But there aren’t any other Shinobileft in the village.
 Well, there are some here, though.
 People of leisure who do nothingbut tell about old stories and
 complain aboutwhat the young people do.
 Huh?
 Could they be…?
 Did you get that foul mouth fromthe Third Hokage?
 It’s the job of us advisors togive advice to the youngsters.
 What’s wrong with complaining?
 It seems you have a good nose forvillage crises due to your longevity.
 You’re plenty older thanyou look yourself.
 Wh-What did you say? You old bag!
 Watch what you say, eh, Fifth Hokage.
 We’ve grasped most of the situation.Where should we head to?
 Then there’s a placeI’ve been saving for you.
 Oh ho. I can’t wait.
 To think the Fifth Hokage would be beaten.
 That’s a powerful supporter.
 Wow.
 But scary.
 Hurry! Youth, full power!
 The enemy’s in the Leaf!
 I appreciate it,but I can’t stand those two.
 But the removal operationwill proceed swiftly
 once Guy Senpai and the others whoheaded for the Hidden Waterfall get back.
 It’ll be nice if things were togo conveniently like that, but…
 Shikamaru, have you got something?
 I mean, it’s not ordinary stuff.
 When and how the helldid he set them?
 There are too many Paper Bombs.An abnormal amount of it.
 No doubt about it.
 Uh-huh.
 And there’s one more thingbugging me.
 We’re overlooking something huge…I really get that feeling.
 Almost.
 What’re you doing?You’re not supposed to hit the center.
 That’s right.
 I’m next. I’ll miss.
 In your case,you’ll probably miss even if you aim.
 How’s it going, Neji?
 The Paper Bomb removal operationis going smoothly.
 I don’t see anyoneresembling Genno either.
 I wonder where the enemy is.
 Making us walk all the way tothe outskirts of town.
 She must’ve gotten this slave drivertendency from the Third Hokage.
 A place that wouldn’t be unusualfor old people to tell old stories.
 I’ll rake her over the coalswhen we get back.
 But what is that Genno fellow thinking?
 There’s no point to settingPaper Bombs in a place like this.
 Is that what you really think?
 What?
 There was a plan to build
 a shopping districtaround here before, right?
 That talk was over thirty years ago.
 Hmm?!
 What’s this?
 H-Hey, isn’t that…?
 Yes.
 Look at this.
 What is it?
 The Jutsu form written here is different.
 You’re right.
 Now that you mention it, there’s no doubt.
 It looks the same to me, though.
 Where are your eyes pointing?
 It’s the first time I’ve seen this.
 It’s nothing new to us.
 Speaking of Paper Bombs,that’s what they were in the old days.
 Then this is an old version?
 It seems most of the Paper Bombs
 that have been set inthe village are of that type.
 Everyone, please look closely once more
 at the locations wherethe Paper Bombs were set.
 Although this isa residential area here,
 there are hardly any Paper Bombs set.
 On the other hand,a large number of Paper Bombs
 have been set in placeswhere hardly anyone lives.
 What does that mean?
 In the old plans,
 that was supposed to becomea bustling shopping district.
 What? Could that be…?
 If you think about it putting togethervarious factors
 such as the antique Paper Bombs,
 the places where they were setand such…
 This is a trap that wasset thirty years ago.
 Thirty years ago…
 It’s just ridiculous.Not one person noticed in thirty years.
 It’s a blind spot.
 Nobody would ever think
 that this many Paper Bombs wouldbe set here in this village.
 Once buried in a wall,
 it couldn’t be found unless Byakuganor something was used.
 Then you meanthe Genno guy tried to use
 the Paper Bombs someoneset thirty years ago?
 But how did he find them?
 Thirty years ago?Could it be…?!
 Shikamaru, where are you going?
 Hey! Wait up.
 We’re finished here, too
 Let’s go to the next spot, Hinata.
 Right.
 Hinata!
 What’s the matter?
 I was using the Byakugan the whole time,
 so I’m just a little tired…I’m fine.
 Are you sure?
 Let me see.
 Oh.
 You’re kind of feverish.Your face is red, too.
 No, it’s not like that.
 I’ll be okay if I just rest a little…
 Really? Then I’ll deliverthe Paper Bombs
 we’ve gathered thus farto Grandma Tsunade,
 so you wait here.
 Okay.
 I’ll be right back!
 Ichiraku Ramen
 The old man was standing herethe first time I met him.
 I thought he was justa ramen-loving old man, but…
 Hm?
 Could it be that whathe was looking at then was…?
 Why in a place like this?
 Well well…
 So you found it, huh?
 Old man?
 I guess I cannot let yougo back now, can I?
 Thirty years ago, huh?
 That’s around the time whenmy dad was still the master carpenter.
 It was probably a time
 when many outsiders were hiredjust like now.
 But I wonder if there are recordsfrom back then.
 Anything would be fine.A blueprint or a ledger.
 Hey, Shikamaru.What’re you talking about? Explain.
 Why did the referral vanish?
 Referral? You mean the real referral
 that became the catalyst forGenno being suspected?
 It was bugging me the whole time.
 Perhaps the disappearance ofthe referral was Genno’s doing.
 But why was it necessaryto get rid of it?
 It all makes senseif we consider the referral
 that disappeared was a fake, too.
 What do you mean?
 But that referral was always here.
 So it was Genno himself
 who came here to work withthat referral thirty years ago.
 Oh!
 That is to say…probably.
 At that time, he used a referral
 that couldn’t be distinguishedfrom the real thing.
 And then he went to the troubleof making one
 that would be recognized asa fake if compared with that one.
 Why?
 Even with old referrals,
 he would be discoveredif reinvestigated again.
 So he got rid of it right afteryou blew the whistle on him.
 In order to conceal the fact thathe worked here thirty years ago.
 It’s because at that time in the village,
 he set as many Paper Bombsas were available.
 Why?
 Why’d you do such a thing?!
 Long ago, there was a village
 called Heat Devil Village inthe Land of Mountains.
 This is the village where I was born.
 Heat Devil Village?
 You don’t know it?
 No…
 The only thing recorded inthe Bingo Book you brought
 is that Genno’s homeland isthe Land of Mountains.
 To be precise, Heat Devil Villagein the Land of Mountains.
 The village itself vanished,
 so it probably ended upnot being recorded.
 Thirty years ago,
 the Village Hidden in Leavesand Heat Devil Village were at war.
 Neither side didn’t give an inchand the battle was in deadlock.
 We launched a successful sneak attackon Heat Devil Village,
 taking advantage of the absenceof their main forces.
 The tide of the war turned tothe Leaf’s advantage in one shot.
 The only thing writtenin the history books
 is that an armistice was concludedthree months after that.
 These three months are what’s peculiar.
 Heat Devil Village should’ve been thinkingabout a counterattack
 before accepting a cease fire.
 Here it is.lt’s my dad’s diary from thirty years ago.
 Really?
 Yeah. It seems he left it faithfully.
 Here.
 Thanks.
 ""A middle-aged man fromthe Hidden Sand came
 ""with a master carpentry referral.""
 ""His skills aren’t great, but I decidedto hire him as I want manpower.""
 The date is one week afterthe Heat Devil Village attack.
 Then like you thought…
 Checkmate. This is Genno.
 It was my mission to infiltrate the Leaf
 and to set Paper Bombsthroughout the village.
 The operation was for the main forcesof Heat Devil Village
 to invade the Village Hiddenin the Leaves at the same time
 as the Paper Bomb explosionsand inflict a devastating blow.
 I went out to various sites andset Paper Bombs.
 The Leaf village did not have substantialAnbu Black Ops as they do now.
 So I was able to move about with ease.
 Right around the time whentwo and a half months had passed,
 I finished setting almost allof the Paper Bombs…
 and all that was left was to waitfor my comrades to attack.
 But my comrades never came.
 Why?
 The leader of Heat Devil Village whohad insisted on “do-or-die” resistance;
 lost his life in an accident.
 And the man who assumedthe position of leader in his place
 agreed to a ceasefire with the Leaf.
 What?
 ""Genno doesn’t show up at the scene.I wonder what the deal is.""
 He disappeared having leftbehind the Paper Bombs.
 As for me, my intention was toimmediately return to the Hidden Leaf.
 I thought the ceasefire would justbe a temporary thing anyway.
 But Heat Devil Village would nevergive me another mission.
 Two weeks after the ceasefire,
 the Village Hidden in the Vale launcheda sneak attack on Heat Devil Village
 and it was destroyed.
 No way!
 They were targeted at a moment
 when they were weariest fromthe battle with the Leaf.
 Their defenses were probablyalso down due to the ceasefire.
 ""Two months has passed since…
 Where did Genno disappear off to…?""
 Then why come back to the Leaf Villagenow after all this time?
 You set Paper Bombs becauseit was your mission, right?
 If Heat Devil Village is no more,
 then there should be no reasonto go to the trouble of smashing the Leaf!
 Could it be…someone asked youto smash the Leaf?
 Rest easy.
 I haven’t been commissionedor commanded by anyone.
 Then why?
 How can I put this? It felt like a waste.
 A waste? What’s up with that?
 I’m getting old and I could be takento heaven any time now.
 If I were to die as is,
 I’d be buried in darkness withoutanyone learning of my traps.
 If so, then I thought I’d put themto good use before I die.
 Are you serious?
 You tried to kill people in the villagejust for that reason?
 I can’t believe that!
 Then treating me to ramen was to…
 It was to find out
 about the present stateof affairs in the Leaf.
 Damn you! You jerk!
 You’ll understand when you get older!
 I don’t understand!As for me…
 I won’t ever understand it!
 I’ll show you my final big jobas a Trapper!
 No way will I let you do that!
 My friends are now in the middleof removing all the Paper Bombs!
 I won’t let the bombs blow up!
 Sounds like quite a struggle.
 But who said I was going toblow up the Paper Bombs?
 What’re you talking about?You just said that before you die…
 I said I would put them to good use.You’re naïve, boy.
 What?
 I can put them to sufficiently good useeven without blowing them up.
 Katsu!
 A Shinobi reads twoor three moves ahead
 and prepares several movesin advance.
 Remember that!
 Shikamaru!
 What is it?
 The Academy students are sayingthey’re tired.
 What should we do?
 The Academy students?
 The Kunai Knife practice, right?
 What? They were still doing that?
 You idiot! You were the onewho had them do it.
 Oh, oh yeah. Then have themgo ahead wrap things up.
 Rather, it’d be trouble if they wereto get lucky and hit the center.
 Oh!
 What is it?
 I get it. So that’s it!
 It’s unnatural for a guy so prepared
 to casually entrust thefinal explosive device to pure luck.
 What do you mean?
 A Shinobi of Genno’s level should blowit up with the most effective timing.
 In other words,
 it doesn’t matter whetherthe Paper Bombs explode or not.
 It’s just a diversion.
 He’s really after something else!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say,“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”

 Spat at that beloved face!!Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key

 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feelin my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s fromthat coke I just drank?
 Choji, things might get pretty ugly.
 You’ve figured something out, huh?
 We need to contactthe Fifth Hokage.
 To not let the returning forcesenter the village.
 Got it! But… Why?
 If the Paper Bombs wereall a diversion,
 then the moment he makes his move
 is most likely whenthe main forces return!
 What?!
 Shikamaru! Choji! We’ve got trouble!
 What happened, Hinata?!

 I’ve done it!The water is turning!
 It seems it’s going to be easierthan I thought to break it.
 Then I’ll go take a little restuntil it’s done…with this.
 Hey! What is that?!
 I need it to kill the time.And also to get some sleep.
 Huh! The way it’s going,it won’t even be an afternoon nap!
 Is that so…?Call me when it is broken.
 Just wait!
 If it keeps up like this,I’ll learn it within today!
 Keep on Training!Pop Goes the Water Balloon
 Oh man! Why doesn’t it break!
 Huh? Are you done with it?
 Ah…well, it’s almost doneor how should I call it.
 Oh boy…
 It seems like I went beyondan afternoon nap and had a deep sleep.
 Hey, hey…how do I break it?
 Didn’t I tell you I can’t givea detailed explanation until it’s broken?
 All right, I understand…
 Naturally, you’re supposed to realize itthrough trial and error
 when mastering a Jutsu, but…
 Yeah, yeah.
 I guess I’ll teach you justa tiny bit on the Jutsu…
 You, try rotating the water!
 Oh, okay.
 Right or left…which direction did youimagine when you rotate it?
 Hmm…well, to the left…
 Hey, come over here.
 Okay…
 Huh, I thought so…
 W-What?
 You are in fact a right-rotation type.
 Right?
 In order to build up Chakra,
 it is necessary to blend the energy…
 Chakra							Spiritual energy       Physical energy		So everybody unconsciously builds up		Chakra inside the body by rotating it.55	01:54:25:29	01:54:29:20              Right                             Left		Whether the rotation at that point		is to the right or to the left
 differs in the individual.
 Therefore, if you imaginethe rotation of the water balloon
 opposite to that of your rotation-typein this training,
 your Chakra flow divides and resists
 and the momentum ofthe rotation does not get on track.
 You should be able to figurethat kind of stuff on your own.
 But how did you figure out thatI’m a right-type so fast?
 The cowlick on your head!
 It's pretty much determined that you’rea right type if a whorl rolls to the right
 and you’re a left-typeif it rolls to the left.
 It’s simple.
 Huh, so I have a right roll!
 Yes, so if you want to rotate it,you have to imagine a right rotation.
 I never really paid attentionthat until now…
 But this Jutsu is just the one for you.
 Hand sign is completely unnecessary.All you need is Chakra.
 There is no need to learna finicky hand sign!
 It’s okay to be stupid!
 I’m not stupid!
 I’m the man who’s eventually goingto become a Hokage!
 It’s easy once you understand!
 This Jutsu, I’ll completely master itif I got three days!
 Three days, huh?
 This Jutsu is a Ninjutsuthat the Fourth Hokage passed on to us.
 Huh…?
 It took him three whole yearsto perfect this Jutsu…
 This Jutsu is second from the top
 on the six degrees ofdifficulty in mastering…
 It’s an A-rank, super high-level Ninjutsu.
 In order to learn this move,there are three steps in the training.
 This “Water Balloon Breaking”is the first step.
 It took the genius Ninja,the Fourth Hokage…
 Three years…
 There’s no point in explaininganymore to someone
 who can’t even clear the first step.
 Do the rest by yourself!
 Take care!I’m going to return to the town.
 I have to gather some information…
 What will you do?
 A-rank in degree of difficultyin mastering…
 The Ninjutsu left behindby the Fourth Hokage…
 I’m not gonna go back yet!
 Huh…
 So long… Don’t go overboard with it.
 Now, what will happen?
 It’s something to be concerned about…
 Mister!
 Why don’t you stop by?
 This month is our special service month.
 Whoa! It’s a special service month?
 The more you visit,the more you benefit.
 Here you go, a stamp card!
 I’ll give you lots and lots of service!
 I’ll come, I’ll come!
 Hey! Come on down, Shu!
 Hey, hey, where is the toilet?
 I don’t have time to spend three years.
 All right now!
 Training, once again today!I’m gonna work hard like a blaze!
 Break! Break! Break!
 Why won’t it break?
 Little Jiraiya, you’re so naughty!
 Men are all naughty!
 Dang it!
 Three days have passed sinceI got the tip from that Pervy Sage…
 The rubber is stretched this much,but why won’t it break?
 What am I doing different fromthat Pervy Sage?
 This is great! This is so great!
 What the--?
 Whoa, he stinks of alcohol.
 I’m gonna eat now!
 Huh?
 What's the matter?
 Oh dang it!
 Darn it! Why is it like this?!
 No need to learn a finicky hand sign!lt’s okay to be stupid!
 He said that there’s no need to forma hand signal, but…
 Hey! That’s not your toy…
 This is it!
 Hurry up and wake up!Hey, you Pervy Sage!
 Uh… G-Good timing.
 Why don’t you bring me some water…
 Water?
 The first step is cleared!
 Cleared…?
 Well, let’s have you show it to me.
 All right! Watch it carefully!
 Left hand?
 Go!
 All right! See that?! See that?!
 You’re sleeping!
 Sorry, sorry.
 I’m tired from the days and nightsof gathering information.
 But that seems suspicious to begin with!
 You still stink of alcohol too!
 Nevertheless…
 You rotate the water inside the water balloonthat you hold in your left hand
 by repeatedly applying itwith your right hand…
 It seems little strange of an idea, but…
 You’re an interesting kid.
 You understood the trick pretty well.lt’s all thanks to me, though.
 It’s thanks to this guy!
 Huh?
 I realized after I saw this cat playingwith the water balloon.
 He kept on flicking it withhis paw many times
 and the water inside shockedin all different kinds of direction…
 Then it came to me like “bingo!”
 How did it come like “bingo”?
 The time when the Pervy Sagefirst showed me breaking it…
 I remembered how the water balloonsurface was not smooth.
 Until then,I was always only rotating the water
 in the one same direction…
 I realized that the Pervy Sage’swater balloon was not smooth
 because the water inside was rotatingin different directions.
 And after doing it in my own way,it broke!
 It seems it’s still not possible for you
 to rotate it violently with one hand, but…
 I suppose you thought it outin your own way.
 That’s just what he expected of me!
 Anyhow…The first step is complete for now.
 All right!
 Do you want to see it one more time?One more time!
 Oww!
 You used too much Chakra andit gradually reached the point
 where there’s burdenon the Chakra Network…
 But the next one won’t be like this!
 Okay. Now, we will proceedto the second step.
 Yeah!
 It seems like we can finally gointo some serious training!
 – Here you go! 					– Huh?
 Rubber ball?Something like this again?!
 Now, you’ll break this one!
 It’s one hundred times harderthan the water balloon!
 It’s hard…
 The first step is rotation,the second step is force.
 Since there is no water inside,
 it’s more difficult to imaginethe rotation of Chakra,
 so it becomes more difficultto rotate the Chakra as well.
 That’s true…
 I’ll leave that to your own judgment.
 I need to learn a trick againto do this, don’t I?
 Well then,I’ll go gather some information.
 Hey! Wait, wait!
 Let’s train together forthe first time in a while!
 I don’t mind if you take a nap.
 Don’t depend on me!
 You must have some kindof misunderstanding!
 I did say that I’ll teach you the Jutsu,
 but I don’t have the obligationto teach you every step of the way.
 If you can’t do it by yourself,then that’s it.
 Don’t be childish forever…Become more respectable like a Shinobi!
 Well, well then.
 If you can at least teach me…the trick again…
 Money!
 Money…money…money…
 W-What do you mean“be respectable like a Shinobi”?!
 Even though you say that,you’re an dirty and greedy adult!
 You’re not a respectable Shinobi at all!
 It’s way more difficult thanthe time with the water balloon…
 A-And…
 my hands and arms hurt.
 Dang it! How many days am Igoing to be doing the same thing!
 Second from the top in the difficulty of mastering…
 Don’t depend on me!
 You must have some kindof misunderstanding!
 Dang it!
 Hey, Naruto.
 What did you come here for?
 Go buy some food from the town below.
 What?! Why me?
 Hey you…
 Even if for a while, you’re stilllearning the Jutsu from me.
 Here you go, thanks for waiting.
 Thank you.
 How dare he put on a master’s faceonly at a time like this
 when he doesn’t teach me anything…
 Dad, buy me some ice cream.
 I want this one that cracks.
 Here.
 Why? I can eat all of it by myself.
 Nope, when you get home,your mother will have supper ready.
 Okay!
 Hey…you know…
 Huh?
 Can you be around my trainingfor just a while…today?
 I don’t have time for that.
 I have to immediately go to town.
 Unless you think for yourself andget a grip of the trick for yourself,
 it’ll never work.
 I thought I told you three weeks ago!
 Don’t be spoiled like a kid.You are a Ninja.
 I know that withoutyour telling me!
 Just thought I'd ask.
 Hurry up and go,you Pervy Sage!
 Oh no, little Jiraiya,you tell so many lies!
 What do you mean?!Everything is true!
 Dang it! It doesn’t breakno matter how much I try…
 I’m just dripping awaymy Chakra this way.
 Also…
 The more I increase the amount of flow,the worse the pain gets.
 But… How do I say it?
 If I don’t go all out as ifto explode the Chakra,
 it’s not going to break!
 That’s it!
 If I understand the amount of Chakrathat flows from the pain I feel…
 Then I can bear the pain to the limitand all at once…
 No, not yet…
 Not yet!
 Not yet…store it!
 Now!
 Oww!
 Hmm… There seems to have beena little progress.
 Humph!
 I’ve still only opened a holeand it hasn’t popped with a bang!
 Hey, don’t pretend to be so tough. Here!
 You’ve done well,all on your own power.
 It’s so good!
 Yes…
 Oh yeah. Maybe we’ll test a bit.
 What, what?
 Give me your right hand.
 What’s this?
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools
 He tells me ""focus, focus, focus!""
 But I've never been good at it, ever.
 Speaking of concentration,
 Iruka Sensei used to scold me oftenat the Ninja Academy
 for my lack of concentration.
 Oh…I would've listened to him betterif I knew this would happen.

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 Say, Grandma Tsunada,am I really so…?
 Come to think of it, recently I feel dull
 and I make more mistakes with Jutsu than before.
 And, what’s more, even worse…
 I can’t eat more than five ofthe large-size ramen noodles at Ichiraku…
 Might I perhaps havesome terrible illness?!
 Come on, and tell me.I’m prepared to hear the worst!
 You are in good health.
 Huh?
 Hey! That’s Bushy Brow’smedical record, isn’t it?
 Recently he’s been avoidinghis regular check-ups.
 Bring him in, will you?
 Huh? But, what about me…?
 You are stupid. That’s all!
 Be on your way!
 – Put your clothes back on, you idiot!– Yes!
 Unbelievable!
 How was it?
 I’m fit as a fiddle!
 I could tell that just by looking at you.
 What’s that all about?
 He doesn’t seem to be ina very good mood, does he?
 Oh, by the way,have you seen Bushy Brow?
 No, but I know where he is.
 These days,you can always find him here.
 Oh…
 2954… 2955…
 2956… 2957… 2958…
 That’s just amazing…
 Even after having surgeryfor the kind of injury
 that could prevent him fromcontinuing on as a Ninja…
 – Bushy Brow! 					– Lee!
 Bushy Brow!
 Lee…
 It’s nothing.
 Grandma Tsunada told me to bring youfor your regular check-up.
 It slipped my mind.I’ve been feeling fine lately, so I just…
 You don’t look like it though.
 HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL
 Rest for a while.
 You are forbidden from engaging inany missions or training for the duration.
 There is cumulative damageto your Chakra Network.
 You were once injured so badly
 that you had to give up on beinga Ninja for a while.
 It’s my self-rule.
 Your self-rule?
 Yes! To never forgetmy original intentions!
 As long as I keep on trying,I will be able to continue on as a Ninja!
 All right.
 I will remove you from active dutyfor a while,
 but you may continue training.Just don't overdo it.
 Yes!
 In particular,I prohibit you to use Hidden Lotus!
 Got that?
 Y-Yes…
 Oh! Hey, Bushy Brow, how did it go?
 What’s wrong? Hey!
 The results were bad.
 Judging from the way he looked,I’d say considerably…
 By “considerably,”do you mean that “considerably”?
 Yes.Considerable, to be sure.
 Considerable?!
 What are you so down about?! Lee!
 Guy Sensei!
 I heard the results of the exam.You have permission to train, don’t you?
 Yes, but the Hidden Lotus…
 That day, you were crying right there…
 Your surgery will be a success
 because you have worked hardall the way through.
 You have the power to bringyour own future in the heavens.
 And in the one in a thousand—
 no, one in a million chancethat something goes wrong…
 I’m going to die with you!
 Ever since the time I met you,
 my Way of Ninja has beenbringing you up to be a fine Ninja.
 I promise you!
 You believed me then and had the surgery.And it was successful.
 You must have faith in meone more time!
 If you can no longer use the Hidden Lotus,
 then strive to attain an evengreater technique through your efforts!
 There are no limits inthe face of your efforts.
 Sensei!
 You are a genius at effort!
 Yes, sir!
 I'll give you some training forthe first time in quite a spell!
 First, dash to the Academy practice hall!
 Please instruct me!
 If you don’t get there in ten seconds, it’s 500 push-ups!
 Right!
 The Third Super-Beast!
 It was rash of us to think we couldmake it in ten seconds, after all.
 Just as well!
 Five hundred…
 It’s been a long time since I smelled this smell…
 Who is he?
 That’s Yagura.He’s been here for a week.
 An acquaintance asked me to determinewhether he has aptitude as a Ninja.
 His name is Yagura, you say?
 He’s pretty good, isn’t he?
 Yes, he has the instincts for it.
 He absorbs the things I teach himlike sand absorbs water.
 Oh! You’re Rock Lee, aren’t you?
 Y-Yes…
 I hear that you have superb techniques.
 Sensei has told me about you.
 No, nothing that great…
 Don’t be bashful, you.
 – Master Guy? 					– Yes?
 I would like to receive some instruction from my senior.
 Fine, then. Begin!
 Huh?!
 Guy Sensei!
 You came to train, anyway.
 First, lend a bit of aid to your junior partner and warm up.
 I see…
 He’s a spring chick who has just arrived,so try not to let him get hurt.
 Right.
 What’s Bushy Brow doing in the Academy practice hall of all places?
 I thought his condition wasconsiderably bad!
 Yes, considerably! Considerably!
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?
 I’m inexperienced,but please instruct me.
 Oh, please bear with me, too.
 Now, Lee and Yagura, I want you bothto give it all you've got
 but to also observethe greatest courtesy.
 That is friendship!That is youth. Get ready. Fight!
 H-He’s fast!
 Let’s have you show me…
 The depth of the Taijutsu thatMight Guy drilled into you!
 What power!
 Every single blow is heavy!
 I haven’t the strength to absorb them!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Closing off the escape path above and strike from a low position…
 However…
 The Leaf Hurricane was defeated!
 Stop! Hold it right there!
 Lee! Are you all right?
 Pull yourself together, Bushy Brow!
 What was that that just happened?
 The Cross Method…
 Meeting the opponent’s kick
 and pinning his foot betweenthe knee and elbow simultaneously—
 a “bone-crushing daring technique .”
 Where on earthdid you learn that, Yagura!
 I didn’t intend to do that.
 My body just movedlike that involuntarily…
 Sorry, Lee. Are you all right?
 If Lee hadn’t been wearing his weights,his ankle would have been crushed.
 It was a splendid move.Well then, let’s continue with the practice.
 Let’s stop here for today.
 I’ll take you to the hospital tohave them look at it.
 No, I’m completely fine, I tell you…
 We knew from the health check-up
 that Bushy Brow’s injuries wereconsiderable to begin with, didn’t we?
 Considerable!
 What was considerable?
 I’m telling you,just considerable, right?!
 – Probably considerable…– Considerable, I tell you!
 Even with the weights on, that speed…
 What was considerable?!
 Fortunately, there’s nothing wrongwith the bone.
 I see.
 Um… When can I begin training again?
 Huh? What are you saying?!
 You’re going to need complete restfor a while.
 It’s amazing that your Achilles tendon remained uninjured, you know…
 You said considerable, so…
 I misunderstood it to mean thathe was in a considerable condition.
 But…
 he came out from the examining roomlooking very down,
 so I just assumed…
 To be sure, he seems dispirited.
 He was beaten by a traineewho isn’t even enrolled in the Academy.
 A trainee? Lee?
 Yes, a kid who has been studying Taijutsufor only one week.
 In any case,he was incredibly skilled, that…
 What’s it called…?
 The Cross Method!
 Yes, that!
 He's a genius to deploythat at the instant!
 I hope Lee isn’t feeling down, though.
 If he were the kind of guy to getdownhearted about a thing like that,
 Lee would have quit beinga Shinobi a long time ago.
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 When Lee was in the Academy,
 he was told that he had neitherthe talent for Ninjutsu,
 nor any talent for Genjutsu.
 Had it been me,I would have given up long ago.
 But Lee got to where he is now purelythrough effort and persistence.
 If he can just heal his injuries,
 he’ll soon outstrip anyone withnatural talent alone.
 – That’s true.– Darn right!
 But…
 I’ve heard that if you train too hard,
 you can wreck your body andbecome a decrepit…
 Don't say such a thing!You’re talking about Bushy Brow!
 I’m only kidding.Just a slip of the tongue.
 – Don’t even say that in jest!– Decrepit?
 I know, I know.
 But actually, we are grateful to Lee.
 Huh? Grateful?
 Yes, grateful.
 Okay, today I’m going to teach youabout self-rule.
 Self…
 …rule, you say?
 Yes! Yes! Yes!
 Please teach me! Me! Me!
 All right, ready?
 To all things there are principles,
 and to efficiently make use of thingsin daily life, human beings have rules.
 Okay, today I have something goodto give you all.
 – Something… 					– …good?
 This!
 O-Oh!
 These tights of the type thatI habitually use…!
 They have outstanding ventilationand moisture-wicking properties!
 Developed for ultimate ease of movement,it's a complete of of super-athletic wear!
 If you wear them when you’re training,you’ll feel the difference immediately!
 You won’t be able to do without them!
 Next thing you know,you’ll be wearing them all the time!
 Yes, yes, yes!Please, by all means, give me a pair!
 Oh, I got a pair of those myself.They look cool, don’t they?
 Oh… Is that so?
 If it weren’t for Lee…
 This is youth!
 This is guts!
 This is Harutaro Minami,spring chicken of the South!
 – You got that all wrong!– You got that all wrong!
 I’m really glad that we’ve had Lee around.
 Yeah, me too…
 I’m sure a C-rank mission wouldfeel insufficient for you,
 but there’s nobody left to ask but you.
 Leave it to me.
 Oh, by the way,there’s someone I’d like to take with me…
 Yagura!
 When my foot heals,let’s train together aga--?
 I feel no need to take lessons from you.
 Even ruling out the fact thatyou were wearing weight,
 there seems to be nothing worthstealing from you…
 Stealing?
 After all, skills acquiredpurely through effort
 make you nothingbut a pale imitation of Guy Sensei.
 What did you say?!
 As proof of that,even Sensei has given up on you.
 That can’t be!
 Guy Sensei promised me…
 that his own Way of Ninja was toturn me into a splendid Ninja, too!
 Well then, I wonder why he’s goneso far as to ask me
 to come on a mission with himfor practical training…
 Not you, but me!
 You?
 Too bad. There’s no way effortcan win out over talent.
 Wait!
 Did Sensei really asked you to…?
 No, it…can’t be true…
 Lady Tsunade!
 Wh-What is it?
 Yagura has been injured andis under protection.
 What? Guy was with him.What on earth happened?
 No! Yagura is said to have been attackedbefore reaching Hidden Leaf Village.
 Then the trainee Yagurathat accompanied Guy is…
 A total imposter.
 Damn it, one nuisance after another…!
 So, these three are the onesthat can be mobilized?
 What shall we do?
 Fine! Have Neji, Tenten, and Naruto…
 these three go after Guyand the phony Yagura!
 Right!
 Wait!
 Have Sakura keep an eye on Lee.
 If he learns about this,
 he’s apt to dash out,even in the shape he’s in.
 Right!
 Are you sure that Intense Brow Senseiwent this way?
 Without a doubt!
 His destination wasthe Land of Mountain Streams.
 He must have gone through this forest.
 There’s another way to go,cutting through the mountains,
 but it’s too dangerous.
 Yagura, are you with me?
 Yes, Guy Sensei!
 Don’t slow down!
 Take each step after first takingthe measure of the mountain terrain!
 Right!
 Lee could run through here blindfolded.
 What’s wrong? Yagura?
 Oh no!
 Yagura! Where are you?! Yagura!
 Yagura!
 He may be a genius,but he’s still a trainee…
 I wonder if I expectedtoo much from him…
 Yagura!
 What? Were you in such a place?
 Wooden Training Dummiesfor kung fu training…
 Oh my… It takes me back to my youth.
 I trained with a burning spirit onthe same kinds of Wooden Dummies.
 It makes my body to just startmoving uncontrollably.
 But why are there Wooden Dummiesin such a place?
 Who in the world…?
 And for what purpose?
 They move well for dummies.
 But, after all, they just looklike automated dolls.
 They only have one pattern of movement,
 and no matterhow many of them there are,
 their reach only extends fora diameter of 3.5 meters,
 so they cannot attack.
 What? Mister, you can move?!
 What the heck?!
 Hey? Can’t you see anything yet? Neji!
 Even using the Byakugan,I can’t find a single footprint.
 They can’t have gotten that far away,can they?
 They wouldn't have used excessivelydangerous mountain paths either…
 However they seem to be able to move,
 they’re just stick figures crawlingover the surface of the ground…
 Mister, you can jump, too?!
 Not just yet!
 Wh-What a…!
 pleasant, high-energy training place…!
 6,985… 6,986… 6,987… 6,988
 6,989… 6,990… 6,991…
 – There is no limit to training.– 6,992…
 – Even if I cannot use my legs,– 6,993…
 – my upper half is still in good shape.– 6,994…
 – Guy Sensei thinks…– 6,995…
 – my training is inadequate.– 6,996…
 – That’s why he compared me with Yagura.– 6,997… 6,996…
 – to show me that I wasn't doing enough.– 6,998… 6,999…
 7,000!
 – I have faith in Guy Sensei!– 7,001… 7,002…
 They’re moderately powerful, but…
 their movements are monotonous.
 Or…so I thought…!
 Shall I say I am outnumbered?There seems to be no limit to them!
 Wh-What is this sound?
 What?!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say,“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!!Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stagedoes bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feelin my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s fromthat coke I just drank?
 I thought I knew,but you do have incredible power, after all.
 To think you have suchan amazing kick.
 Looks like I have to put outeverything in myself.
 Then I would put everythingI've got into this too.
 Fine! Why don’t  you come at mewith intent to beat me?!
 Please forgive me Guy Sensei.
 But to me, this is the moment…
 – to follow through with my own Ninja Way!– to follow through with my own Ninja Way!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 You're an embarrassmentto our village.
 Why do you think we came allthe way here to Leaf Village?
 P-Please listen to me, Gaara.
 T-They lashed out first…
 Shut up!
 I'll kill you.
 U-Understood, I was wrong.
 I-I'm sorry…I'm really sorry.
 I'm sorry about that…
 This guy…has a nasty look.
 To think he was able to hitthat Kankuro
 with a tiny rock with great ease.
 This guy's…good.
 Let's go.
 We didn't come hereto play around.
 I know.
 Hold it!
 What is it?
 Judging from your headbands,
 you're Ninjas from the VillageHidden in the Sand, right?
 Without question, the Land of Fire andthe Land of Wind are allied nations.
 But the arbitrary coming andgoing of Shinobi
 is supposed tobe prohibited by the treaty.
 State your purpose!
 Depending on circumstances…
 Hmph! So this is what they mean
 by the darkest place beingunder the candlestick.
 Don't you know anything about it?
 My permit!
 As you say, we're Sand Village Geninsfrom the Land of Wind.
 We came to this village totake the Chunin Exam.
 Chunin Exam…?
 Identify Yourself:Powerful New Rivals
 What is the Chunin Exam anyways?
 You really don't knowanything, do you?
 Bro, if you pass the exam,you can become a Chunin from a Genin!
 I see! Then, maybe I'll try taking them!
 Heh!
 Hey! You there…
 What's your name?
 Huh?  M-Me?
 No! The gourd next to you!
 I'm Gaara of the desert…
 I have an interest in you as well…
 What's your name?
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 Say! Say! What about me?What about me?
 Not interested.
 Heh! Things have gotten interesting.
 Konohamaru, do I look weak?
 Compared to Sasuke, yes...
 Sasuke, I won't lose to you!
 What's gotten into you,all of a sudden?!
 What do you think?
 I don't think they're anything special.
 But the black-haired one from Leaf Villageand the gourd from the Sand Village…
 those two need to be checked.
 Now then, in conjunctionwith beginning the Chunin Exam,
 let us first have those in chargeof the rookie Genin come forward.
 Kakashi and Kurenai and Asuma…
 So?  Are there any Genin fromyour squads
 you wish to recommendfor these exams?
 It goes without saying,
 but if it's a Genin who has carried outeight or more formal missions,
 you can recommend themfor the exams if you wish.
 Well, as a general rule,
 having carried out more than twicethat amount of missions is appropriate.
 There's no need to hear this…
 It's too soon for them.
 Then, you first Kakashi.
 The Kakashi-led Group Seven...
 Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto Uzumaki.Sakura Haruno.
 I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend thesethree for the Chunin Exam.
 Huh?
 The Kurenai-led Group Eight...
 Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka,Shino Aburame.
 These three, I, Kurenai Yuhi,recommend the same.
 The Asuma-led Group Ten...
 Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara,Choji Akimichi.
 These three, I, Asuma Sarutobi,recommend the same.
 All three recommended…
 To think rookies will bein the Chunin Exam…
 Hasn't it been five yearssince that's happened?
 Hmm…
 Wait a minute!
 What is it, Iruka?
 Lord Hokage, please let mesay one thing.
 This may be presumptuous,
 but as for the nine namesthat were given,
 I was in charge of them at the Academy.
 Admittedly, they were all studentswith ability,
 but it's too soon…!
 They should be tested afterhaving gained more experience!
 I became a Chunin when I wassix years younger than Naruto is now.
 Naruto is different from you!
 Is it your intent to crush Naruto?!
 They always do nothing but complainabout important missions…
 Teaching them a lessononce would be fun.
 Trying to crush themwould be interesting, too.
 W-What did you say?!
 Well, joking aside…
 Iruka Sensei...
 I understand what you want to say.
 It's aggravating, I know.However…
 Kakashi...
 Don't do it.
 Stay out of this!They're not your students anymore!
 Now they're my subordinates!
 Man…troublesome people.
 B-But the Chunin Examis also known as…
 Iruka…
 I understand your point.
 Master Hokage...
 Therefore, I have decided to conduct
 a special preliminary examfor these rookie Genins.
 P-Preliminary exam…?!
 Say! Say! Say!
 Why is it that he's the one whoalways calls us out,
 and then makes us wait?!
 That's right! That's right!
 What's he going to do aboutthe feelings of a maiden
 who accidentally overslept and resignedherself to no blow-drying?!
 I overslept, so I haven't washed my faceand didn't brush my teeth.
 Y-You…That's dirty.
 Why're these guys so hyperfirst thing in the morning?!
 Hey, good morning, folks!
 Today, I got a bit lost on the path of life…
 Right! That's a lie!!
 Uh, well…
 This is sudden, but I recommendedyou guys for the Chunin Exam, so…
 Here, these are your applications.
 Chunin Exam…
 That being said, the recommendationsare not compulsory.
 You guys are free to decide whetheryou take the Exam or not.
 All right! I love you, Kakashi Sensei!
 Hey, cut it out. Get away already…
 Only those who want to take the Exam,sign that application and
 come to Room 301 of the Academyat 3:00 p.m. five days from now…
 That's it!
 Chunin Exam! Chunin Exam!
 Chunin Exams, eh…
 I bet lots of strong guys would be there…
 For example, that guy!
 And this guy!
 Okaaay! I won't lose toanybody no matter what!
 If I take the first place, the path tothe Hokage is right there!
 Sure enough, it's decided that Narutowill be the Hokage…
 I'll just retire my elderly self at once.
 Yaaaay!
 I might be able to fight him.
 I...don't want to…
 Here I can't…
 keep up with Sasuke,and not even with Naruto…
 The Chunin Exam, no way…
 Oh, Brother Naruto! Let's play!
 Sure. I don't have any missions today,so I'll play with you guys!
 Yaaay!
 Oh!
 Leader! Konohamaru!
 What're you going to do with Moegi?!
 Hey, you! Let Moegi go!
 Darn!Let's follow them, Konohamaru!
 Y-Yeah!
 W-Wait!
 Chunin Exams, eh…
 Yo.
 S-Sasuke, what's up?
 How about we go for a little walk?
 No way! For real?!
 Well well... So you can keep upat this speed, eh?
 Wait for me! Moegi!
 Bro, where'd you go?
 I think we are lost.
 Nooo! Let me go!
 Even the strongly fortifiedVillage Hidden in the Leaf…
 is mine if I slip in themiddle of Chunin Exam's ruckus.
 Hmm?
 That was fast…
 Hey! You fat old man!
 What're you going to do with Moegi?
 What am I going to do, you ask?
 You want to know?
 Wha--?!
 Don't move!
 If you do,the brat's dead meat!
 Y-You. Why're you doing this?!
 I want the first Hokage'sScroll of Sealing!
 If you bring it to me,I'll return the brat!
 Scroll of Sealing…
 Umm…
 Sasuke…
 What's up, all of a sudden?
 Sakura…
 Give up on the Chunin Exam…lt's too early for you.
 Is it…?
 I thought so…
 The Chunin Exam isa gathering of top dogs…
 You might die if you're not careful…
 Sasuke…
 So you're worried about me, right?
 Yeah…kind of…
 What a display of affection, eh?
 Get lost! If you don't want to die.
 Don't talk as if you know everything!
 Don't make me angry!
 Sasuke!
 Don't take me lightly!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke?
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!!
 What're you doing?
 Hurry up and bring methe Scroll of Sealing!
 What'll happen…if I say, heck no?
 You don't care what happensto this brat?
 Heh, I'm fine with whatever happensto that bunch of straw, I say.
 Wha--?!When did he do that?!
 I've taken Moegi back from you,thank you!
 As expected great leader!Moegi respects you.
 Darn it! The Clone Jutsu, huh…?
 You don't know when to give up!
 Naruto!
 Hey! You're late, Konohamaru!
 Konohamaru, I was scared.
 Oh, there-there…
 Leader, did you catch him?
 Yup, as you can see!
 Huh?  What?!
 Oh, it's the Substitution Jutsu!
 Dang it! When did he switch?!
 I see…
 If you don't want to turn outlike this,
 you'll give up onthe Chunin Exam, too.
 Sasuke, don't die…!
 Big mistake if you thinkI'd say that.
 I was aware of this Genjutsuright from the start!
 What?!
 The real Sasuke wouldn't dosomething like
 invite me to go for a walk!
 Don't make me saysuch frustrating things!
 That kind of elementary Genjutsuwon't work on me!
 Did you say elementary…?
 That's right!
 Incidentally, I've seen through thatyou're also an illusion
 and aren't really here!
 I don't know about…
 that!
 See?
 Just what I'd expect ofKakashi's subordinate.
 However, this will become realityin the Chunin Exam!
 I wonder if you can endure that…?
 I'm not scared!I'll take them on anytime!
 The Chunin Exam isn't...The Chunin Exam isn't…!
 I'm still not sure if I can do it…
 That was a stupid thing to do…
 How was it?
 We went to the trouble of havinga special preliminary exam,
 but all nine of the rookies passed.
 As you say, it appears their skillshave definitely improved.
 Well, the actual Chunin Examwon't just end at this, but...
 Hey, have you heard?
 Rookies are going to bein the Chunin Exam
 for the first time in five years.
 No way.
 It's probably just a Jonin battle of willsor something anyway.
 No…
 The story is that three among themare that Kakashi's unit.
 That's interesting…
 Well, be that as it may…
 That's a sad story…
 Sakura, you're late!
 Yeah…sorry…
 Morning, Sasuke.
 Yeah…
 Something's strange about Sakura.
 So, are you sure you're goingto attempt taking
 the Chunin Exam with that skill?
 May it'd be best if you runts quit.
 You're green-assed brats, after all.
 Please let us through.
 That's…mean…
 What did you say?!
 Listen!We're being nice to you!
 The Chunin Exam is a high hurdle.
 Many times have we seenpeople quit Shinobi
 as well as people who weredisabled for life
 just because they took this Exam.
 Also, a Chunin is at the levelof a unit leader.
 Mission failures,death of subordinates,
 it's all part of theresponsibilities of a leader!
 A brat such as this a Chunin?
 What's so bad about weeding outthose who won't pass anyway?!
 A just argument.
 However, you will let me through.
 And could you also immediatelyundo this barrier created with Genjutsu?
 I have business on the third floor.
 What's this guy talking about…?
 I don't know…
 – Well, well…– So you noticed, eh?
 How about it, Sakura?
 You should've beenthe first one to realize it.
 Huh…?
 Your analytical strength andGenjutsu know-how
 has improved the most in our squad, so...
 Sasuke…
 Thank you…
 Of course. I realized it ages ago!
 You see, this is the second floor!
 Yup!
 Well, not bad…But all you've done is to catch on.
 Right?!
 H-He's fast!
 This person…
 He's a different person fromwhen he was getting punched before!
 He stopped my kick…
 What's with that Chakra in his arm?
 Hey, this isn't what you promised.
 You were the one who said
 you didn't want to carelesslyattract attention and be watched.
 But…
 Oh boy… 					This again…
 This guy…
 The marks where he was hitare disappearing.
 Was he faking?
 My name's Rock Lee.Your name's Sakura, right…?
 Huh?
 Please go out with me!I'll protect you until I die!
 Absolutely…not.
 Huh?
 You're... too intense.
 Hey, you there.
 Identify yourself.
 Dang it! Again?
 It's always about Sasuke!
 When asking someone his name,give your own name first.
 You're... a rookie, right?How old are you?
 I'm not obliged to answer.
 What…?
 Cute.
 Too intense, huh…
 Uninterested, huh…
 Now then!Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!
 So those are Kakashi andGuy's treasured brats.
 Well, for the time being,their applications will pass.
 Yeah…
 It appears this year's test-takerswill be amusing…
 For us proctors too, eh.
 Good grief…
 This Chunin Exam…is full of monsters.
 Bowl-cut, fuzzy eyelashesand bushy eyebrows.
 Oh! It's you!
 You're the overly intense guywho just got rejected by Sakura.
 What's with your bizarregreen jumpsuit?
 What? You want to challenge me,bushy-browed bumpkin?
 I'll teach you that it's a million yearstoo soon to be doing that.

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Where is... this place...?
 Who is it?
 Me... 					from long ago?
 Father and mother didn’t need to die!
 Everyone was killed.
 I had no power so...
 the clan vanished.
 Battle Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!
 Ino... Why?
 I can’t let you upstage mein front of Sasuke!
 Squirming again...
 The Leaf Village worms wandered in.
 What are the two of you thinking?!
 They’re bad news!
 It’s a pain, but it can’t be helped!
 Ino steps out andwe men should run?
 Sorry to get you involved.
 But anyway we’rea Three-Man Squad, after all.
 We’re all in this together, aren’t we?
 Well, we’ll see.
 No! I don’t want to die yet!
 Let go of my scarf!
 You’re annoying! Quit wiggling!
 It’s okay for you to drop out, fatso.
 What did that guy just say?
 I....didn’t quite catch it.
 Huh?!
 That word is taboo to Choji.
 Try saying it again...
 I said if you have a problem,pull out, fatso.
 Fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso
 I’m not fat, I’m just big-boned!Blast it!
 Hurraaaay for Big-Boned!
 W-Wow...
 All right! You understand this, right?!
 This is a battle between Leaf and Sound!
 Lucky! He’s lost it!
 No way, this looks like it’s goingto be a pain in the butt.
 That’s my line.
 I was told to get Sasukeby the end of the test...
 Sasuke...
 Sakura...
 The two behind...take care of them.
 Okay!
 Well then, Team Ino,let’s go full throttle!
 Right!
 Formation Ino!
 – Shika! 					– Cho!
 I’m counting on you, Choji
 Okay!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Next, Leaf Style Taijutsu!
 Human Boulder!
 What is this Jutsu?
 Isn’t it just a fat guy rolling?
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 You!
 He jumped?!
 The air pressure ofSlicing Sound Wave
 is less than effectiveagainst that rotation.
 Even if I do the Super Sound Wave,if I’m touched by something like that
 the bones in my arms will be crushed!
 Think I’ll let you?!
 You’re the most annoying so...
 Ninja Art!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 My body!
 Huh?!
 Dosu?!
 What are you doing at a time like this?!
 Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?
 Ino, next it’s just the ladies.
 Okay, Shikamaru, look after my body.
 Gotcha!
 Huh?
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 Shoot!
 Kin!
 What happened?
 This... is the end of it.
 You guys!
 If you make one move, this girl named Kin is dead meat!
 If you don’t want thisto end right here,
 leave your scroll and walk away!
 Once you’ve gone far enough thatI can’t feel your Chakras,
 I’ll release this girl!
 These guys...What are they grinning about?
 – Choji! 					– Yeah!
 This isn’t good! They won’t...!
 Ino!
 Uggghh. I’m dizzy.
 W-What kind of person...hurts their own comrades?
 Careless.
 Our goal is not the scrolls orto pass this test playing by the rules.
 What?
 It’s Sasuke.
 Humph...
 My Jutsu...
 So your much preciousShadow Paralysis Jutsu
 is limited to 5 minutes?
 It’s not Shadow Paralysis.lt’s Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 In addition, it seems thatthis girl’s Jutsu...
 seems to be a Jutsu totake over the other’s body.
 From the looks of the bloodshe’s spitting up,
 if I kill Kin, that girl will die too...
 Are you going to do in...your teammate?
 If I need to...
 This is no good.
 Shoot...
 That’s too bad...you’re just a step away.
 You’re too easy-going.
 Hmph, I don’t like this at all.
 You minor Sound Ninjas...
 Bullying the second-rate guys andputting on airs like a winner.
 What?!
 They're Lee’s teammates...
 Lee!
 You goofed.
 Hah! Coming out of nowherelike cockroaches...
 That kid with the bob lying over thereis on our team, but...
 But you messed with him, didn’t you?!.
 What’s with his eyes?
 It’s like they see through everything...
 If you’re gonna continue, I’ll fight with full strength!
 Huh?
 What ‘s wrong? Neji...
 This Chakra...
 If you don’t like me,don’t play cool, come down here.
 No. Evidently, there’s no need for that.
 After all...
 without power...
 I can’t do anything!
 Because I had no power...Everyone was killed!
 No...You let them be killed.
 You only... watched.
 If only I had power...
 If only I had power...
 Sasuke! You’re awake...Huh?!
 Huh?
 That’s...
 Sasuke?
 Sakura...
 Sakura...
 Who did this to you?
 Who is it?
 The Curse Marks runaround his entire body?!
 Sasuke... 					That body...?
 Don’t worry.
 On the contrary,strength is rapidly flowing in...
 Right now I feel good.
 That guy gave this to me.
 Huh?
 At last I understand...
 I’m an Avenger...
 On my road, I must put powerinto my hands...
 even if it means abandoningmyself to the devil.
 So... I see...
 So the mark on the neckthat this girl called Sakura spoke of
 is this Curse Mark.
 But...
 I didn’t think he could stand up...
 Sakura, tell me...
 Who harmed you...?
 Me!
 Huh?
 Ino!
 If you stay like thatyou’re gonna get involved!
 Come back to this body!
 Choji, you too,come over here and hide.
 Y-Yeah.
 Uh-oh.
 Release!
 Okay, she’s back!
 Shikamaru!
 What’s going to happen now?
 How should I know?
 Wha--?!
 W-What’s this...?
 No matter...
 how you look at it....
 his Chakras are...
 too big!
 Dosu, this half-dead bastardis nothing to be scared of!
 Stop, Zaku! Don’t you understand?!
 I’ll take care of all of them...
 in one fell swoop!
 Super Sonic Slicing Wave!
 Heh! He must have been blown to pieces.
 – Who did? 					– Huh?!
 Zaku!
 He’s fast!
 Moreover, he took in those two,and in the blink of an eye.
 Fire Style!
 Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 Don’t push your luck!
 I’ll blow them off!
 What?!
 Shuriken’s in the fire?!
 Zaku, below you!
 The quality of the Chakra is completely different...
 Is that really Sasuke?
 What happened?What in the world...?
 It seems like you’reproud of your arms...
 You!
 S-Stop it!
 Sasuke will definitely come for me.
 You’re the only one left.
 You...
 make it a little more fun for me.
 This isn’t...
 This isn’t...
 This is not like...
 Sasuke!
 S-Stop!!
 Stop it.
 Please...
 Stop.
 The Curse Mark is withdrawing...
 We’re saved for now.
 Sasuke!
 You’re strong.
 Sasuke... We can’t defeat youthe way you are now.
 This is our fee for settling this...
 Please let us withdraw from here.
 Huh?
 It seems selfish, but we now havesomething we need to confirm, too.
 That being said,let’s make a promise.
 If there’s another opportunity tobattle with you in this test,
 we won’t run or hide.
 Wait!
 Who in the world is Orochimaru?
 What did he do to Sasuke?!
 Why Sasuke?!
 I don’t know...
 We were just given orders tomake the hit on Sasuke.
 Though you ordered us toassassinate Sasuke,
 you got to him first.
 Moreover, you didn’t kill him,and left that Curse Mark instead.
 I don’t know what you’re thinking...
 Hey! Are you okay?!
 It’s a pain, but Ino,I’ll leave Lee to you.
 Got it.
 That Chakra...lt’s abnormal.
 The Uchiha clan...this good, huh?
 Sakura’s in danger!
 It’s okay...I’ll protect Sakura.
 Well, what should we dowith this guy?
 Kick him awake?
 Can I do it?
 What am I...?
 Sasuke...
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.

 I wonder if he’s okay.
 Don’t worry…He wouldn’t get bumped off so easily.

 What is that…Jutsu?
 Reanimation.
 It’s a Forbidden Summoning Jutsuthat can bring the dead back to this world.
 The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsuis that it uses the blood of the caster.
 But I’ve heard that with this Jutsu,
 in order to summona dead soul to this world…
 the body of a living person is sacrificedas a container for the soul.
 Then, the bodies of those twoare of the sacrificed…
 Right…
 Perhaps dust and dirt coverthe sacrificial body
 and take on the original formof the summoned soul.
 And by way of the charmembedded in the head,
 the personality of the soul is killed
 and it morphs into no morethan a killing puppet.
 They’re complete.
 They look like how they usedto look more than ever.
 Do you know the joy and senseof accomplishment
 of hurting one whomyou once called Sensei?
 I prepared this scenarioso that you might know that joy.

 Okay… Got it!
 Transform!

 Wow… What level of Ninjutsu battle!
 This is Hokage level!
 Oh well…Things have finally gotten interesting.
 That's one of his Snake Swords.
 Let’s do it, Enma!
 No matter how strong the body,the Snake Sword still hurts.
 You’re mine!
 Lord Hokage!
 So foolish…
 To think you’d strike without evenusing the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 No, that’s not it.
 It's not that he didn't use it.He can’t use it.
 The amount of Chakra the Third Hokagehas differs from the past.
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu thatevenly disperses Chakra,
 if things go wrong,would be like throwing away Chakra.
 Sure enough, is it age?!
 Are you okay, Sensei?
 Please hang in there.
 You are called…
 “the Professor who knows and uses allof the Jutsu existent in Leaf Village,” right?
 Please don’t disappoint me too much.
 Please get up, Lord Hokage…!
 And please save the Leaf Village!

 Now’s the time to draw the line.
 Orochimaru…
 You…fool!
 Orochimaru…
 This is the end.
 I’ll snap your neck.
 As I thought…
 It looks like there’s no point ifI don’t do something about the soul itself
 that is bound by the Reanimation.
 If so, all I can do is to use…the Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu.
 Lord First Hokage, Lord Second Hokage,please forgive me for using that Jutsu!
 Sensei…it seems you’re out of breath.
 You’ve gotten old, haven’t you?
 I’ve never seen such a pained look.
 What’s so funny?
 It’s quite sad…
 Old age beats even you,once renowned as the god of Shinobi.

 Who the heck is that youth?
 Who the heck are you?!

 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 I guess the storm isgoing to come soon…
 Let’s hurry and head backto the curry shop.
 Oh my.
 That thunder right now…
 came from the directionof the Katabami Gold Mine…
 Raiga's Counterattack
 B-Boss.
 R-Ranmaru!
 Hey, wake up, Ranmaru!
 Quit joking around.I’m not laughing…
 Hey…Ranmaru…!
 You… What did you doto Ranmaru?
 N-No! He…
 When Ranmaru held your hand…
 you revived and…
 And then…Ranmaru…
 Ranmaru…
 Why is Raiga up?!
 I must stop him.
 Thunder?
 Could it be?!
 You’re slow!
 Are you…that brat’s comrade…?
 If it’s a wooden weapon, then…
 But I can’t hold it over my head…
 You’re annoying!
 You little fly…!
 Quit buzzing!
 I’m…not smart, you know…
 Huh…?
 I don’t know why this happened…
 Hey, whose fault is it? Yours?!
 N-No! That’s not true!
 Perhaps…the guys from the Leaf…
 Oh yeah…lf they didn’t come,
 then Ranmaru and I wouldhave been together forever…
 Where are they?!
 You know, don’t you?!lf you don’t know, I’ll kill you!
 I know…
 Maybe…!
 Take me…where they are…
 Go!
 Yes!
 Hold on, Ranmaru.For your funeral…
 I’ll offer up their corpses for you.
 Ranmaru…
 This child… Did he give up his lifein order to revive Raiga?
 Rai…ga… Rai…
 Ranmaru! You're alive!
 Hang in there! Ranmaru!
 Ranmaru!
 It started raining.
 But we’re almost done.
 Oh my, I’m happy thatyou all did this much for me.
 Oh no!
 Mom! Something horrible happened!
 Oh my… What happened, Karashi?
 Tenten is…!
 What happened to Tenten?
 She…fell from a cliff and..
 What?!
 What do you mean?!
 I was running with her and
 Tenten said that she would train mein place of Lee…
 But there…when we wereapproaching the Lightning Pass,
 the lightning struck anda tree came falling and
 Tenten fell from the Passto the bottom of the cliff!
 Oh my! Then you must gohelp her out immediately!
 Let’s go to help, Tenten!
 Yeah!
 Umm… No, I will…
 I will come after you guyswith the first-aid kit.
 Okay.
 Let’s go, Naruto, Lee.
 – Yes! 					– Right!
 Oh my, Karashi?
 Mom, we’re running awayfrom here.
 What are you saying, child?!
 Never mind that!
 I’ll explain it later,so hurry up and get ready.
 I will wait at the Lightning Pass.
 Bring them for sure. If not…
 I’ll offer up you and your mom’s corpsesto Ranmaru…
 Mom, please!
 I don’t want to!
 I'm going to waituntil everybody comes back!
 Mom! You are so stubborn!
 Just come with me!
 Do you think that Tenten wouldfall off a cliff
 merely because of the thunder?
 Huh? What do you mean?
 That Karashi…lt seems like he wasn’t trained enough.
 I’m sorry…
 Then…
 Perhaps…it’s some kindof trap again.
 Or he’s been threatenedby someone…
 But the Kurosuki Family is…!
 Maybe my eyes were cloudy…
 No way!
 It’s him…
 He’s burning up with fever…
 Raiga…?
 He revived, so you should too…
 It’s all right. I’m going to diesoon anyway.
 No way! I’m not going to let you saythat you're going to die so easily!
 The people who were killed by youand Raiga died against their will!
 I’m not going to let it go your way!
 For the sake of thosewhose freedoms you took away.
 I’m going to have youtake responsibility!
 Are you okay?
 The storm… It’ll be dangerousto stay here…
 To Grandma’s place.
 You’ve come!
 Raiga!
 So he is alive.
 This time I’ll take you down for sure!
 Let’s go!
 That’s not good! Lee!
 What are you…?
 What is this?
 It’s in a whole different levelfrom before…!
 Probably that attack waslightning made of Chakra.
 But this one…
 Real lightning is used as the source…
 If he can utilize the power of nature,unlike Chakra, he’ll have no limits!
 Get down!
 Byakugan!
 If we dodge throughthe electric shock and
 take this to a close-range battle…
 Naruto!
 I know it!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Good job, Naruto!
 Gentle Fist!
 Neji!
 You brats! Is that all you know?
 Unlike the natural thunder powerI’m using,
 Chakra has its limits!
 Huh…?
 You’re an idiot!There’s an idiot here!
 Is that what you say to an opponentwho fought with all his power?!
 Huh?
 You again…
 This time I’m not going tohave a funeral for you!
 I am angry.
 Oh my, what are you doing?!
 Please Mom, come with me!
 There’s no time.
 No, I’m going to stay here!
 Oh Tenten!
 Oh my! This stupid son of mine!
 I couldn’t help it,because the boss came back to life…
 If we stay here,we’re going to get killed.
 The only choice we haveis to run away!
 If you want to run away,then go.
 I’m not running away.
 I’m not going to give up,I will save this child.
 I will feed this boythe curry of life!
 Grandma…
 It’s the curry that revived Lee.
 Yes.
 If anything happens,it’s not my fault!
 You!
 One, two…
 One, two…
 One, two… One, two…
 One, two… One, two…
 This is bad…
 This is really bad!
 Eat this…you’ll feel better.
 Please.
 You messed up onmixing the spices.
 Oh my?!
 Karashi, could you have memorizedmy recipe of the curry of life?
 Karashi…
 This is the true curry of life.
 Here, please eat this.
 You can’t even eatif you’re not with Raiga?
 Why…?
 Why…for a person like me?
 Does one need a reasonto save someone?
 To save you,
 Grandma Sansho and Karashidid their best to make the curry.
 Don’t you feel anything seeingthose two trying their best?
 If you don’t feel anything,you’re a horrible human being!
 Human beings support each otherin order to live…
 If there are people who need help,don’t others naturally lend them a hand?
 Isn’t that being human?
 Anyway, one bite is fine.Why don’t you try it?
 Was it good?
 That is what it feels like to live.
 Raiga …
 I want him to eat this curry too.
 Let’s go.
 I’m far from finished…!
 This guy…What is up with him?
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Damn it! What in the worldhappened to my body?!
 It is pitch black in front of me,my entire body is numb,
 and my body doesn’t dowhat I want it to do.
 What is this feeling…?
 It’s warm, my entire bodyis burning,
 and what is this taste that brings energyup from the bottom of my stomach…?

196,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 So it’s a case of not being able to fightwith the leader
 unless I defeat the underlings?
 Well then!
 Hot-Blooded Confrontation:Student vs. Sensei
 So you think you’ve blackened the pathto this Might Guy’s tomorrow with this?
 Youth is breaking throughthe walls that close you in…
 If you have both passion and effort, then nothing is impossible!
 With our sights trained on tomorrow…!
 Is there no tomorrow for us…?
 So this wood retainsits incredible strength
 because it is reinforced andconnected by Chakra, I see.
 Guy Sensei…
 Yagura?
 Are you all right?!
 I’m not Yagura…
 Eldest of the three Ryudouin brothers, Gensho!
 Second son of the same, Rokkaku!
 Third son, Jako!
 Ryudouin?
 Hmm… I think I’ve heardof that somewhere…
 Don’t tell me that you don’t remember!
 Our father, Agira Ryudouin,was deeply injured
 by the cowardly strategies of youHidden Leaf Shinobi.
 And unable to execute his missions,he passed away in despair.
 Our father resented you to the very end,
 even muttering your nameon his deathbed…
 telling us to fight withMight Guy of Hidden Leaf Village.
 From that day forth,
 our objectivehas been to avenge his death!
 Yes! We have been lying in wait forthe time when we could get even with you!
 Oh! Do you mean that Agira?!
 There’s no way I could forget that battle.
 Although we were enemieson our missions, Agira was a fine man…
 That will remain in my memory asa splendid contest, even within
 the annals ofthe complete eight-volume
 “Might Guy’s History of Famous Battles.”
 It was a man-to-man fight.
 Nothing happened that dishonoredmy Way of Ninja!
 You three must be mistaken.
 I won’t be angry at you,so let me out of here!
 Fool! I shall wreak vengeance upon you to settle my father’s score…
 I’ll finish you off!
 Sakura…
 I noticed you were there some time ago.
 My master told me tomake sure you don’t overdo it.
 You’re hiding something, aren’t you?!
 N-No… Nothing!
 Sakura, you’re not very good at lying…
 What?
 Die, Might Guy!Enemy of our father!
 Wait, I tell you!
 Hey, you Yagura imposter.lnfiltrating Village Hidden in the Leaves,
 what are you scheming?!
 Byakugan!
 Guy is in that building!The building is controlled by their Chakra!
 Why you--!
 Intense Brow Sensei,I’m coming to your rescue!
 Wh-What is this?!
 Do you intend to shut us inwith these pieces of wood?
 Don’t underestimate us!
 Stop it, Naruto!
 Wooden Dummies for training?
 Are these also controlled by those three?
 However strong they are,
 they couldn’t move all ofthese Wooden Dummies at once.
 It’s hard to believe those three wouldhave that much power.
 Byakugan!
 I see.
 They have a simple mechanism,
 and their movements are controlled bythe labels stuck to the back of their heads.
 So, they’re not moved with Puppet Jutsu?
 No, they’re only designed forrepeated punches and kicks,
 so they probably cannot respondto our movements!
 Does this mean their movementscan be halted by removing the labels?
 So that’s what it’s all about!
 If that’s the case,then I’ll return that blow!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Here goes!
 Once I know the weak spot,you’re all mine!
 – Gotcha! 					– Gotcha!
 Hah! This is easy!
 These Wooden Dummies arejust one small part of our Jutsu!
 Ninja Art:Wooden Dummy Manipulation Jutsu!
 Damn you!
 Keep your wits about you!
 There’s one that moves differently from the others!
 Neji!
 U-zu-ma-ki…
 Naruto Barra--!
 Stay back!
 Some of these Wooden Dummies seemto be manipulated by the Puppet Jutsu.
 Be careful!
 – Lee! 					– Bushy Brow!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Lee?!
 How did you know we were here?!
 From what Sakura told us,
 I felt certain that Guy Senseiwould take this route
 if he were headed forthe Land of Mountain Streams.
 And where is Guy Sensei?
 Inside there.
 What?
 A-Are they running away?
 What’s happening?!
 It’s just like a castle!
 Leave this to me!
 Guy Sensei is my master!I would risk my life to save him!
 But, Bushy Brow,your leg injury hasn’t healed yet.
 I’m going in!
 It’s reckless!
 Do you intend to interfere?
 Today, I am justa bit different from usual--!
 Bushy Brow, we’ll cover you.
 There is a weak point inthe Chakra at the center of the castle.
 If you hit there, then…
 But it may be a trap!
 Everyone… If it is a trap, let’s try falling into it intentionally.
 Over there!
 Dynamic Entry!
 As we suspected,it was a trap to lure me in.
 Anyway, let’s follow it through.
 Rokkaku, Jako, leave the rest to me.
 All right.
 Take revenge on that cowardby a suitable method.
 Leave it to me…
 Wooden Dummy: Possess:Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!
 A Wooden Dummy here too?
 Your teacher is an incredible liar, Lee…
 Is that Yagura’s voice I hear?
 I’ll teach you both,master and student,
 that sometimes passion andeffort alone come to naught.
 I won’t allow you tospeak ill of my teacher.
 If you’ve got something to say,
 then why don’t you come out hereand say it?
 There is no need.
 I can amply prove it with the Wooden Dummy that is my incarnation.
 I have come to rescue my teacher!
 There’s no wayI’m going to let myself lose to you!
 You make me laugh…
 What’s this? The Leaf Hurricane…?
 Does this mean that the technique I deployed that time
 has been completely imitatedand mastered by Yagura?!
 In that case…
 Leaf's Severe Hurricane!
 Can this really be Yagura?
 If he’s mastered notonly offensive moves,
 but also learned to guard withsuch perfection
 then he truly must be a genius!
 What an incrediblypowerful spinning kick…
 The Gensho I faced off within the practice hall
 did not have this much power.
 To my knowledge,
 there is only one person whocould let loose this powerful a kick.
 They are student and teacherwho respect each other.
 Dying in fighting each other must be a wish come true.
 We’ll have them crush each other
 with Wooden Dummies mimickingeach other’s movements.
 Even if each were to discoverthe true identity of his opponent…
 They can’t escape from the confrontation
 without defeatingthe Wooden Dummies before their eyes.
 That is the secret of
 Wooden Dummy: Possess:Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!
 Looks like my legscan’t last for very long…
 If it comes to this,there’s only one move left.
 Guy Sensei, it’s okay right?
 If I use it for your sake,you’ll probably forgive me.
 The Lotus?
 Could it be that the one who is controlling this Wooden Dummy is Lee?
 Dancing Leaf Shadow!
 A combo move from the Lotus Hit Backto aerial Severe Leaf Hurricanes!
 It’s magnificent…Too magnificent!
 Only Guy Sensei could usesuch artful techniques!
 Splendid! If I had not been his opponent,
 I’m 100% certain that he would havetoppled the opponent with that Lotus.
 But, at this rate, I won’t be able to beat this Jutsu…
 Wait! There is a way.
 That tapping is Morse Code.“You and I are destroying each other…”
 But there’s no way for eitherof us to end this fight
 without defeating the enemy’s Jutsu…
 So, it was Guy Sensei that I was fighting all along?
 We must both create an attack with speed and power
 of a magnitude that cannot be reproduced by the Wooden Dummies…
 “But I cannot show to you the abyss of death again!”
 Master Guy, if I do it to protect the person who is most important to me…
 “You will forgive me for using that move, won’t you?
 ""To me…"" 					""To me…""
 “To me, there is no one more importantthan Guy Sensei,” you say?
 Lee! What do you mean bymaking me cry at a time like this?
 Lee! I haven’t forgotten the promiseI made to you back then!
 “If you die…I shall die with you.”
 Thank you, Guy Sensei!
 Now is the very time when…
 one’s own Way of Ninja…
 – must be followed to the very end! – must be followed to the very end!
 Third Gate: Gate of Life… Open!
 Fourth Gate: Gate of Pain… Open!
 Guy Sensei!
 We’re far from finished!
 What’s wrong, Elder Brother?
 They’re fast. They’re both too fast…
 At this rate,the Wooden Dummies will…break.
 Fifth Gate: Gate of Closing!
 Open!
 I can’t see them.They’re faster even than sound!
 There you go, Lee!
 Bring the Chakra of your passions to bear upon your opponent!
 Right!
 – The castle is…– …crumbling?
 If this was revenge,
 then why did you not come at mewith the Kung Fu techniques of Ryudoin?
 That day, though he wasthe only man left,
 your father refused to surrender,
 but fairly and sportingly confronted mewith Kung Fu.
 Out of respect to your father,I faced him one to one.
 When the fight was finished,your father smiled slightly,
 as if satisfied, and said he would liketo fight again…
 Whether or not you believe me,this is all there was to it.
 Could it be thatwhat Father wanted to say
 was not that he wanted usto defeat Master Guy,
 but that he wanted to fight again,fairly and squarely?
 Have we had the wrong idea all along?
 I learned something important fromyour father in that fight.
 It is not the people born with natural gifts who are the lucky ones;
 the truly fortunate are they who, believing in themselves to the very end,
 can go on striving and keep the flameof their passions alive because of it.
 Uh-huh.That’s a good teacher-student relationship.
 Naruto!
 Say, Sakura! Hurry up and getBushy Brow to Grandma’s place, will you?
 Got it! Get him to the stretcher.
 No, don’t worry about me.I’m okay. See to Yagura first.
 Speaking of which,I still haven’t asked of Yagura’s real name.
 Lee, there’ll be plenty of tim for that later.
 Administering first-aidshould take priority.
 Yes! Guy Sensei!
 Yup, yup… That is really onesuper teacher-student relationship.
 I wish mine was as good…

 A Battle of Bugs!              The Deceivers and the Deceived!
 What the heck is happening…?
 Why does Hinata haveto be kidnapped?!
 Why are there guys who knowthat we’re searching for Bikochu?!
 We were being watched all this time.Ever since we arrived…
 You were aware of that?!
 You’re the only one who didn’t know.
 Why didn’t you tell me?!
 Because if we told you,you’d have raised a big fuss!
 And the insects would flee!All the insects…!
 Including the Bikochu!
 If they tried to steal the Bikochufrom us through force,
 the insects would be in dangerof getting hurt.
 So they captured Hinata anddecided to go with a hostage exchange.
 That’s very smart of them.
 Something smells sweet…
 It’s the smell of honey.
 Bee’s honey…
 Bees…?
 Hinata’s scent ends here…
 In that case…
 Those guys waited for a moment whenHinata was alone
 and attacked her using bees.
 I’ve heard that in the Hidden Stone Villagein the Land of Earth,
 there’s a clan of insect handlerswho primarily use bees.
 The name of that clan is…the Kamizuru Clan.
 Kamizuru…? That’s a namethat isn’t heard very often.
 Seems they were once hailed as beingat a level equal to the Aburame Clan…
 But they aren’t anymore?
 This is a story fromthe times of my grandfather…
 There was a time when the Shinobiof the Hidden Stone Village
 were going to invade the Leaf Village…
 The Kamizuru Clan was designatedto spearhead the operation…
 The plan was to createa disruption by releasing
 a large swarm of bees into the villagefollowed by an invading main unit…
 However, the Aburame Clanwised up to that
 and prepared to engage the enemyin the forest to the west!
 This battle between insect handlerswhich had no precedent in history…
 ended in the Aburame’s victory…
 With this battle as the turning point,
 the Aburame Clan rose tounchallenged status
 in the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 On the other hand, the Kamizuru Clanwas subjected to cold treatment
 even in their own village.
 I’ve heard that only a few of themremain now…
 So those people came hereto capture Bikochu, huh?
 What the heck are those guysplanning to do with the Bikochu?
 If my insects come backwe might be able to learn something…
 I see… I've been captured…
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves isin a difficult situation right now…
 Because of that incidentat the recent Chunin exam?
 The Hokage was assassinated,and I hear they lost many Shinobi too.
 Times are about to change dramatically…
 This is a chance for us,the Kamizuru Clan,
 to distinguish ourselves.
 But to do that…
 The founder’s Book of Secrets, huh?
 A broad range of Forbidden Jutsufor Insect Handlers
 are apparently inscribed thereinamong other things…
 If we possessed that at the time ofthe battle with the Aburame Clan,
 we wouldn’t have lost…
 However, Clan members have continuedto search for it for many years,
 but couldn’t find it.
 Do you really thinkwe can find it after all this time?
 That’s why we need the Bikochu …
 I brought the keepsakesof the founder, my grandfather, with me…
 When the Bikochu emerges,it will pursue the scent it recognizes.
 And we should be ableto locate the Book of Secrets
 that Grandfather hid justas he was dying.
 This strand of his hairwill surely lead us to it.
 If we get our hands onthe Book of Secrets
 and if we engage in some big action…
 I am certain that… the people ofthe village will also acknowledge us.
 Those people are also desperatelyseeking recognition.
 Naruto…
 Did you find out anything?How about Hinata’s whereabouts?
 No… The other insects were probablyalso done in by those guys.
 Damn! Then our only choiceis to do what they want?
 When I went to all thattrouble of finding it…
 So you want to desert Hinata?
 H-How could anyone possibly do that?!
 I won’t desert her no matterwhat might happen!
 Anybody who deserts a comrade is trash!
 Exactly.
 But then we’d be able to locate Sasukeif we have this guy here…
 Well, I guess we’ll have to think ofsome other method of finding Sasuke.
 Yeah… Right now, the first thingwe need to do is rescue Hinata.
 But, do you think Hinatawould be satisfied with that?
 The person who originallythought up this plan was Hinata.
 Huh? But…
 It’s true that I told her aboutthe existence of Bikochu…
 However…
 The odds of findinga Bikochu are extremely low…
 We thought that she should aspireto an important mission
 with an assured outcome for the village,rather than a mission with such low odds.
 But Hinata didn’t give up.
 She argued persistently thatif there was even a small possibility,
 one should take on the challenge.
 Th-That Hinata did…?
 She was extremely forceful andShino and I had no choice but to agree.
 It’s the first time Hinataever volunteered for a mission.
 For that reason too,I want to make this a success.
 Yeah.
 But when we don’t knowwhere Hinata is, how are we…?
 There is one place where Hinatawill definitely make an appearance.
 I see! The place where…
 …the exchange withthe Bikochu takes place!
 We will definitely havea chance at that time.
 All right!We will recover Hinata without fail…
 and we will also protectthe Bikochu to the very end!
 We brought the Bikochu!Return Hinata!
 Place the insect cageon that rock over there!
 Hinata!
 Release Hinata!
 I must verify it first!
 What’s…the meaning of this?!
 Are you trying to make a mockeryof our Clan? Of insect handlers?!
 A goliath beetle…You gotta be kidding!
 Now, Shino!
 What?!
 Parasitic Insects!
 Heh! Recovery successful!
 All right!
 Damn!
 Naruto!
 All right, resign yourselves!
 Your time’s up!
 What’s this?
 This one doesn’t smell like Hinata!
 Huh?!
 Just as I thought…
 Beeswax…?
 There they come!
 Damn! You jerk! You jerk!
 Damn! All these things are honey…?!
 Sorry, Naruto…But these damn bees!
 There’s no end to them!
 Do we need to slash themif they’re honey?!
 You two don’t move from there!
 Huh?
 This is the genuine thing!And furthermore, it contains deadly poison.
 It appears that genuine onesare mixed in…
 But they’re indistinguishablefrom each other!
 Back me up for a little!
 Wall of Insects Jutsu!
 A-Awesome…
 Amazing power for a Genin…
 As might be expected fromthe Aburame Clan…I guess.
 The Kamizuru Clan…
 Huh…? So you were awareof that fact.
 Return Hinata!
 Of course, our intention wasto return her…
 But only if you calmly hand overthe Bikochu.
 However…
 It looks like you haveno intention of doing that!
 In that case,what do you plan on doing?
 If you’re an insect handler,
 you wouldn’t bring a delicate insectlike the Bikochu
 to a dangerous placelike a battleground…
 We’ll finish you off right here…
 and take our time afterwardsto search for the Bikochu!
 Wall of Insects Jutsu!
 That one doesn’t haveany other tricks, huh!
 Shino! Paper Bombs!
 Take this!
 1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!
 Insect Clones…?
 Up to your annoying tricks, huh…
 Shino! What are we gonna do now?!
 Don’t you think we shouldgo back there for a moment?
 Those guysmight find the Bikochu!
 No…that location will definitely be safe.
 More importantly, the first thingwe need to do is search for Hinata!
 There’s no mistake.
 Inside here.
 Hinata! Where are you?!
 Hey! Be careful!
 There’s no sign of those guys,but it might be a trap…
 Is she there?!
 Hinata…?
 Hinata!
 Are you all right, Hinata?
 I’ll rescue you in a moment!
 Just a little more!
 All right… I got it off!
 Naruto…
 Thank you!
 H-Hinata…?!
 H-Hinata…stop that!
 What do you think you’re doing,out of the blue like that?!
 Who…are you?
 What are you talking about, Shino?That’s Hinata.
 If you’re really Hinata,
 you’d get red in the faceand faint if you hugged Naruto.
 – Huh? 					– Oh!
 I see… But Akamaru’s nose wouldn’t fail…
 What? The smell of two peopleis mingled?
 You’re not Hinata?
 Naruto… It’s me…I’m Hinata, believe me.
 In that case…
 show us what you tried to stickon Naruto’s back right now!
 A Paper Bomb?
 So you were intendingto blow up Naruto!
 I thought that would work…
 You are…
 I see, the one on the hillwas a clone, huh…
 Wearing Hinata’s clothes…
 That’s how she was ableto compromise the smell.
 Where is the real Hinata?!
 I wonder where she could be?
 I see…
 Suzumebachi luredthe Aburame Clan, huh?
 Well, it appears that your comrades…
 place more value on the Bikochuthan on you.
 There’s nobody else comingto rescue you.
 Jibachi, Let’s search forthe Bikochu that those guys hid!
 There’s not much time until sunrise!
 Right!
 Don’t even try to escape.
 If you make even the smallest movementout of the ordinary,
 those bees will cut the string.
 Up ahead is the entrance toa labyrinthine underground water vein…
 If you fall in, you’ll pass intothe other world in an instant.
 We don’t wish to killanyone unnecessarily.
 If you want to live,I suggest you just stay quiet.
 How mortifying… I ended up beinga burden to everyone, after all.
 You guys are just like summer insectswho fly right into the fire!
 If you’re lucky, we’ll meet again…
 That place isn’t just an ordinary cave.
 Hey! Let go! Shino! Naruto!
 There’s nothing else to grab on to.
 Be patient until I’ve checkedthe surroundings!
 No!
 A huge number of bee larvae!
 Bee larvae, huh…?
 But what’s with their unusual huge size?
 If you tell me where you hid the Bikochu,I’ll spare your life.
 I refuse!
 Searching for the Bikochu isthe mission that we were given!
 Then die!
 Paper Bombs!
 Damn! Let’s go, Akamaru!
 Fang Over Fang!
 That sound is…
 I see… They’re still continuing to fightwithout giving up.
 This is not the time to be crying…
 There’s no way that I can give up.I suggested this whole thing!
 Byakugan!
 There are 13 bees…attached to the string.
 If I can take them all down at once…I’ll be saved.
 But, to take down bees that small…
 Impossible! This guy…
 I told you before…I don't know…when to give up.
 Naruto…
 Yes… I won’t give up either!
 I need to concentrate andcontrol my Chakra…
 Fang Over Fang!
 How many of them are there…?!
 Kiba!
 I-I can’t muster any strength…Somehow my body is…
 No way!
 The larvae in this hive’s favorite foodis Chakra!
 What?!
 As long as you’re in there,
 they’ll go through the wallto suck up the Chakra…
 What’s the matter…?
 So have you decidedto tell me the location?
 Now!
 Four…
 Five, six…ten…
 Eleven, twelve, thirteen…
 Damn!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Would you like to be the feedfor the larvae…
 or would you like to get out of hereand become the prey of this girl here?
 Choose whichever you like!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What should I do? My body won’t move.
 I proposed this mission myselfwanting to help Naruto, and yet…
 I don’t want to end up asa burden to everyone anymore,
 that’s what I aimed for, but …
 No, calm down.
 I need to concentrate my Chakraand remember that training!
 I have no choice but to do it now!That is the best I can do right now!

 His music is a Ninjutsu?
 Yeah! Awesome Chakra started burstingthroughout my body.
 My power goes up like crazy!
 That’s a rare Jutsu, isn’t it?
 Shizune, have we identified the onewho attacked the villagers?
 No, not yet…
 Menma. I’ve once heard ofa Jutsu similar to yours.
 – What?!– Is that true, Grandma?!
 I seem to recall thatthe Land of Rice Paddies has a Jutsu
 that use musical instruments asthe catalysts.
 Land of Rice Paddies?You mean that Land of Rice Paddies?
 Come to think of it,
 the upper part of the mountain streamwhere Naruto found Menma was…
 Land of Rice Paddies?
 Please allow me to go there!
 But infiltrating another landwithout cause is…
 No, we do have cause!
 There might be hints thereabout Menma’s lost memory.
 I’d also like to make that request.
 Very well.
 Excellent, Grandma!Now you’re talking!
 Thank you.
 Bringing Back Reality
 And so we’ll be heading out for a bit.
 Right, got it.
 The special pickled bamboo shootsshould be ready
 by the time you guys get back.
 I can’t wait. Bye!
 Really, there’s no real needfor you guys to come.
 We have no choice. It’s a mission.
 Our mission is to accompany you guys!
 Now that it’s settled…
 Let’s get to the Land of Rice Paddies!
 Right.
 – Naruto. 					– Huh?
 You stay here.
 Huh?
 What do you want, Grandma?
 If you’re any kind of sorry excusefor a Shinobi, you should know.
 What?
 I’m talking about Menma.lf that kid is a…
 No way is he a bad guy.
 I know he’s not a bad person.
 But can you state flatly thathe’s not an enemy spy?
 What’re you driving at, Grandma?!
 You couldn’t have forgotten.
 The Village Hidden in Soundin the Land of Rice Paddies
 is the place where Orochimaruonce hid himself.
 Well, I…
 I…remember that, but…
 Menma’s Jutsu is strikingly similar to thatof the opponent Shikamaru fought
 when Sasuke was taken away.
 There’s no denying there’s a chance
 he’s affiliated withthe Hidden Sound Village.
 And if he remembers something andthat was to become a threat to this land…
 No way could Menma be an enemy…That just can’t be!
 We’ll leave you behind if you dawdle!
 Naruto, I’m going on ahead!
 Are you hurt?
 No… Thanks for the help.
 You were going a bit too fast.
 Let’s take a break.
 What the heck’s wrong?!
 Who in the world is he?
 We’re going to investigatebecause we don’t know that.
 I was running at full speed earlier.
 Losing my footing on the branchafter that was on purpose, though…
 What?
 Not only did he keep up with my speed,
 but he even showedthe composure to save me.
 He is better than us in terms of speed.
 He’d be a troublesome opponentif we end up fighting.
 Wha--?Hey, hey, wait a minute.
 He’s not an enemy!
 He risks his life to rescue babies.
 And he’s the kind of guy who,if left on his own,
 would help those in trouble all day!
 That’s a nice sound.
 I still hadn’t thanked youfor fixing this for me.
 Don’t worry about it.
 Hey!
 Stop playing that right now!
 If you don’t…
 Neji. What’s the big idea?!
 You keep quiet!
 What?!
 It’s as Neji says.
 That might’ve beena signal to an enemy!
 A signal?
 Lady Tsunade approved this missionbecause the suspicious person
 who entered the village the other daystill hasn’t been caught!
 If that intruder has followed Menma…
 he should be close to us now.
 No way…
 As of this point, he hasn’t shownhis presence, though.
 Our mission is to accompany Naruto,
 verify his identity andto capture the intruder!
 Sorry, but I don’t trust you!
 That’s right…lt’s natural I’d be thought of like that…
 I think about thisfrom time to time…
 What kind of a person was I?
 What would I do if I werea bad person…?
 Naruto, what kind of person wouldyou want to be if you were reborn?
 Wh-What’s this all of a sudden?
 I’m speaking figuratively…
 I’ve never thought about it.
 I see…
 But why do you asksomething like that?
 Oh, no special reason…
 What is it?
 What’s this smell?
 Now that you mention it,it smells like something’s burning.
 Over there.
 Let’s go.
 The smell came from here…
 Was there a fire or something…?
 Is something wrong?
 No…
 It’s nothing.
 Don’t move. I’ll fire if you move.
 What’s the deal all of a sudden?
 Are you their minions?
 “Their”?
 You’ll die here ifyou’re comrades of theirs.
 For crying out loud, who are they?!
 If you say you’re not,then show me some proof!
 Proof, why? We’re Leaf Shinobi.
 Hidden Leaf Village?
 See? Look at this.
 Indeed that is…
 What do Leaf Shinobi wantin a place like this?
 Well, we just happenedto be passing through and…
 As you can see, there’s nothing here.
 If you don’t have business here,just beat it.
 If you don’t,we can’t guarantee your life.
 What’s with him talking all big?!
 Here, he was the onewho picked the fight.
 Once we’ve had our breather,
 let’s blow this joint and go lookfor Menma’s memory.
 R-Right…
 What? Did you remember something?
 No…
 Who’s there? Come on out.
 Hello.
 Y-You guys are Ninja, right?
 I heard what you were talkingabout earlier…
 Oh, well, I don’t want to brag, but…
 If you’re talking about Naruto Uzumakifrom Hidden Leaf Village,
 I’m pretty well known.
 Really? I’m sorry, I didn’t know.
 Why did you go to the troubleof following us?
 Umm… I had a favor to ask…
 My older brother saidwhat he did earlier, but…
 Older brother?!
 That jerk from earlier?
 We need someone to save our village!
 A person to save your village…?
 What do you mean?
 This was the border ofthe Land of Rice Paddies.
 But…
 as our land had caused troublefor other lands,
 this area was turned intoa demilitarized zone.
 Are you talking aboutthat thing in question…?
 It must be the incidentinvolving Orochimaru.
 That’s how things were settledwith all the neighboring lands, huh?
 But if it’s a demilitarized zone,there won’t be any territorial dispute, right?
 That’s right.
 It’s not like that.
 There’s a small minein the hills behind the village
 and a little bit of gold can be dug up.
 Once it was discovered that mine is notbeing supervised by a proprietary land,
 bandits started coming withtheir eyes on the gold…
 No matter how often we askedthe feudal lord,
 he would insist that, “Agreements betweenfellow lands must not be broken.”
 And the village…
 It was attacked by bandits, right?
 They withdrew in the middle of itdue to a terrible storm before.
 But they’ll definitely be back.
 I beg you. Please save our village.
 You guys could fight them!
 All right! Got it…
 I’m sorry.
 We can understand the situation,but we can’t cooperate.
 Huh? What’re you saying, Neji?!
 We’re in the middle of a mission!
 We can’t act unlesswe have an official order from the village!
 But…
 Besides, we don’t knowwhen the bandits will be back.
 We can’t just strandourselves here forever!
 Damn it…
 I see…
 What’re you doing Ran,even bringing Fuki here?
 Big Brother…
 Don’t get involved with them.There’s no such thing as a good Ninja.
 Say what?!
 I just stated the truth.
 The rumor has it that the guys whoattacked the village were Rogue Shinobi
 from the Hidden Sound Village.
 Huh? The bandits are Ninja?
 Come this way.
 Look at that.
 Wh-What’s this?!
 One-third of the villagers were killedin the attack the other day.
 Half of the rest abandonedthe village and fled.
 Then you guys should also evacuate…
 Where are we supposed to flee?!
 This is ancestral landthat’s been handed down to us
 and that we’ve cultivated.
 Why should we have to flee from that?!
 Each time the hooligansbrandish their power,
 we have to accept it likea natural disaster and do nothing?!
 Are we to just flee from place to place?!
 Don’t shout, Big Brother.
 Fuki will get scared.
 I’m sorry I shouted…
 Her parents were killed by banditsand she lost her ability to speak.
 There’s no place for us to escape.
 If that’s clear, then beat it already.
 We have no choice.Let’s hurry on ahead.
 I’m staying here.
 Huh?
 I want to be of use ifthose people are in trouble.
 Menma!
 Hey, you don’t even knowthe scale of the bandits.
 If you want to help them,no matter what,
 then we should go backto the village and…
 We don’t know when they might attack.
 We don’t have the timeto return to the village!
 Then, I’m staying, too!
 Naruto! Anything further than thisis beyond the scope of the mission!
 This isn’t beyond the scopeof the mission!
 I get the feeling I’ll be able toremember something if I stay here.
 Don’t say irresponsible things!
 You couldn’t remember anythingjust a moment ago…
 That’s too convenient!
 It can’t be helped, right?Menma himself is saying so.
 He’s good-natured to a fault!
 Naruto…
 Let’s go, Menma.
 Right.
 Hey, Naruto!
 We’ll deal with the bandits.
 You guys go on backto the village ahead.
 What do we do, Neji?!
 Leave them be.
 It’s unlikely the villagers willaccept Naruto and Menma.
 You’ve got a point…
 It seems the settlement on the other sidehas escaped damage, huh?
 But how’re we supposed to protectthe village just the two of us…?
 Let’s build a wall along this creek.This river will play the role of a moat.
 Ultimately we’ll make a temporary bridge
 and have the entrance to the villagein just one location.
 I get it…
 I don’t know how effective it’ll be,
 but let’s just do the bestwe can now.
 Right.
 What’re you doing? I told you to get out.
 We won’t get out!
 What did you say?!
 We decided to protectthe village on our own.
 Nobody asked you to do that.lt’s none of your business!
 You may say that,
 but you can’t beat them offby just hiding in your houses!
 All right, let’s stabilize it with a stake.
 Got it…
 Jeez, what can they dojust the two of them?!
 I’m ready…
 Okay.
 Tenten! You’re still here?!
 Can’t you at least say thanks first?
 Thanks, Tenten.
 Come on, Naruto. Hold it down right.
 R-Right…
 You are…
 For me?
 Then I’ll help myself.
 Have this, too.
 I’ll help out, too.
 You’re mine!
 Not yet!
 That technique!
 It’s from that time!
 Neji! You…
 It’s our mission this time aroundto catch this guy.
 Heh! This guy’s formidable.
 Damn it!
 He’s quick to escape!
 Naruto!
 The sound waves pierced my wholeChakra Network all at once
 and amplified the flow of Chakra?
 I won’t lose to the likes of this guyif I have this Jutsu!
 This is to avenge everyone.
 Eat this!
 You’re in my way!
 Menma!
 Menma! Menma!
 Carry him to the village.
 Manma! Hang in there!
 Boiling water and alcohol!
 All right.
 Are you going to treat him?
 I may not look it,but I’ve played at being a doctor.
 We’ll save you now, Menma.
 What’s the matter?
 I cannot treat this guy…
 Wh-Why not?!
 This mark…
 He’s a comrade of a guywho attacked here…!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Menma is not a member of the bandits.
 I mean, he loves helping people!
 He’s a type of guy who would even riskhis own life in order to save a kid!
 For this village too,
 he has worked hard, so hard,even though no one really asked for it.
 He’s got to have some kind of reason.
 So please save Menma!

 Cut it out already!
 Keep this up and you’ll really turninto the Demon of the Ocean!
 Do it, Isaribi.
 Your opponent is right here.
 You said that Orochimaru left
 that research facilityhalf a month ago…
 Where did he go?
 I don’t know…
 Now that you mention it,Orochimaru had a kid in tow.
 I heard that the kid isreally excellent, unlike you.
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 Something about youjust wasn’t enough.
 That’s why you were abandoned,I guess.
 Isarirbi?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Isaribi…
 I bet you still understandwhat I’ve been saying to you, Isaribi!
 Don’t you care a bit aftertormenting everyone this much?
 No.
 I think nothing of…even bringing you down…
 That’s a lie!
 It doesn’t matter to mewho gets injured…
 or who drowns…

 It’s about time to cometo yourself!
 I understand painfullyenough how you feel…
 But…doing that…lt’s not good!
 Isaribi, you saved me.You have a kind heart!
 Pretty good for a Medical Ninja.
 Shut up!
 I’m a little surprised that
 you had enough timeto take your eyes off…
 D-Damn it!
 You’re too confident…
 You’re useless.
 How long you thinkyou’ll be doing this?
 Amachi…
 He’s just a kid.
 Why can’t you finish him offright away?
 Sorry. But…
 I can’t take it anymore.Get out of my way!
 Bring it on.I’ll kill a damn monster like you!
 Monster? Me?
 That’s right!
 You so easily injureand kill people.

 Water Style:Great Cannonball Jutsu!
 What’s wrong,you’re done already?
 Give it up already, kid!
 I told you!
 Until I take Isaribi back…
 I absolutely will not…quit!
 Why…
 would you go thatfar to save me?
 I can’t keep up with the farce.
 Come on! Sea Monster!
 Do it…Sea Monster!
 Hey! Let go of me, you!
 Let me tell you that almost all ofSea Monster’s body is made of water.
 You can say it's likea moving Water Prison Jutsu.
 Naruto!
 Damn…
 You’re stupid.
 Do you think somethinglike that will affect it at all?
 Do you understand, Isaribi?
 I am the only onewho can save you.
 Now, finish them off!
 What’s wrong?
 You want to turn back intoa human, don’t you?
 Then do as I say!
 It’s no good…
 It’s no good…
 I can’t let Isaribi…go to…that world…
 This feeling…
 SEAL
 What?! What are theseextraordinary Chakras?
 S-Sea Monster!
 Isaribi…
 I will never let Isaribigo over there!
 What are you…?!
 Naruto…?!
 He’s the same as you.
 Same as me…?!
 Yes…
 The Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,who long ago attacked our village,
 is sealed inside Naruto.
 And there was a time
 when everyone in the villagetreated him like a monster.
 And…
 And even so, he works so hard,everybody approves of him.
 I understand painfully enoughhow you feel…
 But…doing that…lt's not good.
 Those words…were true…
 Naruto!
 You bastard!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Oh, I was able to dothe Chief Toad summoning
 for the first time in a while!
 Now, prepare yourself,you flabby jerk!
 Tomorrow will never comefor you again!
 This itches!
 What? It’s not a good timeto be getting scared now!
 It really itches.
 Now, Chief Toad,take him out good.
 Naruto, summoning me insalt water like this!
 I could take your life for this!
 What…?!

198,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 Like I said, I've already told youeverything I know.
 You first met Genno at Ichiraku…
 What did you talk about then?
 I don’t remember everything!
 That’s what we want to know.
 If we analyze your conversation,
 we might be able to figure outwho hired Genno.
 We already know allthe conversations
 that you've had duringthe past two weeks.
 What we want to know is whatyou guys talked about before that.
 You tell me that but…I don’t remember…
 Then we’ll put youunder Regressive Hypnosis.
 Huh? Regressive Hypnosis?
 Using hypnosis,
 we can bring out the memory ofthe past from your subconscious…
 Oh…
 Just relax…
 Back to the Past Jutsu!
 Let’s start…
 Right now you are travelingthrough your memories…
 A day ago… two days ago…three days ago…
 Keep going back into the past.
 And…it’s the day you metthe old carpenter.
 Where are you?
 Inside…the forest…
 The Anbu Gives Up?                                 Naruto's Recollection		I was training on my own…		And it was lunch time so…
 I headed for Ichiraku…
 And that’s where…
 You met him not insidethe restaurant, but outside, yes?
 Hey, what are you doing?
 Huh? Oh yes…
 I was just trying to figure out ifI should go into the restaurant or not.
 Is it any good?
 Old man, you’re not from here are you?
 Oh… I’m a freelance carpenter.How did you know?
 Because all the Leaf Village peopleknow that Ichiraku’s ramen is the best!
 I see…
 Here you go!Thanks for waiting!
 Yes! This is quite good!
 Isn’t it?!
 Thank you for this meal!
 You’re already done?
 I am a growing boy!
 Even an extra large isn’tenough for me!
 I see… Then, why don’t I giveyou some of mine.
 What? Are you sure?
 Yes.
 Lucky!
 Thanks…old man!
 So…we said good-bye afterwe finished eating the ramen…
 And when did you meet him next?
 I met him in front of Ichiraku again…
 Byakugan!
 There’s nothing here either…
 I see…
 Byakugan!
 I see…
 It seems like there wereodor neutralizing components
 in last night’s smoke screen.
 He was quite prepared
 Then why did he get caught?
 Well, that’s because our Anbu Black Opsare really good, right…?
 He should have known
 that our Anbu Black Ops were excellentbefore he infiltrated us…
 He should have hadother escape routes ready.
 Now that you mention it,that sounds about right…
 But right now,there’s no way to find out.
 Dead men tell no tales, I see.
 Over here.
 What are you doing?
 We’re connecting the piecesof the corpse.
 Connecting the pieces…
 It was in a really awful shape.
 From what I hear,he had Paper Bombs all over his body…
 Would you like to wait outsideuntil we’re done?
 I-I suppose so…
 I’ll stay here!
 What?
 You’re quite impressive…
 Sakura.
 And he gave me eggs andbarbeque pork that time…
 He’s talking about Ramen again.
 Shh!
 Oh, I remember that time…!
 What happened?
 He showed…me a photograph.
 A photograph?
 A photograph of a guy thatlooked about my age.
 When I asked him whyhe was so nice to me…
 I have a grandson.
 He’s about the same age as you.
 So I can’t think of you as a stranger.
 I look forward to treasure hunting withmy grandson on my days off.
 Treasure hunting?
 Yeah…
 What, you’re already done eating?!
 Then I’ll give you some of mine.
 Thanks, old man!
 What happened to your hand?
 Oh… It’s a scar from a long time ago
 when I accidentally cut myselfwith a saw.
 Oh.
 And then he gave mehis ramen again…
 Genno has no relatives…
 Then his story abouthis grandson a lie?
 We started marking him the next day.
 I think any more inquiries are pointless.
 I guess he wouldn’t be careless enough
 to leak any information even to a Gennin.
 An emergency reportfrom Lady Tsunade!
 I see… There was nothing unusualabout any of the buildings.
 They were all builtaccording to their plans…
 There were no signs of any traps.
 So was it just camouflage for himto sneak in as a carpenter?
 It’s too soon to make a judgment on that.
 If he was just supposed tosteal the plans,
 there was no need for himto be a carpenter.
 By the way,what were you guys looking up?
 We got a list of places wherehe used to stop by
 from his carpenter buddies,
 and we’re looking throughall those places,
 but so far we haven’t found any clues.
 Oh, there’re a lot of restaurants…
 Yeah… Seems like he neverwent out besides to go eat.
 In the meantime, Hinata,you go see Ino and Sakura
 at the forensics center.
 Neji and Choji, you guys gohelp Kiba and Shino!
 Understood.
 Then, we should get going too…
 Shikamaru!
 Lady Tsunade is calling for you!
 The Fifth Hokage is?
 What?! The Village Hiddenin the Waterfalls?
 It seems that they’ve committedall their troops into battle position.
 They’re calling ita big practice run, however…
 Big practice run…?
 I don’t think I need to say more, but…
 It’s been used many times in the past.They get all of their troops together
 for the purpose of a big practice runand then invade another country…
 Furthermore, there is information thatGenno stayed in
 the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls
 before coming tothe Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 It wouldn’t be unusual if therewas some sort of connection.
 Most of the Ninja we've deployed
 have already been mobilizedto the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.
 Crossing the border will betaken as a sign of willful invasion.
 We will attack anyone that enters.
 Shikamaru, I want you tohead over to the border, too!
 I don’t think that there’sa need for us to go.
 Shikamaru?!
 What do you mean…?
 Naruto. 					Hey, Naruto!
 Huh?
 You’re getting in the way of my businessby standing there!
 Oh… Sorry.
 Now that I think about it,
 I’ve never seen the old man finishhis ramen…
 Could it be that he hated ramen?
 But then why did he come tolchiraku all the time?
 Tell us why.
 Ten Gennin and one Chunin…
 Our presence or absence won’tmake much of a difference
 to the overall situation.
 What is your point…?
 I don’t like it…
 Old Man Genno’s actions…
 After the investigation,I’ve figured it out…
 His everyday activities werequite impressive…
 His abilities as a carpenterwas average,
 he was quite plain, never stood out,and never made any big mistakes
 Nobody hated him,and nobody liked him.
 Even if he were to disappearall of a sudden,
 no one would think twiceabout it the next day…
 A very low-key profile.
 It’s an undercover techniquethat's so impressive
 that I’d want to put itin a Shinobi textbooks.
 A brilliant Shinobi like him being markedby the Anbu Black Ops so easily…
 Don't you think that's a bit strange…?
 That’s true…
 And when he was trying to get away…
 He was able to get away fromthe Anbu Black Ops,
 but they caught up to him.
 For a trap professional,it seems like such a lame end.
 On top of all that, the planshave completely disappeared.
 It doesn’t make any sense to me.
 And…?
 Everything is movingalong according to his plan.
 It couldn’t be…?
 His true identity being discovered,
 and dying in front ofthe Anbu Black Ops…
 What if all of that was his plan?
 And if he had predicted thatwe would all leave the village
 in taking precautions againstthe Village Hidden in the Waterfalls…
 We could be just dancing onthe palm of his hand.
 But if we look at all the informationwe have at this point,
 we need to be on alert forthe Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.
 That’s true, but…
 However…
 I don’t think the situation willchange much
 just by sending another ten Genninand one Chunin…
 I’ll have the Shikamaru squadcontinue to investigate Genno.
 Understood.
 Shikamaru! Choji!
 Sorry… I didn’t mean to make you wait.
 My head hurts…
 Hey. Why do we have tolook through these books?
 I don’t want to do it either.But this is the basis of investigation.
 But still… There’re so many numbers,my eyes are hurting.
 I’m sorry…I still can’t find it .
 I see…
 What?
 The old recommendation letterthat enabled them
 to figure out that Genno’srecommendation letter was a fake.
 Why do you have to look for that?
 Just a hunch…
 Did the people of this house just lose it?Or did he…
 In either case,
 he should have wanted to get rid of
 the recommendation letterthat he brought…
 Why would he just get rid ofthe old recommendation letter?
 This is where he took his own life…?
 It seems that they’ve alreadycollected the remains.
 It’s a job done by the Anbu Black Ops…
 They don’t leave anything behind.
 Everyone, come over here!
 Look, the tree is burned on both sides!
 The Paper Bombs exploded…
 There should be burned marks.
 The fact that it’s on both sidesis the problem!
 I see. If it were just a suicide bomb,
 it wouldn’t have left marks on both sides.
 There would have to beat least two explosions
 to leave this kind of burn marks.
 But according to the Anbu Black Ops,
 he exploded the Paper Bombsthat were wrapped around his body.
 But no one saw him at the momentof the explosion…
 There may be Anbu Black Ops,
 but they’d still need to dodgethe explosion.
 This one’s burned on both sides too…
 Same on this tree too.
 Probably…
 First, the Paper Bombs thatwere placed on
 the trees in the surrounding areawere blown up…
 Then there was a huge explosionin the center.
 If he had set off the explosionsclose to each other,
 then it’s possible to perceive itas one explosion!
 I see…
 But in order to do that,
 he would have needed to set upsome sort of trick before hand.
 Didn't Genno take his life
 after being cornered bythe Anbu Black Ops?
 What if they didn't catch up to him,
 but rather,he let them catch up to him?
 So you’re saying thathe was running away
 planning to let themcatch up to him here?!
 It’s not impossible…
 If that is the case…
 It’s possible that he couldhave laid other traps
 Could it be that…
 the fact he killed himself withthe Paper Bombs is also…
 It’s done.They said you could come in.
 Y-Yeah.
 It’s impossible.
 Didn’t the Anbu Black Ops make surewith their own eyes…?
 Yeah.
 There's no point in telling meto check out the body.
 I’m not a Medical Ninja.
 What should I checkand how should I do it…?
 Sakura…
 This man… He snuck in asa carpenter right?
 That’s right. Is there somethingthat bothers you?
 His hand… It’s too clean.
 My family owns a flower shop,remember?
 I’ve been helping outsince I was a kid…
 So if I look at a person’s hand,I can tell what kind of job they do…
 Carpenter’s hands are much more rough.
 And there’s no way that a trapprofessional’s hand would be so clean!
 Then…!
 May I?
 Byakugan!
 Just as I suspected…
 There’s no evidence that he's trainedhis Chakra Network.
 This man has never controlleda Chakra…
 What?
 The people from the medical groupwere talking over there.
 That they have some questionsabout this body…
 This person is not a Ninja!
 Reporting! The spearhead ofthe Village Hidden in the Waterfalls
 is about to reach the borders!
 They’re fast…What about our enforcement army?
 They are gathering currently,
 but they’re not in positionfor battle quite yet…
 What if they attack even beforewe’re in position for battle?
 In any case…Who would have thought
 that the Village Hidden inthe Waterfalls would…
 Nothing will come of that right now.
 Once the enemy crosses that river,
 we will see that as their intentto wage war on us,
 and we will start to attack!
 Yes!
 Academy?
 There were no plans for the Academy…
 Excuse me!Could you help me?
 Did you call?
 We saw that the Academy hadmade some payments last month…
 Last month?
 Oh this. We did somereparation work for the Academy.
 We don't have the plans for that.
 No, that’s not possible…
 That’s strange…Where did I put it?
 What’s going on?
 Above…?
 What’s the matter, Naruto?
 What’s going on?
 They should show themselves soon…
 Reporting! The Village Hiddenin the Waterfalls spearhead
 that was closing in on the bordershas started to retreat!
 What?!
 It seems like it really wasa practice run…
 Then where are the stolen plans?!
 Th-This is…
 This is Shikamaru’s…
 These are the plans?
 Yeah…
 It’s written in a complex codeso that it’s not easily deciphered.
 But…
 Why are the plans that were stolenby Genno appearing here?
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say,“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!!Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stagedoes bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feelin my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s fromthat coke I just drank?
 Students these days,sure lack civility.
 They usually do things likeeat potato chips, eat barbeque…
 – Read comics.– And eat box lunches.
 – Is eating all you talk about?– All that loafing?
 Well, I meanthe self study hours are for…
 – You know?– No, I don’t know.
 They devote themselves to trainingeven though their Sensei is not watching.
 – Isn’t it beautiful?– Really?
 I am moved! I will back uptheir training myself!
 Huh?!

 Pretty impressive…
 You timed it well to scatterthe three to attack.
 You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?
 Since it is a pretty complicated song…
 Well…
 Not only did youimmediately understand
 that I’m manipulatingthese guys with my flute
 but you understoodhow difficult this song is.
 You’re a pretty impressive punk.
 But you can’t completelyunderstand this song.
 True… Since art is so foreign to me.
 But since she uses that fluteto manipulate,
 it means that song must containindividually specific sound patterns
 to control each and every movementof those guys…
 I’m pretty confident when it comesto just analyzing,
 but this time it’s not looking good.
 The reason is…
 I don’t understandmusical notes whatsoever.
 Fakeout: Shikamaru's Comeback!
 I’ll specially show youthe Camellia Dance next.
 I’ll crush you!
 You shouldn’t say thingsyou can’t even do.
 Shut up!
 What?!
 I told you.
 This bone is harder than steel.
 You should have a taste of itwith your own body.
 Damn!
 There’s no one that’s heardthis song and lived.
 Finale, Ninth Passage,Demon Revolution!
 The melody’s changed!
 Something’s gonna come!
 What the--?!
 What?
 This is…?
 The speed at which he fleesafter determining
 that these Material Ghostsare dangerous…
 Pretty impressive.
 But…
 I’ve used my precious Paper Bombsand Smoke Bombs all at once
 and all I could do was hide.
 That white one…
 bit off my physical energy.
 Seeing that shuriken passed through,
 that thing is semi-materialisticwith very little mass.
 It's Chakra itself with an appetite.
 It’s probably Chakra that’s shapedmostly by mental energy.
 That’s why it seeks stabilityand craves for physical energy.
 If I continue dealing withthose “Hungry Chakra”
 I won’t be able to build up my Chakra.
 They’re pretty dangerous.
 She’s a Shinobi who canmake special Chakra like me…
 It’s without a doubt, a Secret Ninjutsu.
 Which means I should leavethe white thing alone
 and aim for the main body!
 The quickest way would beto stop the sound of the flute, but…
 it’d be impossible to get close tothat woman in this situation.
 The next thing would be to capturethose three with Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 But that's difficult too since they’reattacking me separately at different times.
 If I let even one escapeI’d be attacked and it’d be the end…
 There aren’t any openings ineither offense or defense this woman…
 Heh! She might bea pretty good Shogi player.
 My remaining Ninja toolsare twelve kunai knives,
 nine shuriken, twelve meters of wire,one Flash Bomb and one Paper Bomb…
 Man…
 I feel like I’m playing withoutrooks or bishops.
 Did I lose them?
 I guess that’s not possible…
 Akamaru?
 Here. Eat this, Akamaru.
 If you don’t eat you won’tget your strength back.
 All right. Akamaru, let’s go!
 There’s the issue of those guys too…
 Dance of the Camellia!
 There’s no use hiding.
 Unless you can predictthese guys’ movements
 there’s nowhere you can run, little rat.
 I’ll find you and break youinto pieces right away!
 Now then...
 All right. Everything’s ready.All that remains is to do it.
 There’ll be nine attacks.
 The outcome will be decidedduring the attacks.
 One!
 One!
 Wishful thinking!
 The Jutsu manipulated bythis sound is invincible.
 Whatever plans you haveto win against me…is useless!
 Two!
 Scampering around, you little rat!Where are you?!
 Three!
 So you’re over there!
 Four!
 So it’s a cheap trick.You think you can make a fool of me?!
 Five…six…
 seven…eight…
 Scurrying around to get away.What is he thinking?
 Light?!
 Nine!
 Oh no!
 He’s lengthened the shadowswith light and …
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu…a success!
 That’s impossible…
 How were you able to predictthese guys’ movements?!
 There’s no way you could have heardthe differences in my music patterns!
 I wasn’t listening tothe sounds at all.
 There’s something otherthan the sounds
 that give away your command patterns,isn’t there?
 Your fingers!
 It can’t be!
 The movement of the three...
 Are you saying you memorizedmy finger movements and predicted?
 There’s no way that’s possible!
 Your right index fingerand ring finger…
 The sound that you makewith those
 along with the left middle fingerand pinkie,
 that middle crab pincher manstands ready.
 Your right thumb and index finger,
 and your left index finger and pinkie,the club man charges.
 While you were dodging my attacksand looking for me,
 I was observing each and every oneof your finger moves in detail…
 analyzing and memorizing them.
 It’s no use…
 They’re bound byShadow Possession Jutsu.
 The most interesting ruleof the Shogi play is that
 you can use pieces you obtainas your own pieces.
 From here on out…it’s my turn to attack…
 This time I’ll hunt you downusing the three pieces.
 You’re looking pretty composed.
 Stand ready with a kunai knifeat least.
 My weapon is just this flute!
 I told you that there hasn’t been a person
 who’s heard the sound ofthis flute and lived, idiot!
 That’s some confidence!
 Retreat!
 Too bad you aren’t able touse the pieces, hey!
 Next it’s my turn!
 What?!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu,successful.
 I told you.
 That I’d hunt you downusing the pieces.
 I used the three pieces as bait.
 In attacking, the first handis the trick, a fake.
 The basics are to scorewith the second hand.
 Bastard…
 It can’t be helped.
 Now that it’s come to thisI’ll need to force out with power.
 I didn’t think that I’d get tosecond state in a place like this…
 It ticks me off but…
 I’ll acknowledge it.
 This guy was a pretty impressive scum.
 What is…this?
 It’s true you’re somewhat sharp, but…
 It won’t go asyou’ve planned from here!
 What?!
 Is she gonna force herself outof the Shadow Possession Jutsu?
 What’s with that tremendous Chakra?
 The Jutsu’s gonna come loose!
 I can’t be worrying aboutsaving Chakra anymore.
 There’s no other waybut to use that Jutsu!
 Ninja Art: Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
 Is he grabbing my bodywith the shadow?
 It’s just as if I’m being grabbedby a real hand…
 But, no more than this!
 Damn! What an incredible strength.
 At this distanceI’ll lose to that strength!
 Take this!
 Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!
 This is bad!
 Is this a…Genjutsu?
 Where are you aiming?
 I can’t move my body…
 While in second stage,
 I manipulate many Genjutsuwith my flute.
 Of those, this one isan appropriate for that little rat.
 The reason is…
 This Genjutsu stops the movementof the prey and ties it up!
 How’s that? How’s it feel tobe the one tied up?
 So this was your last move huh?Unfortunately, it’s a return checkmate!
 Little rat!
 What…?
 This guy...
 He broke his own fingerwith his own shadow!
 Did he release the Genjutsuwith that pain?
 On top of that, he kept pretending tobe bound by the Jutsu?!
 I told you this already
 that the first hand is the trick,a fake.
 The basics are to scorewith the second move.
 Moreover this second move…it’s a little different from earlier.
 With the Shadow Strangle Jutsu,
 the closer in distance you areto the subject the stronger the hold.
 Damn. I carelessly got too close…
 No, that’s not it.
 The most careless thing wasthe words you said earlier,
 “my weapon is just the flute.”
 You’re looking pretty composed.
 Stand ready with a kunai knife at least.
 My weapon is just this flute!
 I told you thatthere hasn’t been a person
 who’s heard the sound of this fluteand lived, idiot!
 No way…
 That’s right.
 The reason I threw the kunai kniferight in front of you and missed…
 was to lead you to pick it upand come closer to me, you see?
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 No way, that’s ridiculous!
 Am I having a dream or something?!
 But it’s too intense to be a dream!
 That suit with its outstandingventilation and supple fit.
 On top of that, those eyes,that hair, those eyebrows!
 You! Why are you here…?!
 Next time: “The Leaf’s Handsome Devil!”
 I sense the approach of a storm!

 The distance created between usbecame too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouthmakes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile,even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 The Bewildering Forest
 Hey kids, get out of hereif you don’t wanna get hurt.
 Better not think lightly of me!
 I’m not gonna hand this guy over,no matter what!
 Ninja Dropouts…
 It’s not gonna end up withyou just getting hurt.
 You’re gonna get killed.
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Ninja Art: Blood Rain.
 Todoroki!
 Damn!
 My Jutsu isn’t Ninjutsu.
 It’s Killer Jutsu.
 Sakura!
 Lee, are you all right?
 Yeah, just barely.More importantly, where’s Naruto?
 Is everybody safe?
 Yes. However, Commander Todorokiis nowhere to be seen!
 What was that?!
 Naruto…
 Naruto…
 Die!
 Damn! Let go, you jerk!
 Naruto!
 Damn!
 Father! Mother!
 Akio!
 Akio!
 What a shame…
 You’re not getting backwith your comrades.
 Todoroki! Gantetsu!
 Are you all right?!
 Y-Yeah… We’re fine.
 What are we going to do now?
 We’ve gotten separated fromSakura and Bushy Brows…
 There isn’t any question in my mind.
 It’s my mission to deliverthis guy to the capital.
 But the ship’s been destroyed, and…
 Those guys are pursuing us!
 What are you doing?!
 If they’re gonna steal this guyaway from us anyway,
 it would be better totake care of him right here!
 What do you mean take care of him…?
 Even if we delivered him the capital,
 it’s certain thathe’ll be sentenced to death…
 Therefore…
 Rather than having themtake him away, it would be better to…!
 It’s not set in stone thatthey’ll be able to take him away!
 Let’s go!
 Your mission is to guard this guy, right?
 That’s exactly what my mission is too!
 If you so much as try anything,your head’s gonna roll!
 Run!
 We’ll be fine…now that we’ve come this far…
 Looks like we’ve totally lost them.
 We’ve gone pretty deepinto the forest, haven’t we?
 I can get our bearings fromthe position of the moon.
 It’s too dangerous to go backto the river.
 We’ll continue straight throughthis forest to the capital.
 Because it’s my mission.
 Are you sure it’ll be okay?
 What do you mean?
 You said earlier you were goingto finish this guy off, right?
 I was talking abouta worst-case scenario.
 Got it…Well then, let’s get moving.
 I wonder if Sakura is all right…
 Naruto…
 It’s Naruto…He’s gonna be just fine.
 Yeah…
 So let’s hurry up and link up with him!
 Lee!
 I detect something strange…
 Where…?
 Up above!
 Lee!
 Let’s follow him!The enemy might have captured Naruto!
 What’s the matter?
 We’re walking in the directionof the moon, right…?
 Then why is the moon following us?
 That’s strange…
 What’s going on…?
 The Forest of Bewilderment…
 Once you get lost you cannever find you way out again.
 He talked…
 You are in custody.You’re not allowed to talk!
 Wait a second!
 The Forest of Bewilderment…
 You know something about this place?
 What do you know? Tell us!
 The Ninja Dropouts havea hide-out in this forest.
 What was that?!
 So we were escorting youthrough Ninja Dropout territory…?!
 This forest is perfect for a hide-out.
 The fog, the winds thatsweep through the forest,
 the extreme magnetic fields…
 They all make a person losetheir sense of direction.
 A person finding himself inthis forest for the first time
 will never find his way out.
 I don’t believe that…
 There’s no way we won’t findour way out…?
 You guys won’t.
 Huh?
 But for me, a member ofthe Ninja Dropouts…
 the outcome will be different.
 I will…
 I will guide you through this forest.
 Yeah, that’s right…
 For you, a Ninja Dropout,this forest is like your backyard, right?
 Okay then, let’s have you guide us!
 Are you some kind of idiot?!
 It’s true…
 The finesse that the Ninja Dropoutsshowed earlier on
 makes sense if you thinkthat this is their garden…
 And I’ll believe you when you sayyou have a hide-out here.
 Then even more so…
 Even more so, it's a no!
 Huh…?
 Don’t you get it?
 This guy is gonna pretend tobe guiding us out of the forest
 but will actually be taking usto the hide-out.
 Todoroki…
 This is an emergency situation…
 If we don’t kill him, we’ll be killed.
 W-Wait a minute!
 Nobody’s gonna care…if this guy dies!
 Todoroki!
 What’s that…?
 I took all the money the Ninja Dropoutshad stolen up to now…
 So I was tortured…
 Those guys don’t want to rescue me…
 They just want to get that moneyback from me.
 Once they have the money back,those guys will kill me too.
 Do you really think I’ll believe that?
 Wait a second!
 The Ninja Dropouts hide-out ishere in this forest, right…?
 Which means it’s likea backyard to them too,
 just like it is for Gantetsu…
 Which means that…
 Which means that what?
 Well, since we've trespassedinto their garden
 it’s likely that the Ninja Dropoutswill come after us
 whether Gantetsu’sbetrayed them or not…
 So I think our only option is topin our hopes on this guy…
 Am I wrong?
 Hey, are you sureyou know what you’re doing?
 Yeah, everything’s fine.
 Those guys won’t figure outthis kind of circuitous route.
 Can we really trust this guy…?
 What?!
 I’m used to it’s venom. It’s nothing.
 Are you really gonna be all right?
 Yeah…
 Hey!
 What’s the matter?
 No way!
 You fell for it. You fell for it!
 Here it comes!
 Ninja Art: Crimson Mud!
 Die!
 You’re the one who fell for it!
 I combined the Shadow Clone Jutsuand the Transformation Jutsu.
 What was that?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Now it’s my turn!
 Rasengan!
 I’m gonna strike you down!
 Don’t think it’s gonna be thateasy to strike me down!
 Like I'll let you get away!
 Naruto!
 That guy! Trying to get away, huh!
 What are you doing?
 Th-That sound is…
 What?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Thanks to you we made it…Gantetsu.
 What's with you guys?
 They want to fight, it seems.
 I won’t… I won’t be fooled.You…you…
 We’ll be safe if we just follow Gantetsu.
 Todoroki!
 Stop it, Todoroki!
 You said you were going to deliverGantetsu to the capital, right?
 This guy…
 There’s no way I’ll forgive this guy!
 What are you talking about?!
 This guy…
 This guy killed my family…he killed my little brother!
 Wh-What was that…?
 Gantetsu…
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 It’s true that Gantetsu may be evil,
 but how is taking revenge outon him going to change things?!
 Isn’t our mission to take Gantetsuto the capital?
 And I… I don’t think thathe’s an evil person.
 Anyway, you leave meno choice if you won’t listen.
 I’ll stop you with all my strength!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 What's with you?!
 Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns!
 Good morning!
 Here.
 Thank you.
 Naruto didn't come backlast night, either?
 He's such a fool,
 he's been out every night,climbing trees.
 He might be dead alreadyfrom using up too much Chakra.
 I wonder if Naruto's okay.
 To think a child's out inthe middle of the night.
 Well, you don't need to worry.
 Although he may not seem to be,he's a full-fledged Ninja.
 I wonder…
 That idiot's probablyall pooped out right about now.
 Sasuke?
 I'm going for a walk.
 But we're about to eat…
 That was fast!
 You'll catch a cold ifyou keep sleeping here.
 Who're you?
 Uh... Did you wake me up, sis?I mean, what're you doing here?
 I'm gathering medicinal herbs.
 Herbs?
 Yes. For healing injuries,sickness and the like.
 You got a lot to do earlyin the morning, sis...
 You, too.
 What've you been doingin a place like this so early?
 Training!
 Could it be that…you're a Ninja or something?
 What with that headband and…
 Is that what I look like? Is it?
 Yup! I'm a Ninja!
 No kidding.You're great, aren't you.
 But…why are you training?
 As for me,I want to get stronger!
 But, you already lookstrong enough.
 No, no! I want to geteven stronger!
 What for?
 To become the best Ninjain my village!
 I'm going to get everyoneto recognize my strength!
 And I have to prove somethingto a certain person!
 Is that for the sake of somebody?Or is it for your own sake?
 Huh?
 What's so funny?!
 Do you have somebodyprecious in your life?
 Precious…?
 What is it you want to say, sis?
 What is it?
 When a person has somethingprecious they want to protect…
 that's when they can trulybecome strong.
 Your dad loves the townyou're from, so…
 I absolutely won't allowmy comrades to get killed!
 Get your hands off Iruka Sensei!
 I'll kill you!!
 Yeah! I know that well, too!
 You'll get strong.
 Yeah!
 I hope we meet again somewhere.
 Oh…and…
 I'm a man!
 That can't be!He's cuter than Sakura.
 Why? That's strange.
 This world is full of mystery…
 Ouch.Hey! What're you doing?!
 Did you forget about mealtime,you idiot?
 Naruto?
 What in the world is Naruto doing?
 And Sasuke hasn't come backfrom his walk either…
 No way…Naruto can climb that high now?
 Wow!
 How 'bout that, how 'bout that?!
 As for me,I can climb this high now!
 Whoa!
 Oh, you idiot!
 This is bad!
 Gotcha!
 You fell for it, you fell for it!
 Don't scare us like that!
 I'll kill him later! Cha!
 He's grown a little, eh.
 Oh! You idiot, Naruto!
 It's cuz you went overboard!
 You fool.
 Sasuke…?
 Nice, Sasuke.You're awesome !
 These kids are really growing.
 Naruto…
 Uzumaki, eh.
 You've recovered considerably.
 All right…
 Just a little more, Haku.
 Yes.
 Shall we go back?
 Okay!
 They're late.
 And not just Naruto,but even Sasuke too.
 What happened to you guys?
 You're really muddyand really wiped out.
 We both…climbed up to the top.
 Good.
 Naruto, Sasuke, you'll also start guardingTazuna next time!
 Got it! Whoa!
 You idiot!
 In just a teeny little bit,the bridge will be complete.
 It's thanks to you guys.
 Even so, don't let your guard down…
 I've really wanted to ask you for a long time now…
 But why are you still hereeven though I lied about the mission?
 To see what is right without doing itbespeaks an absence of courage.
 Like master, like man.
 It's a teaching of the late Hokage.
 The things I trulyhold dear to myself…
 I'll protect until the very endwith both these arms.
 Don't cry…lnari.
 Why…?
 What is it?
 Why do you desperately work so harduntil you get like that?!
 There's no way you'd bea match for Gato's men even if you train!
 No matter what cool things you sayor how much effort you make…
 the weak always lose out…
 against the truly strong!
 Shut up. I'm not like you.
 Shut up!Looking at you makes me sick!
 Sticking your nose in even thoughyou know nothing of this land!
 I'm not like you who's alwaysacting frivolous
 not knowing one thing about pain!
 So you're just gonna cryall day like the lead in a tragedy?
 An idiot like you can just cry forever!You crybaby!
 Naruto! That's a bit harsh!
 Naruto…
 Got a minute?
 Naruto didn't mean any harmwith what he said…
 He's just uncouth, so…
 We heard the storyabout your father from Tazuna.
 Like you, Naruto never hada father as a young child…
 Actually he doesn't know eitherof his parents.
 Not only that.He didn't have a single friend.
 What?
 However…
 I've never seen him sulk,be timid, or cry.
 He's always eager,wanting to be acknowledged by someone.
 If it's for the sake of that ""dream,""he always risks his life.
 He's probably tired of crying.
 So, he knows the true meaningof the word strong.
 Like your father.
 Naruto might understand your feelingsthe most.
 What Naruto said earlier…
 There's no mistaking thathe's told himself that over and over again.
 Okay, then!I leave Naruto in your hands.
 Because he's used his bodyto the limit…
 I don't think he'll be ableto move today.
 Mr. Kakashi, are you feeling all right?
 Yes, somehow.
 We'll be going!
 What're you doing?
 I didn't hire you guys for charity work…
 Hey, are you listening, Zabuza?!Hey!!
 Shall we go…Haku?
 Yes.
 I overslept!
 Hey hey!! Where is everyone?
 Naruto. Your Sensei wanted youto rest and relax…today
 I knew it.
 They left me behind.
 I'll be back.
 Darn it!They could've woken me up!
 W-What the heck is this?!
 What is going on?What's happened?
 It couldn't be…
 Inari! Give me a hand.
 Inari!?
 I'll be right there.
 This mist…
 Sasuke! Sakura!They're coming!
 I knew he was still alive.
 Making an appearance so soon, eh…
 Say, Kakashi Sensei.
 This is his…Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.
 I see you've got those bratswith you as always.
 He's still trembling. Poor thing.
 I'm trembling with…excitement.
 Do it, Sasuke.
 I can see it!
 Well-well. So he couldsee the Water Clones, eh.
 That brat's grown quite a bit.
 This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
 So it seems.
 Phew, that was a close shave.
 Sorry I was late.But Inari, you were great.
 I was able to save your momthanks to your courage.
 Hey, wait a minute.
 Doesn't the fact thatwe were attacked mean
 that Kakashi Sensei andthe others are in danger too?!

 Hah! There’s no wayI’m going back!
 Let’s go!
 Right!
 What does that kid thinkhe’s doing?
 Looks like he’s run away.
 Idate’s been like thatfrom long ago.
 You know him?
 Yes, kind of…
 The Race is On!Trouble on the High Seas!
 I knew he’d run away,that bastard Idate.
 Knowing him this long,you must’ve figured this would happen.
 It was a mistake to let him run!
 You idiots!ldate isn’t that kind of kid!
 – Boss! 					– Boss…
 I believe in Idate.
 He must have a plan.
 Jirocho!
 Chief Retainer!
 How do you thinkyou’re going to settle this?
 You've turned this grand traditionalfestival into a mere farce…
 And worse,in the presence of the lord!
 Sir, the race has just begun.Please watch it until the end.
 Since you insist that much,you had better win.
 If you lose…
 I’ll ask for the dissolutionof your family!
 Agreed! I’m a man of my word.
 If Idate loses,you may do anything you wish.
 How like Wasabi’s Jirocho.Such confidence.
 Don't let us down.
 I’m counting on you, Idate.
 Boss…
 Give me your money!
 Just be still!
 A starving thief, huh…
 Sh-Shut up!
 A kid trying to act tough!
 With that little thing,
 you can’t even peel an apple,can you?!
 Here!

 Edged tools aren’tfor hurting people.
 You don’t have anywhere to go,do you?
 I’m Jirocho of Wasabiof Degarashi Port.
 Wasabi…Jirocho?
 How about it?Why don’t you come to my place?
 I-I just tried to…
 Anyone on the verge of starvationwill make such mistakes…

 Ah…this…
 I gave it to you. 					Keep it.
 Don’t ever do stupid thingslike stealing…

 Listen!Make me your henchman!
 No, I mean…could you please, Boss!

 Idate…My name is Idate Morino.

 Boss, just trust in me!I will win, no matter what!
 We can catch upto him in a bit!
 But it’s too late now!
 He can’t win ifhe’s this far from the port!
 No, he may've planned to comethis way from the very beginning.
 What?
 Huh?
 How lucky!
 Now, we can stop them here.
 At any rate…
 who would’ve thoughtthey’d be escorting him.
 Double Lucky!Now I can pay them back.
 For what they did to usduring the Chunin Exams.
 You two go ahead.I’ll keep them here.
 All right!
 Finally, we’ve caught up to you!
 Hey, wait!
 Geez! Why on earthdid you come this way?!
 Shut up!lt’s none of your business!
 What kinda attitude is that?!
 I said to shut up!
 Watch out!
 They aren’t aware of it, are they?
 Of Genjutsu?
 Hey, I said wait up!
 I’ve already been here?
 Darn! Looks likeI’ve been tricked by Genjutsu.
 Wha-?!
 If that’s the case…
 Release!
 There!
 H-Hey!
 No! Don’t go that way!
 Huh? What’s going on?
 I’m out of it!
 Just be still!
 We’ll get pulled up now!
 That was close…
 A double Genjutsu.
 Pretty elaborate trick.
 You idiot! It’s your fault thatwe’re going through all this!
 What did you say?!
 Hey, stop! Stop, I said!
 My Ninja tools!
 That was an unnecessary help!
 Did you say unnecessary?!
 Hey bastard, can’t you eventhank us for saving you?!
 You saved mebecause it’s your duty!
 No need to thank you!
 What did you say?!
 Stop, Naruto. He’s right.
 But if you don’t want to die,you should stay close to us.
 Hey, where are you going?!
 Aren’t you going backto Port Degarashi?
 Stupid, I’m heading north from here!
 North? Is it faster that way?
 Yeah…
 Who knows…I really don’t trust this guy!
 This is why Ninja are no good.
 What?!
 At this time of year,
 a strong seasonal wind blowsacross this ocean…
 At the starting point, I watched the cloudsand realized it…
 That the wind was coming.
 On top of that,at the port to the north,
 there’s an ocean currentthat flows straight to Nagi Island.
 This part is different from you guys.Right here!
 Looks like it’s getting a bit rough.
 Hey, don’t push it!
 Head more towards the south!
 But that’ll take up quite some time.
 Once we get on the land,no one can run faster than I can.
 My victory is already set!
 All right…
 I taste salt in the air.
 It’s the ocean!
 What is it that far out on the ocean?
 It’s the halfway point --Nagi Island where Modoroki shrine is.
 I can get there within an hour.Wait for a sec.
 Hey, old man, I’m here!lt's Idate from the Wasabi Family!
 Ah, I’ve been waiting for you.
 Looks like I was right.
 I’ll need you to lend me a boat.
 I see. I have it ready.
 Use that boat.
 It’s the fastest boat around here.
 I'm grateful to you!
 No problem. Boss Jirocho has doneso much for me.
 So, don’t lose to Wagarashi!
 I’m fed up with howthey handle things.
 Leave it to me!
 I may be down on my luck now,
 but I'm Idate, the number onehenchman of the Wasabi Family!
 Rest easy and leave it all to me!
 Yeah, right.
 We should start seeingNagi Island’s port soon.
 I hope we can get therebefore Fukusuke.
 Hey, Naruto…What do you think?
 Hm? What about?
 That Idate…
 He’s definitely notan ordinary man.
 He can run extraordinarily fast.
 He could have receivedspecial training…
 What kind of training?
 Like, maybe he’d beenin a hidden village.
 A guy that stupid can’t be a Ninja!
 Who’s talking here?!You're as stupid as he is!
 B-But…
 I made it to the final roundof the Chunin Exam!
 You were in the final roundof the Chunin Exam?!
 Yeah, that’ s right!

 I could have won the tournamentand become a Chunin!

 Really, the level ofthe Chunin Exam has dropped…

 Idate Morino.
 Morino… That’s right!

 Be quiet, you rotten runts!

 I’m the proctor forthe first test of the Chunin Exam.
 My name is Morino Ibiki.
 Morino… Ibiki…
 What did you say?
 Brother I-Ibiki is alive?!
 Yes…
 Of course, he’s alive!
 He gave me a weird problemon the 10th question…
 Is that true?He really is alive?!
 Wh-What’s this?!
 An ambush!
 How is it?
 As you can see,it’s right in front of us.
 Then, let’s get startedon our plan!
 Darn!
 Naruto and I will chase them away!
 Sakura, take care of Idate!
 Isn’t it better to run…?
 Too late for that!
 I’ll cover you. Remove the ropes!
 Gotcha!
 Darn! I have to cut these!
 Darn it! I lost them all that time!
 Hey, lend me that thing!
 What?!
 Just hand it to me, hurry!
 Bastard, this is more importantthan my life.
 There’s no wayI’ll let you use it…
 This is no time to be sayingstuff like that!
 S-Stop you idiot!
 Hurry up, you loser!
 Heh, piece of cake!
 Sakura! They are just clones!
 Only the real one can attack you,so don’t worry!
 Sharingan!
 Sakura, Naruto!
 The real ones are hiding amongthe clones! Be careful!
 Sasuke! Guide us!
 Idate, stay close to me!
 Hah! I don’t want a Ninja’s help!
 Are you still saying thatin this situation?!
 Naruto! Behind you!
 Naruto!
 A clone?!
 Oh, shoot!
 – Clone for clone!– Clone for clone!
 Damn, they got away.
 Nice work! Naruto!
 That Shadow Clone kidis troublesome.
 The next plan, Kagari!
 We’ll kill them all!
 Water Style!Black Rain Jutsu!
 Sasuke! They’ve changedinto Water Clones!
 I know!
 Rain?
 No! This is oil!
 How annoying!I’ll get rid of them all at once!
 That’s Tiger Seal!
 Sasuke, no!
 Oops…
 Unlucky…
 Humph, not really.
 Fire attack?!
 B-Brother…
 Go! Having you stay will bea burden to me!
 B-Brother…
 Idate?
 N-Nothing!
 Sasuke, what can we do?!
 If the fire is this strong…
 We’ll have to dive into the ocean!
 From here, we can swimto the port of Nagi Island!
 Right! There’s no other option left.
 Idate, can you swim?
 Y-Yeah…
 Hurry! I’ll cover you, so go first!
 This smoke should help youescape unnoticed!
 Idate?!
 There’s no way!
 Wha--?
 You are tricking me intobecoming a decoy!
 What are you talking about?!
 You’re trying to getthe enemy’s attention to me!
 That’s nonsense!
 No! I don’t trust Ninja!
 What are you doing? Go!
 Having you stay will bea burden to us!
 Go! Having you stayis a burden!
 Hurry up and go!
 There’s no way we willuse you as a decoy!
 N-No…
 Cha!
 Idate! Duck down!
 Trust me Idate!I promise I’ll protect you!
 Watch out!
 Sa…!
 Sakura!
 S-Sakura…
 Go on ahead…
 We’ll follow you right after!
 A-All right…
 Well, shall we withdraw now?
 Withdraw?
 The most enjoyable partis still left undone.
 Darn, they areunexpectedly tenacious.
 Yeah. But we won’tlet them get away.
 I-I should be okay here…
 Long time no see, Idate.
 Y-You are…
 I have taught you so many timesnot to trust anyone.
 Such a fool, you are…
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 Fool or whatever…lt doesn't matter now how you used to be.

 A hot spring?
 Yeah, just off of this roadthere’s a nice town with a hot spring.
 Yunosato Hot Springs…
 They say it does a world of goodfor fatigue and beauty.
 Aren’t we going straight home?Everyone’s waiting!
 Naruto’s right.
 Our hometown is ina state of emergency,
 there’s no time to procrastinate.
 It won't make much differenceif we’re one or two days late…
 It’s really popular with girls,and it’s mixed bathing…
 Hey?! Pervy Sage?
 Sometimes it’s necessary for humansto take breathers.
 We’ll take one bath!
 That’s not what you said before!
 It’s okay. Well, let’s go!
 That’s her, no mistake.
 We’ve finally…found her.
 Kidnapped!Naruto’s Hot Spring Adventure!
 We have the pleasure ofa visit from four people and one piglet.
 – Welcome! 					– Welcome!
 Even though this has mixed bathing…
 I’m all alone with this brat.I’m so unlucky.
 Well then, shall we play pachinkoor something?
 We have plenty of time before dinner.
 You’re not going to the hot spring?
 If we go right now, there are fools…
 So, let’s go, let’s go.
 I’m going to get out already.
 Not yet, not yet.Not until the girls get here.
 Oh, I see…
 Well, c’mon girls.All of you, come on…
 Welcome!
 Ah, that was refreshing.
 W-We've been robbed!
 The necklace I got fromOld Lady Tsunade is gone!
 Where! Where is it?!
 ""If you want your necklace back,give back the money""?
 ""Will wait at the three cedars onthe mountain behind.""
 Signed, the Akagi Family.
 Money?
 What are they talking about?
 Girls came in, all right.
 But…
 they’re all female monkeys!
 I want to bathe with people.
 Hey, here I am!
 Come out! Akagi Family!
 What do you want, kid?!
 That’s my line!
 I haven’t borrowed any moneyfrom you people!
 So give me my necklace back!
 “My” necklace?
 Did we mistake his stufffor that woman's?
 Ah, that’s it!Give it back!
 W-Wait!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Go!
 You thieves!
 – Take this! 					– Go!
 H-Help…
 People came, all right…
 But…
 They’re all men!
 – Bring it on! 					– Cheers!
 I want to bathe with women…
 Huh? So the one who borrowed moneyis Old Lady Tsunade?
 Yes…nicknamed“the Legendary Sitting Duck.”
 She played at the Akagi gambling denuntil she was penniless.
 We loaned her what she lost.
 That’s right, and there’s an I.O.U.
 Wha--?! There are so many zeros!
 I’m Senta, this guy is called Bunzo.
 The boss ordered us to collecton the debt three years ago…
 We set out on a journeyfrom Akagi Mountain
 prepared not to returnuntil we get the money back.
 We’ve heard rumors aboutthe lady here and there…
 But, she sure was something.
 She was elusive and quite hard to find.
 Then recently, we caughtsome information that she’d appeared.
 We were waiting onthe side of the road…
 That’s when we came alongwith Old Lady Tsunade.
 But why did you raid the roomso stealthily?
 Rumor has it that
 that ordinary means don't workagainst the “Legendary Sitting Duck.”
 We didn’t think thatif we tried to collect amicably,
 she would pay us.
 She’s certainly stingy…
 We heard that she cherished the necklacenext to her life,
 so we thought she’d payin exchange for it.
 No way. After all, you raided my room.
 We never even dreamed that the ownerof the necklace would have changed…
 Err… Can’t you ask the lady to pay?
 Uh, even you say so...
 Please! If we don’t get the money back,we can’t go home!
 Our wives and kids are waiting for usto come home!
 – Please…I’m begging you!– Please…I’m begging you!
 It’s all gone…
 Bad luck…Darn it. I’m stone broke.
 Well, let’s call it quits with pachinko.
 It’s about time for a bath…
 – Shizune… 					– Yes?
 My bag is at the front desk of the inn.
 What?!Y-You can’t mean to bring it here?!
 Everything to your name is in it…
 I’ve just lost! I can’t repress this feeling!
 Just bring it without complaint.
 Yes, ma'am!
 Huh? Could you be…
 Y-You are…!
 There are women, all right…
 But…
 I was hoping for younger,more titillating women…
 This one, right?
 Thank you…
 Are you with Ms. Tsunade?
 Yes.
 This came for her not long ago…
 To Tsunade		A letter? I wonder who could’ve…?
 Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Huh? Lady Tsunade!
 She’s not here…
 Okay, Tonton…
 You know to search forLady Tsunade, right!
 What, impossible? Why?
 I see! The smell of the sulfurfrom the hot spring interferes…
 Well then, the only wayto search for her is on foot!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
 Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
 Where are you!
 We have a problem!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Oh, what in the world should I do?
 We have Naruto Uzumaki.
 If you want him returned unharmed,please return all of the money you owe!
 We'll wait by the three cedars onthe mountain behind. The Akagi Family
 What should I do?I have to help Naruto.
 On top of that, if it’s discoveredthat Lady Tsunade has a huge debt,
 talk of her installment asthe Fifth Hokage will probably end.
 That’s right, we haveto handle this by ourselves.
 Right, Tonton?
 Do you think it’s going to work out well?
 No problem.
 Here she comes.
 Old Lady Tsunade!
 Stop!
 You know who we are, right?
 You’re the henchmen of the Akagi.
 Then I'll make it brief.
 Pay back your debtin one lump sum.
 Or else…
 his life is over!
 Help me!
 Whatever.His life doesn’t matter much to me.
 – Huh!– What did you just say?!
 Well then, the money…
 Why did it come to this?
 This isn’t titillating,this is just tight!
 Drats! Let me have patience!
 Didn’t you hear me?
 It doesn’t matter to mewhat happens with his life.
 You… darn old hag!
 Was what I would have said,until just a little bit ago, I think.
 Once I become the Hokage,he’d be a precious subordinate.
 I can’t leave him in the mess.
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 Right now, this is all I’ve got.Take it.
 Let me make sure of this.
 I don’t mean it’s paid off in full,but that’ll do it for the interest, right?
 Fake!
 You’re not going to paythe money back?
 It's none of your business.
 These guys can’t go home!Don’t you feel sorry for them!
 You couldn’t possibly?
 In that case, I’ll have to use forceto get it back!
 Naruto’s Shadow Clones?!
 I see, Naruto has joined handswith the Akagi Family…
 So, where did Naruto and company go?
 As expected…
 I didn’t think she’d handthe money over meekly.
 But to be that much of a coward…
 What should we do?
 Old Lady Tsunade has a huge suitcase.
 No doubt there’s money in it.
 We have to do somethingto get our hands on that suitcase.
 Shoot!
 I'm supposed to be kidnapped,and she’s casually drinking sake.
 It’s that suitcase.
 How do we get it out?
 Leave it to me.
 Lady Tsunade, you’ve returned.
 Ah, here’s the suitcase.
 It’s dangerous,so let’s leave it at the front desk.
 Well then…
 Look, I went and got it!
 – You did it! 					– You did it!
 Old Lady Tsunade!
 Shoot… If you’re the Hokage…
 If you’re the Hokage,
 then pay your debt backlike a Hokage would!
 A Hokage is meantto protect everyone!
 These guys can’t return their home,they are desperate!
 Why don’t you do something?!
 Naruto…
 Or do people from other countriesnot matter to you?
 That kind of Hokage…I cannot accept!
 Now!
 Here!
 Hurry up and run away!
 – Right! 					– Okay!
 Oh, she’s already catching up!
 It’s all or nothing!
 Huh?
 – You did it! 					– You did it!
 Tonton?!
 Naruto!
 Just hand over the suitcase! Or else!
 F-Fork over the suitcase!
 If we take a direct hit fromOld Lady Tsunade’s attack,
 then it’s over!
 Out of the way, out of the way!
 Purse snatchers?
 Excuse us!
 Hey what’s going on?!
 Hey! Don’t cause troublefor the general public!
 It’s because you’re following us!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 What’s going on…?
 Naruto, we leave it up to you.
 This is no good.
 If the contents of that suitcasebecome known,
 it will be a disaster…
 That’s right, that happened too.
 And I was young then too.
 Gulp it down.
 Excuse me, Boss.
 What is it? You’re in front of a guest.
 W-Well…
 A clone!
 That’s a clone too?
 Wrong again.
 Sheesh, which is the real one?!
 The rest…
 – Where are the rest?!– Where are the rest?!
 Over there!
 – Hold it! 					– Hold it!
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 – Wait! 					– Wait!
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 Prepare yourself!
 Shoot, let me go! Let me go!
 Settle down!
 G-Got it!
 The money!
 Okay, they got it!
 IOU’s?!
 It’s not money?!
 – Oh no…– This is too much!
 What are you doing?!This is in the middle of town!
 Huh!
 T-Two Old Ladies?!
 You’re mixed up inthis commotion as well?
 I’d like to hear your reasonfor it, Shizune!
 Hello… Lady Tsunade…
 What?! Shizune…
 And you guys belong to the Akagi.
 B-Boss Jirocho!
 Who?
 You don’t know?!
 He’s the number one gang boss,Jirocho from the Land of Tea!
 He’s an old friend of mine.
 As luck would have it,we met by accident on the street.
 You’re Bunzo and Sentaif I’m not mistaken.
 Just in time.I have something to say to you!
 – What?! 					 – What?!
 You mean the debt to the Akagi Family?
 I paid it back a year ago.
 Is that true?
 That was last year,when we were near Akagi’s.
 Did you forget?
 I-I’m sorry.
 Hey!
 It’s a circular from Akagiaddressed to me.
 I’ll just read the part addressed to you.
 “Senta and Bunzo,
 “The debt is paid, come home soon.”Signed, Shugoro Akagi.
 See?
 You've gotta be kidding.
 All that energy spent, for nothing.
 – Thank you for helping us.– Thank you for helping us.
 – Now we can go home relieved.– Now we can go home relieved.
 Go in good spirits.
 – You too, Naruto. Take care!– You too, Naruto. Take care!
 Hey, if the suitcasedoesn’t have money in it,
 why were you so seriousabout getting it back?
 That’s…
 If the IOU’s were discoveredby the people in the village,
 they’ll oppose Lady Tsunade’sinstallment as Hokage.
 You worry too much.
 The Hokage and the debtare unrelated.
 Not only that,she said she returned the money,
 so there’s nothing to worry about.
 At least the Akagi debt was…
 What?
 Don’t worry, don’t worry!
 What? We forgot something?
 Finally, the time has come.
 Communal bathing with girls…
 Patience paid off…
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow

 Kakashi Sensei and Sasukeare all right now!
 You can't rejoice yet.
 The current situationin the village is serious.
 You're right.I have to do my best,
 And work hard forthe village as well.
 Hey! N-Naruto,where do you think you're going?!
 I have to fill my stomach first!
 You have no sense of emergency…

 No, it’s delivery protectionto be exact.
 There’s a higher risk of dangerthan a regular delivery.

 If you like,we could carry it for you instead.
 Now… Hand it over here.
 We’ll carry it for you with care.
 N-No…
 It’s not really anything valuable.
 I mean, how should I put it…right?
 That’s right. It’s not like that at all.Right, buddy?
 What’re you guys talking about?!lt’s extremely valuable.
 Have you forgotten that there’sa national treasure-class relic inside?!
 It’s the Beauty of Nature!
 It’s the Beauty of Naturemore valuable than human life!
 Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!

 Hey, buddy, do you understandthe situation?!
 Shut up! Situation?You gotta be kidding!

 The Beauty of Nature is mine.
 Oh no!
 Let’s go, Akamaru!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:
 Man Beast Clone!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Then…we’ll do this! Akamaru!
 Dynamic Marking!
 Whoa! What’s this?!
 Buddy, what’s the matter?!
 S-Something’s salty!
 I’m coming!
 Naruto, where are you?!
 Get over here now, you idiot!
 You’re late, Naruto!
 You okay, buddy?
 Naruto…
 Spraying piss?!I’ll pound you guys for sure!
 Taking back the treasure comes first!
 That’s right!
 Oh man! I knew I should’vetaken charge of it!
 If we trace the scent ofAkamaru’s Dynamic Marking,
 it should work out, but…
 I see, Akamaru…They’re still not far?
 All right, let’s go!
 We did it… We finally did it!
 What’re you doing?
 Shut up!
 They came to take this back!Let’s get out of here!
 You won’t get away!
 Hold it!
 Impertinent! Go!
 We’ll handle things here.
 So you go after him!
 –Right! 					–Let’s go, Kiba!
 Right!
 Hold it!
 You won’t get away, you jerk!
 It ends here! See you later!
 Let’s hurry!
 I won’t hand it over…!
 Let go!
 Boy, I was going to let youslide by with your life, but…
 Give it back…
 The Beauty of Nature…Give it back…!
 Haven’t youmisunderstood something?
 You’ll let me off with my life?
 That Beauty of Nature…
 is a super first-rate treasuremore precious than human life…
 The question of my lifewas never of a concern!
 Don’t make light of me! Got that?!
 You okay, buddy?!
 Jeez, you Genin are really useless.
 You’re all beaten up yourself, buddy!
 Y-You jerk!
 Damn it! I’ll put an endto things here at once!
 Everything’s over!
 We’ll be in a fixif we don’t hurry, Naruto!
 Let’s get a move on, brother!
 Buddy!
 Quick! Take the Beauty of Natureto a safe location.
 No way, what’re you saying?!
 You’ll get crushed if you don’t hurry.
 Wh-What’re you guys looking at?!
 Take the Beauty of Nature while you can…
 What’re you saying?!
 Hurry!
 Buddy! You okay?!
 Oh! The Beauty of Nature!
 Don’t move, buddy!Gently, hold out your hand!
 Idiot, what’re you doing?!
 Just hurry up and come this way!
 You guys are the idiots!Forget about me.
 If you’re Ninja,do something about
 the Beauty of Naturerather than my life!
 Naruto, let’s just forgetabout this guy!
 He should just die likea dog on his own!
 Let’s hurry and get out of here!
 Yeah, do as you like!
 The Beauty of Nature…
 Brother!
 Am I…going to die…?
 We were just about to die!
 Huh?
 Ninja are supposed to risk their lives
 on a commissioned mission, right?
 Come on…Get a move on if you’re not dead.
 It’s the Beauty of Nature!
 It’s the Beauty of Nature,more valuable than human life!
 Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!
 I’m gonna…just like this…
 Haven’t you misunderstood something?
 You’ll let me off with my life?
 That Beauty of Nature…
 is a super first-rate treasuremore precious than human life…
 The question of my lifewas never a concern!
 Heck no…
 I don’t want to die!
 There’s nothing in this worldmore valuable than life!
 Nice…bungee jump…
 Now then, what shall I do now?
 Y-Yeah…
 Sure enough…without the treasure…
 Don’t mope like that.That’s why you guys are useless.
 But there’s no point withoutthe treasure after all!
 Huh? If there isn’t one,then I just have to make one.
 Make…? You say thatlike it’s easy, but….
 That’s a picture of you, buddy.
 The creator of the dauntless artifact…
 Beauty of Nature …Shinemon, the living national treasure?
 So basically…?
 That means you madethe Beauty of Nature, buddy?!
 But, you’re…the client…
 You got a problem
 with the client being the creatorand a living national treasure?
 But no matter how you look at it…
 This here’s not like you guys!This here!
 Well, you know…
 It means my life rather thanthe treasure was the correct answer.
 You do pretty good work for Genin.
 Thanks for the help.
 Now then, I guess I’ll hurry
 and make a masterpiece toexceed the Beauty of Nature!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Your mission is to take that Ninja Dropoutwe caught all the way to the capital.
 What’s a Ninja Dropout?
 It’s a gang of thieves consistingof Rogue Ninja,
 who don’t consider themselvesShinobi anymore.
 I can’t forgive them for usingtheir Shinobi powers for evil.
 So, well, you can figure outthe rest by now.
 In other words,there is a possibility that they will
 come to save one of their own.
 Exactly.
 You are assigned to the missionof guarding the Gantetsu convoy!
 Roger!

 Oh! Bushy Brow!
 Oh… Good morning, Naruto.
 Hey, hey, did you already get checked outby Old Lady Tsunade?
 How was it, how was it?
 The Leaf Village isin great trouble right now,
 so we must do our best!
 You’re right.
 Bushy Brow, you should get betteras soon as possible
 and succeed in your mis--!
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 What’s the matter?
 It’s Konohamaru!
 Huh? What’s wrong with Konohamaru?
 He’s in trouble.
 In trouble?!
 The Will of Fire Still Burns
 At this rate,we will have to open it by force.
 Try it! Who do you think I am?!
 I am the grandson ofthe Third Hokage!
 If you go against me, then…
 It means you’re goingagainst the Hokage!
 We need Lady Tsunadeto assume her position immediately.
 Those are Pepper Smoke Bombs!
 You'll get something even more terribleif you come close to me.
 Honorable grandson! Even for you…
 There are things that canand cannot be forgiven!
 Shut up!
 What is all this commotionso early in the morning?
 It’s hurting my head.
 Lady Tsunade…
 It's just one kid…What're you doing?
 Yes…
 Get rid of him!
 But it’s the grandsonof the Third Hokage!
 It doesn’t matter ifhe’s the grandson or the great grandson.
 I am the granddaughterof the First Hokage!
 He might just open his eyesif he gets roughed up a little.
 Now move it!
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 Wait!
 Naruto?!
 Hey, hold on there.
 I don’t really knowwhat's going on,
 but don’t be so rough with Konohamaru,Old Lady Tsunade.
 An acquaintance of yours?
 Yes, yes…
 I’ll do the convincing,leave it to me.
 Then, do somethingby the end of the day!
 Oh, Lady Tsunade… Please wait!
 Excuse me.
 Oh, Sakura. Sasuke has alreadybeen discharged from the hospital.
 I’m actually here to see Lee today.ls he in the rehabilitation room?
 Not yet.That’s not like him to be late.
 I see.
 The probability of a successful surgeryis 50%, at best.
 And if it fails, you'll die!
 Hey, Konohamaru.What are you doing in there?!
 Hurry up and come out.Then let’s go eat some ramen.
 Don’t worry. It’s on me!
 You can have lots of BBQ pork, too!
 All right! You can have eggs too!How about that!
 At least answer me!
 Shut up, you fool!
 You called me a fool!
 Open up already! I’ll break in! Hey!
 Try if you can!
 W-Why you--!
 – Naruto… 					– Naruto!
 Oh, Lee… You’re here.
 S-Sakura!
 I wanted to bring you this.
 F-For… me?
 Th-Thank you very much!
 I-I’m sorry, Sakura.
 No worries.
 Sasuke is now recuperating at home.
 Thanks to Lady Tsunade.
 At this rate,
 seems like he’ll be ableto get back to his duties very soon.
 I see. That’s very good.
 Lady Tsunade is great, after all.
 I think if you had her take a look,you’d get better very quickly.
 Yes…
 But if there is somethingthat I can do,
 please feel free to tell me.
 Thank you very much, Sakura.
 Then I’ll see you soon.
 I would think that at leastone bar would be open.
 There’s no way.What time do you think it is right now?
 I can’t drink sake, and I can’t gamble.
 This place, the Hidden Leaf Village,is no fun at all.
 Just like the Third Hokage.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Oh, I’m tired.
 I just want to sit down andhave a drink somewhere.
 I understand.
 I will take you to a place whereyou can sit and have a drink.
 What?
 But I will have you do your work!
 Here now, go ahead. It’s hot.
 Shizune…you’ve suddenlybecome very strict!
 I haven’t gotten strict.lt’s probably that you were not aware.
 Not aware?!
 “If I can’t get in the room,then I don’t have to work.”
 Isn’t that what you were thinking?
 And that’s whyyou left it up to Naruto.
 Humph! Could be…
 This is the most recent listof Ninja.
 The names and lineups ofthe groups have changed a lot.
 So please look through them.And I mean, look through all of it!
 Oh bother.
 They have sweet rice cakes, too.
 I don’t like sweet things!
 Hey! Konohamaru, come out already!
 At least tell me why you’re doing this!
 Konohamaru!
 Darn!
 Everybody came here becausethey’re worried about you!
 If you don’t come out,I’m going to drag you out of there!
 Naruto Sacred Technique...
 Sexy Jutsu!
 Konohamaru, come out!
 Konohamaru, hurry!
 Hey! Say something at least!This is so embarrassing!
 Don’t fool around with me!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – Stop it already, Konohamaru!– Stop it already, Konohamaru!
 One, two…
 – Uh, what is this?– What the--?!
 What's going on?!
 Are you okay? Naruto?
 This is the Old Man’s room.
 Eight D-rank missions,three C-rank missions…
 I see, very much like the Kurenai team.
 We can easily figure outwhat the Third Hokage was thinking.
 This is the same astheir parents’ team.
 I see.
 Oh, I see. This team has their own specialtyand is well-balanced.
 My shoulders are stiff.
 I’m going to go getsome fresh air outside.
 Success…
 Success…
 Naruto…
 Uh… Darn!
 If that’s how you’re going to be,then I’m not going to go easy on you.
 This is the Old Man’s room!
 I won’t let anybodyuse this room besides him!
 The Old Man’s…?
 That’s why, as his grandson,I’m going to protect it!
 Fool! This isn’t the time for that!
 The Leaf Village is in great danger!
 So what?! It doesn’t matter to me.
 Are you seriously saying that?!
 Oh, now I’m mad!
 And I can easily tear down oneor two doors with my new powers--!
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 Oh! Watch out!
 W-Wow…
 Listen Konohamaru.
 The Hidden Leaf Village isin great trouble right now!
 Our forces have dropped to almost half,and we have to finish our missions!
 That’s what I taught you!
 Yeah… um… well…
 But if we don’t accomplishour missions,
 that’s letting other countries knowthat the village has been weakened.
 That’s what Iruka Sensei taught you!
 Do you not like Old Lady Tsunade?
 It’s not that!lt’s not that at all.
 Then what is it?
 Soon, nobody will call mehonorable grandson.
 Then I’ll just becomeplain old Konohamaru.
 So what’s wrong withplain old Konohamaru?
 No…
 Why, why?! You hatedbeing called honorable grandson!
 Everybody’s going to forgetabout the Old Man.
 The Old Man.
 They’re going to forget whata great Ninja he was,
 they’re just going to put him awaylike an old ashtray.
 The new Hokage will make all kindsof changes in the Leaf Village.
 That’s not true!
 The Hidden Leaf Village isthe Hidden Leaf Village.
 And besides,nobody will forget about the Old Man!
 No! They will never forget about him!
 They will forget, I guarantee it.
 They won’t forget!
 That’s a lie!
 It’s not a lie!You can’t believe what I am saying?!
 That’s right, I can't!
 Oh boy!
 Come with me, Konohamaru!
 We just have to get Old Lady Tsunadeto promise
 that she won’t changethe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 And then on top of that,
 we can get everybody to promise usthat they won’t forget about the Old Man!
 What?
 Isn’t that what you want?
 I can’t believe that I letLady Tsunade out of my sight!
 Did you find her, Tonton?
 Revitalizing the cells, I see.
 I’ve found you Lady Tsunade.
 What?
 Lady Tsunade is studying?!
 Be quiet! I can’t concentrate.
 Concentrate?!
 I’ve never heard you use that wordexcept when you're gambling.
 Is that Shizune’s voice?
 Shizune…
 Do you remember that Medical Ninjaby the name of Kabuto?
 What about him?
 His ability to create new cells.
 I was researching ways to usethat power on the patients.
 For Lee?
 If the 50% chance becomes 51%,it’s worth a try.
 It really depends on the individual’s traits.
 Even for you,it might be hard to acquire those powers.
 I’ll just have to try.
 I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
 It can’t be helped, Konohamaru.
 I am the Third Hokage, after all.
 If you don’t like it,you should just quit!
 Everybody from the villageis my family.
 To protect the family,that is the duty of a Hokage.
 Oh! Old Man!
 Just for today,I’m making a special exception.
 What’s the matter Konohamaru?
 Don’t you want to seeOld Lady Tsunade?
 No.
 I’ll just have to do it.I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
 It can’t be helped, Konohamaru.I am the Third Hokage, after all.
 It can’t be helped.I am the honorable grandson, after all.
 Huh?
 I am Konohamaru ofthe Hidden Leaf Village, after all!
 H-Hey Konohamaru, wait!
 What’s going on with him?Hey Konohamaru!
 Lady Tsunade?
 Nothing…
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 Back then, Sensei taught me
 that I would grow up to becomea great Ninja
 through lots of effort andcompetition with my rivals.
 His words put me at ease.
 A path opened up for mejust when I was unsure of myself.
 I realized that all I had to dowas try my best.
 But now…

 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark

 Hmph!
 Oh, not again!

 They've been sort of strange sincewe got back from the Land of Waves…
 Oh, it's almost uncomfortable...
 Hurry up and get here Kakashi Sensei!
 Cha!
 Well...Good morning, everyone...
 Today I got lost.
 Hey!
 Hey, hey... Kakashi Sensei!
 Our Group Seven always hasthe easy missions lately!
 Aren't there more excitingmissions where I can be more active,
 where I can use my Way of the Ninjaand my soul…you know?
 Oh yes yes...
 I basically understand whatyou're trying to say.
 Shoot!
 He's always making meindebted to him
 and making himself look goodduring our missions!
 I won't lose, no way!
 You little...!
 Today for sure!
 Hmm...You are so much trouble!
 That's what I'd like to say!
 Hey! What 're you doing, Naruto?We're going on our mission!
 Okay!
 You've been so annoying for a while!
 I'm not gonna lose to Sasuke!
 Hey you!
 What?
 Oh, Mrs.!
 I've gotten rid of all the weeds!
 What?
 What's wrong?
 Those... those aren't weeds.
 Huh?
 Those are herbsI grew in my garden!
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!
 Somebody…help…!
 No way! Free fall!
 Huh?
 You idiot.

 Oh no! That's because hestubbornly chose that big dog.
 Hey, hey! Wait a minute,wait a minute!
 That's the trap field over there…
 Yikes!
 Well! It's because you're so reckless!
 Geez, you are so much trouble.
 Zazuge--!
 If you act up any more, I'll finish you!
 Mmm…Teamwork hasn't been good lately.
 That's right, that's right!
 Sasuke, you're to blame forthe poor teamwork!
 You're always attracting attention!
 That's you, you idiot.
 If you don't want to owe mebig time...
 you just need to becomestronger than me!
 It seems like they're gettingalong worse than before...
 Shoot… 					This is frustrating!
 There're plenty of guys outsidewho are stronger than I am…
 Always making me go onthis kind of lame mission.
 Well then...
 Perhaps we should disperse.
 I do need to submit a reportabout this mission.
 Okay, then I'm going home.
 Oh! Hey!
 Sasuke, wait for me!
 Hey, how about...Why don't you and…
 Why don't we work on improvingour teamwork together?
 You're just like Naruto.100	01:59:31:10	01:59:35:03		JUST LIKE NARUTO
 If you have time to spend on me,why don't you practice a Jutsu!
 To tell you frankly,your abilities are less than Naruto's!
 LESS THAN NARUTO... CHA!!		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!
 That's right…
 It's always that way for meduring every mission.
 I'll never be able to reallydo anything at all.
 Sakura! Just let Sasuke be,and let's practice together!
 Huh?
 Sensei disappeared.
 Was he being thoughtful?
 Huh?
 Pretending to be…a rock?
 There's no such thing as a perfectlysquare rock with perfect holes!
 It's totally obvious!
 Just what you'd expect fromthe man I respect!
 You are my rival, aren't you!
 Hey! That's too much gunpowder!
 With an adult sexiness!
 I'm Moegi of the senior classat Kunoichi Preschool!
 I love factoring!
 Udon!
 The most brilliant Ninja in the village!Konohamaru!
 The three of us together arethe Konohamaru Gang!
 Here we are!
 I knew it was Konohamaruand friends.
 Huh? Why are you all wearing goggles?
 We're just copying whatyou used to do, bro!
 Oh…
 What's with the oh!
 Your reactions have beenpretty cold these days!
 So, did you want something?
 See? Cold.
 So, leader!Do you have some free time now?
 Nah!
 I have to train!
 What?! You said you'dplay Ninja with us today!
 Oh…? Is that right?
 Geez…
 If I played with these guysthey would make me hang out all day.
 Hmph! Why would a Ninja play Ninja?
 W-What is it?
 So, abilities less than this guy, huh?
 You are making me blushwith those stares…
 Naruto, who's she?
 She's been staring at him with eyeslike she's gonna kill him!
 Oh!
 You've been busierthan I thought, bro...
 Huh?
 Is she your...?
 This?
 Shucks, you guys arepretty sharp for kids!
 No way!
 Bro!
 What are you doing?!
 No! Leader!
 His pulse, his pulse …!
 You ugly wench! Ugly wench!
 Huh?!
 Nooooo!
 Hmph!
 Are you all right, Konohamaru?
 Oweee...
 Darn that broad foreheaded ugly wench!ls she a girl for real?
 Yikes!
 That hurt...
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 So, I have formally receivedthe report from you.
 Is Naruto getting along with the others?
 Hmm?
 Well, he's doing okay.
 I've been busy lately.
 I haven't had a chance to see himeven once since his return.
 I'm a little concerned...
 As you know, Iruka Sensei,Sasuke is also in our squad,
 and Naruto sees him as a rival,which is a little straining.
 But, the result is that his abilitiesare developing significantly.
 Almost to the point thathe might reach yours,
 the one he respects!
 I see…
 I wonder what it is?
 Shoot!
 Right now?
 These guys…
 Konohamaru!
 That hurt, little punk!
 Stop that. You'll get yelled at later!
 I'm sorry…I was fooling around…
 What are these two?
 Hey stop!Let go of that hand!
 Huh! So these are Leaf Village's Genin...
 Let's play with them beforethe strict one comes around.
 Let go!
 You're pretty lively,you little punk...
 You jerk!
 Wha--?! 					What was that?
 Leaf Village's Genin areweaker than I thought.
 T-These guys are foreign...
 Why are they here?
 Konohamaru…
 Konohamaru!
 Konohamaru!
 It... It hurts …
 Hey! If you don't let go of him,I won't forgive you! You fool!
 You're the fool!
 What are you gonna doby getting him worked up!
 You're ticking me off.
 I-I don't like little runts anyway.
 On top of that,
 you're a smart aleck forsomeone younger than me.
 Makes me want to break him.
 It's not on me.
 What's with this guy?He's crazy…
 Well, after this little squirt,it's the little runt that won't shut up!
 You!
 Huh?
 What do you think you're doingin someone else's Village, you…
 Sasuke!
 He's pretty cute.
 Bro!
 Another little punk to tick me off!
 Get lost!
 Wow! So cool!
 Naruto, you're lame!
 S-Stupid! I would've quicklytaken down that thug too!
 Hmph!
 Sasuke, you!
 Why're you always,always meddling like this!
 Hey, come down here, you little punk!
 You're the kind of smart alecklittle punk that I despise the most.
 Wait! You aren't thinking ofusing Crow, are you?!
 Kankuro, stop that.
 Huh?
 You're an embarrassmentto our village.
 G-Gaara...
 When did he get next to me?
 It's stealthy footstepson the level of Kakashi...
 There is no other reason tosummon you here other than…
 As I assume you already understand,
 based on the facesyou can see around...
 So it's already that time...
 The other Lands have alreadybeen notified, right?
 I've seen them here and therein the village.
 And, when will it be?
 In a week...
 That's very sudden.
 Now… I will make theformal announcement.
 Seven days from today…
 On the first day of July,the Chunin Exam will begin!
 Yes, yes, yes!
 It's the Chunin Exam,it's the Chunin Exam!
 If I were to win first place or something,becoming a Hokage would be closer!
 There's no way I can lose!
 Konohamaru, you think so too, right?
 What?
 Who the heck snatched up Moegi,and what 're you gonna do?
 Stop, I won't let you get away!
 Next time: ""Identify Yourself: Powerful New Rivals""
 As for me, I'm gonna kick butt again!

 Mystery of the Targeted Merchants
 Did they really come this way?
 But why come this way?
 They shouldn’t come this wayif it’s as you say, Choji.
 I said that because I didn’t thinkwe were being targeted.
 I don’t think this isthe time to argue…
 We have to formulatesome sort of strategy.
 You say that, but…
 What is it?
 Have the guysyou spoke of caught up?
 Then we should divide upthis group in two.
 Here it’s hard enoughto protect one.
 What’s the point of dividing the group in two?
 N-Naruto!
 Please, tell us what your idea is.
 This is what I mean.
 For example…
 Let’s say there are ten persimmons here.
 Is anything okayif it’s a food?
 Yeah.
 Then I want it to be ramen!
 Naruto, it’s an example, so…
 Then we’ll make it ramen.
 Someone is afterthese ten bowls of ramen.
 And there are three people to protect the ramen.
 And so one person hasto protect roughly three bowls.
 No, no. If it’s ramen,
 we should just eat it allbefore they come.
 That would settle things.
 N-Naruto. This ramen isfor delivery to someone,
 so we can’t eat it.
 Really? But the ramenwon’t be tasty if it gets soggy.
 I’m moving on.
 If three people protectten bowls of ramen,
 one person protectsabout three bowls.
 But this ramen haslegs for escaping.
 Ramen with legs for escaping?!
 Five bowls of ramenquick to escape…
 and five bowls of ramenslow to escape.
 Right, right..Things are kind of getting crazy.
 I see. If we divide theminto two groups…
 Of course, the pursuers would targetthe group that is slow to escape first.
 So we have one person defend the preceding group
 and two peoplefor the group that is slow to escape.
 Right, right.
 By doing this, as for protecting the slow group,
 now one person can just protecttwo and a half bowls.
 Oh!
 In other words, the ramen that arequick to escape are the young people
 and the ramen that are slow to escapeare the elderly people and children, right?
 Exactly.Not only will the possibility of
 the former to completelyget away increase,
 the burden on the latterto protect will decrease.
 It’s a strategy that kills two birds with one stone.
 You’re smart.
 However…the elderly people and children will…
 I just stated a rational idea.
 There’s the possibility
 of complete annihilationif we stay in a group.
 Am I wrong, Yurinoshin?
 Well…
 Then it’s settled.Let’s divide everyone up in two.
 I’m sorry, gramps.
 Don’t worry about it.
 It would be trouble if something badwere to happen to the men in their prime.
 You’ve got a wife and kidat home, right?
 Then we’ll be going onahead first, Naruto, Choji.
 Right.We’re counting on you, Hinata.
 Naruto and I will dealwith the pursuers.
 Right.I’ll protect them well.
 Lady Haruna.
 Yurinoshin, keep your mouth shut.What’s your mission?
 Is it not to protect me?
 Things will be settled if Kikusukedefeats those guys.
 Then shall we get going, too?
 I’m counting on you, Brother Choji.
 Right! 					Leave it to me!
 Choji.
 You go on ahead.
 What?
 I’m going back to check things outat the place where the traps are.
 But if you do that, you may encounter the pursuers along the way…
 That’s fine.
 Doing something like waiting to be attacked isn’t my style!
 Naruto!
 Leave it to me!
 I meant…
 There’s no point to our strategy
 if I have to protect five people by myself.
 Right, there’s no point.
 We came down that path,
 so the trap should beup ahead somewhere.
 I guess I’ll take a shortcut!
 What’s this? 					What happened?
 Why is it so wet?
 What’re these wounds?!
 This guy’s…!
 Are you serious?
 Is something wrong, Brother Choji?
 No, nothing.
 I see…
 I feel it.
 Even I can sense this much bloodlust.
 It’s close now.
 Huh?
 Rain?
 This is the worst. Rain wipes outall presence of the enemy.
 Oh…
 This rain is weird.
 Gather around, everyone!
 Stay close to me.
 What’s…this?
 This is bad!
 What was that now?!
 Everyone! Get under the cart!
 We’re already under here!
 You’re quick!
 Choji!
 Naruto!
 Get down!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto! Could you say soat the start
 if you’re going touse paper bombs?
 All right. It seems they’re gone.
 Why did they disappear?
 Isn’t it obvious?
 They have no business with a shopthat doesn’t have the thing they want.
 Thing they want?
 That’s right.
 If a shop’s sold outof the item you want,
 you’d go to another shop, right?
 Could it be that the thing that he wantsis in the other group?
 What does that mean?!
 Hinata’s in danger!
 Everyone, leave your stuff hereand take only what you need!
 Hinata is?!
 Everyone, we’ll put up our tents here for today and rest.
 It’s dangerous to move in the dark.
 Hey!
 We finally caught up.
 Naruto, Choji. What is it?
 “What is it,” nothing.The situation has changed.
 It seems someone amongthese people
 is hiding something important.
 Something important?
 It should probably have somethingto do with us being chased.
 But who is hiding what?
 It’s most likely you guys,Shun and Yurinoshin.
 Don’t be silly!What’re you saying we’re hiding?
 Don’t play innocent!
 Kikusuke has been killedby someone!
 What?!
 Kikusuke was?!
 Don’t play innocent!
 Kikusuke has been killedby someone!
 What?!
 Kikusuke was?!
 Why should he have tosuit up like a Shinobi,
 fight those guys and then get killed?!
 It’s not necessary to tell you guys.
 But if that’s why we’re being chased…
 It means you guys are puttingeveryone in danger.
 If you don’t tell us honestly,
 we won’t be able to protect even what we can protect.
 Kikunojou…
 Kikunojou?
 You mean Kikusuke?
 Yes… And my name isn’t Yurinoshin. It’s Yurinojou.
 Stop, Yurinojou!
 The person here is Lady Haruna,
 the only daughter of the feudal lordof the Land of Greens.
 Princess?!
 Princess Haruna of the Land of Greens.You’ve grown up so much…
 P-Princess…?
 You were a woman?!
 Lady Haruna,it is as these people say.
 We must not put everyone in dangerby hiding the truth any further.
 But why is someone like a princess mingling among merchants?
 There was information ofa coup in the Land of Greens.
 A coup?
 The Land of Greens was a small,but calm and peaceful land.
 However, it was by no meansa prosperous land.
 Before we realized it,
 more than half of the public officials had been bought off.
 Who in the world would do that…?
 The ringleaders are three brotherscalled the Janin,
 evil Ninja who came from across the sea.
 Janin?
 Yes. They’re guys who usea particular type of Ninjutsu
 and are called as suchbecause of their frightfulness.
 They’ve taken many livesand think nothing of it
 if it’s for their own gains.
 They treat people like worms…
 But why the Land of Greens?
 I don’t know why.
 But his lordship had Lady Harunahide amongst a group of merchants
 and got her out of the land.
 Kikunojou and I were leftwith the protection of the princess,
 but we were insecure withjust the two of us.
 So then we hurriedly commissionedthe Hidden Leaf
 under the pretext of protectionfrom bandits.
 Why didn’t you tell us something that important?
 There’s no way I could have.My escape is top secret.
 Besides, what would happen if I were to have told you?
 The end result would’ve been you guys running away in confusion.
 No way would I do something like run away.
 Kikunojou might not havehad to die if
 we had understood the situation from the start.
 I wonder.
 One of you guys might’ve ended uplike Kikunojou.
 We’re actually fine.
 But to think you’d go so far as to involvethe old lady and the children.
 It couldn’t be!
 Were you intending to use the old lady and the kids as decoys
 and escape just yourself?!
 That’s right. What of it?
 Choji! Hinata!
 As for me,I’m really tickedoff right now!
 So what of it?!
 If something should happen in the land,
 I would becomethe only blood relative
 of the feudal lord of the Land of Greens.
 If I can just survive,things could be restored someday,
 even if the Land of Greenswere to be destroyed.
 Say what?! Just what is ityou think of people’s lives?!
 Please forgive her.
 Yurinojou.
 Is it not your mission to protect me?
 You’re still talking about such things…?
 Please wait, Naruto!
 Lady Haruna, that’s true for me.
 However, these people are different.
 The mission they undertookwas to protect merchants.
 It was not to protect us.
 Indeed, what we heard about
 was a D-rank mission to protectall of the merchants.
 Protecting a prominent figure ofa land is an A-rank mission.
 The rank differs by far too much.
 Are you guys sayingyou’re going to forsake me?
 Weren’t you saying until just now
 that you didn’t trust people like us?
 I’ll protect you with my life,Lady Haruna…
 Shut up, Yurinojou!Kikunojou was your senior disciple.
 There’s no way you alonecould defeat an opponent
 whom he couldn’t defeat!
 That will just be our destinywhen that happens, Lady Haruna.
 Watch, Brother Choji.
 Oh! Awesome, awesome.
 I’m sorry about earlier.
 It happened so suddenly,I couldn’t stop.
 Don’t be concerned about me.
 However, please forgive Lady Haruna.
 The Land of Greens is a small land.
 For the sake of the land’s survival,
 Lady Haruna was kept under the custody of another land,
 as a hostage all by herselfsince she was little.
 Hostage?
 It frequently happens ina small land in a war-torn world.
 When Lady Haruna returned from the other land,
 she had completely lost her feelingsof trust towards people.
 Lady Haruna is alsoa victim of a turbulent world.
 There’s a village
 about one league down the mountain from here.
 For the time being,
 we’ll leave the old woman and the others there.
 Be careful now.
 You guys, too!
 Bye!
 Why are you separating them from us?
 They still have value formy personal use.
 Are you still going on about that?
 They went so far as to discard their merchandise for your sake.
 Then we should also leave this place.
 We must not.
 If we go into hiding,
 there’s a possibility ofthat group being attacked again.
 Exactly. This time,it’s our turn to be the decoy
 in order to protect them.
 Do as you like!
 Hinata, I’ll take care of things here.Please rest a while.
 Yeah, do that.
 Th-Then, if you insist.
 Oh, yeah. Here.Kikunojou was holding this.
 Thanks, Naruto.
 Kikunojou was a masterof the Flower Ninjutsu
 passed down in the Land of Greens.
 We learned together when we were little
 and I couldn’t beat him even once…
 Now I have forever lost the chance to beat him.
 No… You still have a chance.
 What?
 If you beat the guywho defeated Kikunojou,
 you will have beaten Kikunojou!
 Naruto… You’re exactly right…!
 Here they come!
 Other than the fact thatthe enemy uses water,
 we have absolutely no ideawhat they’ll come at us with.
 I know.
 Go! Flower Ninja Art:!Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage.
 What?!
 He changed the trajectory in mid-air?!
 Oh, no!
 I finally got you!
 Gotcha.
 To think you’dmake me look like a fool.
 So you finally show yourself.
 I will avenge Kikunojou!
 Try it if you can.
 I won’t let you get away!
 Too bad. You’re one person short.
 I’ve set a share for one more.
 I don’t know about that.
 First, I’ll take care of you, boy.
 Water Style: Liquid Memory!
 Naruto…!
 And this!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What is it?
 Is that…?
 The Jutsu that killed Kikunojou?!
 Vanish and die!

 I don’t wanna become its food.
 Let me tell you one thing.I’m not tasty.
 I’m not tasty, either.
 But Choji would be moreworthwhile to eat.
 No, Naruto would be tastier.
 Be eaten for the sake of your comrade.
 You’re the one who willbecome it food.
 This isn’t the time to be arguing about stuff like that.

 Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka
 At this point in time,
 I don’t even plan to fightover Sasuke with you.
 Sakura!
 Do you know whoyou’re lipping off to?!
 Don’t press your luck,crybaby Sakura!
 It seems like...it seems like Sakura was out of line!
 Ino’s eyes show incredible anger.She’s scary.
 Hmm.
 That's not it…
 Huh?
 Sakura’s not the kind of kidto do things
 like needlessly flaunt herown power and hurt people.
 She doesn’t like having Inotaking pity on her and pulling punches.
 – This time for sure,– This time for sure,
 – with full strength,– with full strength,
 – a fair... fight!– a fair... fight!
 The Ultimate Battle: Cha!
 Just a Clone Jutsu…?!
 This isn’t a Ninja Academy’sgraduation exam!
 You think you can beat me…
 with a textbook ninja art?!
 If I look carefully, I can find out,which is the real one right away…
 Chakra to my feet at a burst…Then…
 repel off the ground!
 Fast!
 If you think I’m the crybaby SakuraI was until recently,
 you’ll get your fingers burned!
 Come like you mean it, Ino!
 I appreciate you saying that…
 I’ll go like I mean it, as you wish!
 Way to go Sakura!
 Great!
 Really great!
 With the fundamental movementsusing Chakra,
 she’s topnotch among the rookies…
 Huh?
 Sakura is at her best.
 That means…ls she better than me?
 Well!
 That’s right.
 Awww!
 Sending Chakra all throughoutthe body and
 using the techniquewith it at a right timing…
 Those techniques aloneare better than Sasuke.
 Well, from the start,she was extremely good at…
 controlling her Chakra, so…
 Magnificent movements, Sakura!
 However, her opponent is good too.
 This evenly-matched battlelooks to take awhile!
 Since when did this girlget this strong?!
 I can make it, too…!
 You little…!
 Whoa!
 At this rate, it’ll never end.
 This is long…
 They’ve been going at itfor ten minutes, at the least.
 You shouldn’t be evenlymatched with me!
 What makes you thinkI’m evenly matched with you…
 who’s only concerned with looksand growing your hair frivolously?!
 You!
 You carry your mockingof me too far!
 Idiot.
 She’s going for the bait.
 Who knows what Ino will do!
 I don’t like Ino when she’s that way…!
 You’re simple-minded…
 Uh-oh.
 She’s totally lost it!
 I don’t need this!
 S-Scary…
 I’ll put an end to this right now!
 I’ll make you say that you lost!
 Hey, don’t tell me…
 Could it be…?
 As I recall, that Sign is…
 I knew it…
 She’s planning to dothe Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 Man…That idiot!
 I understand your feelings of frustration,but that’s futile.
 Humph!
 I wonder!
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu…
 A Jutsu where the user can takeover the opponent’s spirit
 and wrest their body awayfor a few minutes…
 by discharging all oftheir own spiritual energy
 and striking the enemy with it.
 But, there are major flawsto this formidable Jutsu.
 First, the discharged spiritual energycan only fly straight and at a slow speed.
 Second, even in the case of failingto hit the enemy and missing,
 the user can’t return to herown body for several minutes.
 I should add that duringthat interval, the user’s,
 in other words, your main bodywill turn into a doll that won’t move at all!
 In the first place,
 the Mind Transfer Jutsu is usedfor spying and is not a Jutsu for battle.
 Ino, using that Jutsu herewould be equal to suicide…
 It shouldn’t be particularlyscary if she moves about…
 And not only that,if she dodges the Jutsu,
 she can beat the heck outof the non-moving opponent.
 If that happens, Hayate will be forcedto put an end to the match…
 So what?!
 I won’t know unless I try!
 If you miss, it’s over.
 You know that, right?
 In the first place,it’s a combination Jutsu to be used
 after stopping the opponent’smovements during a battle
 with my Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 There’s no way!
 There is no way, it will hit…
 Idiot! Stop!
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 Which one…?
 That was unfortunate…
 Ino.
 Has the fat lady sung…?
 She went and did it…
 Then, it’s over, eh.
 This is…?!
 You fell for it, Sakura!
 I finally caught you!
 It can't be!
 Yes, it can.
 My Sign weaving earlier was just an act,
 to drive you who was runningabout into this contrivance.
 So?
 You can’t move at all, can you?
 It’s special rope that’s my hairwith Chakra poured in!
 With this, it will be over whenI enter your body and say “give up!”
 It wouldn’t missa hundred percent of the time!
 I see…
 That idiot… Her losing itwas also an act?
 Get out of there, Sakura!
 I can’t move…!
 Then…
 Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 That was unfortunate…
 She missed!
 No!
 Sakura…
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 W-What’s with Ino?
 Also... Sakura’s acting kind of strange!Believe it!
 But…surely this is her chance!
 Do it, Sakura!
 It’s no use.
 To think, the Mind Transfer Jutsu there…
 Sakura’s had it.
 Mind Transfer…?!
 That means Sakura right now is…
 Yes.
 Sakura’s spirit has beencompletely taken over by Ino.
 What?!
 Ino is inside of Sakura’s body now!
 Well.
 Ino’s purpose is most likely…
 With this, it’s over.
 Good bye, Sakura…
 I…Sakura Haruno concede…
 – this match… 					– No!
 Sakura!
 Tsk!
 He’s annoying!
 You did your hardest to get here!
 You’ll disgrace women if you loseto that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
 Like I said, those wordsare useless…
 What's...
 this bad chill…?!
 Naruto is annoying!
 Anyway, that’s right…not to Ino I won’t …
 Sakura?!
 This can’t be happening…
 What’s the matter?
 Are you conceding?
 I won’t be conceding!
 No Way!
 Cha!
 Which is it?
 W-What’s going on?!
 Sakura…?!
 No way!
 I messed up my Jutsu…?
 Ino…You’ll have a terrible time of itif you don’t get out of me quick!
 What’s wrong, with Ino?
 No… I won’t hold on at this rate…
 Release!
 It can’t be…She shattered Ino’s Jutsu!
 She used too much energybefore the Jutsu…
 So she didn’t have enough Chakra…?!
 To think she has two spirits…What are you?!
 Strength that ranks with beauty.
 Girls can’t survive if they’re not tough!
 If caught in that spell,
 it’s not that easy to cast outthe invader…
 Ino’s lack of Chakra…
 There’s also that…
 But what was more effective than that…
 was the combative spirit towardslno she has inside her heart.
 So that was awakened with Naruto’s voiceas the trigger and she cast Ino out…?
 There’s nothing to it.
 Like Naruto…
 Sakura’s fighting spirit wasmuch stronger than others.
 – This is…! 					– This is…!
 But, both of them shouldhave hardly any Chakra left.
 – This is… 					– This is…
 – the end! 					– the end!
 Both parties are unableto continue the match!
 By double knockout,
 no one gets through thefourth battle of the preliminary!
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 Now then...
 Good grief.
 Hey, Ino!
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 A-A-Are you okay?!
 Treatment’s not necessary.
 They’ll probably wake up after awhile.
 But, that was surprising…
 Yeah…
 Naruto and Sasuke aside…
 to think even that Sakura who didn’thave what it took has grown this much…
 A lot happened,
 but I really feel like itwas a good thing…
 sending her to this Chunin Exam.
 Tenten vs. Temari
 Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
 Now…
 The second one from theLand of Sand, huh…
 – This looks to be an interesting match.– Do your best, Tenten!
 It looks like you finallywoke up, eh…Sakura.
 Huh?!
 Tenten, power of youth!
 Go Go!
 There is no limit to your youth!
 Our match is already over.
 Did I…lose?
 I’m the one who wants to cry…
 To think I tied with somebody like you…
 Huh?
 Here!
 You also got a flower to bloom, didn’t you?
 A beautiful flower!
 Ino…
 However...
 the next time we fight,
 it won’t end with yougetting knocked out!
 Hm…?!
 And… I won’t hand overSasuke to you!
 I return the same line to you!
 – Humph! 					– Humph!
 The fifth battle…
 Tenten, Temari…come forward!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 You know! You know!
 I feel like women battlesare incredible, or…
 Women are scary.
 Huh?
 Hey-hey!
 This isn’t the time to bewithdrawing, Shikamaru.
 You’re kind of a plain, or a lousy,or an unimpressive guy, aren’t you?
 If you don’t really put your whole heartinto it, things will get hairy for you.
 Next episode:“Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru”
 This is really, seriously bad!

 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 The Dark Creeping Clouds
 Come…come…come…
 The villagers are welcoming us.
 Everyone seems to be safe.
 It seems like the Kurosuki Familyran away in fear.
 Hey…
 Here they come!
 Naruto! Don’t come…
 If you value your life,be quiet.
 Karashi…
 I heard that you were deeply sorryfor your actions…!
 How could I shamelesslyrun back to the curry house?!
 Now!
 Did you see that?!
 Although Master Raiga is not around,the Kurosuki Family is eternal!
 Hey…what are you looking for?
 Isn’t it obvious? The brats!
 Are you referring to us?
 What?!
 What you crushed were our forms
 made by the Shadow Clone Jutsuand the Transformation Jutsu.
 Take formation!
 Ninja Art: Black Tornado!
 Wha--?
 Those were also made by
 the Shadow Clone Jutsuand the Transformation Jutsu!
 We saw through everything!
 Here I go.
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Disperse!
 Byakugan!
 2 palms! 4 palms!
 8 palms!
 16 palms!
 32 palms!
 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!

 Huh?! Oww…
 It’s already over…
 What?! Not fair!
 Man! You could’ve savedsome for me!
 Just when I thoughtI’d try the new Jutsu!
 Gosh, you never learn, do you!
 Karashi, are you prepared?
 I was just kidding!
 How dare you torment us!
 You really thinkwe’ll let this slide as a joke?
 I couldn’t help it! If I didn’t listen,
 I would have gotten killedby the Kurosuki family.
 In place of the Kurosuki family,
 I’ll crack your headwith this hammer!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 I’m sorry…
 Please move, Lee!
 Please hit me untilyou guys are satisfied.
 Why you?
 It’s partly my responsibility
 that the once kind-hearted Karashiwent and joined a gang.
 Yours?
 Because of me,
 he got the impressionthat power is everything.
 Right, that’s right!
 Though I knew that it’s a bad thing,I just had to…
 You be quiet!
 Karashi is still inexperienced.
 But he has skills to make currythat can save people’s lives.
 Please give Karashi the opportunityto make amends by making curry.
 If Karashi goes astray again,then I will…!
 Punish him with my fists!
 Everyone, what do you think
 about letting Lee and Grandma Sanshotake care of this situation…
 After all, he was justan underling of the Kurosuki family.
 It’s not like he directlyattacked us or anything…
 Let’s have Lee educate him harshly…
 In that case…
 Thank you very much!
 Th-Thank you…
 And with this, our mission is complete.
 No, not yet…
 Huh?
 Are you all right?
 What’s the point of being all right?
 I can’t live alone.
 Don’t say that!
 Why don’t we justleave this weakling!
 Everyone has to live alone!
 But don’t you need friendswho can help you and stuff…?
 I’m talking about some basics!I hate people who are indecisive!
 I was frailfrom the time I was born.
 That shabby cabin wasthe entire world for me.
 I have no memory of my parents…
 I survived only bythe small amount of food
 that the villagers sometimesbrought me…
 But even someone like mehad a power that no one else did.
 Here you go.
 Thank you…
 Is your leg okay?The one you cut with the scythe?
 D-Did I tell you that story?!
 No…I kind of found out…
 How? No one else besides mecame today or yesterday, right?
 No, I just saw it from here…
 Scary!
 As time went by everyone beganto fear me since I had the power
 to know what was happening outsideeven from my room.
 Did you know?!
 I heard that Ranmaru hasthe ability to see everything…
 Were we being spied on every day?
 Get out of the village!
 You monster!
 And so I had no more visitors…
 All I could do was to wait to die.
 That’s when Raiga saved me…
 I see. What a bitter past.
 Yes, it is.
 Hmm…
 Raiga took me out tothe unknown world.
 Ranmaru, try opening your eyes…
 This is the outside world wherewe’ll be living from now on…okay?
 Okay…
 If Raiga isn’t here,it’s the same as losing my body.131.01	01:36:52:09	01:36:54:13	Perhaps Raiga became known
 as one of the Seven Ninja SwordsMen of the Mist
 because he was ableto borrow your power.
 It seems like you twohelped each other to live…
 Yes.
 That’s not true!
 You were being used forRaiga’s evil deeds!
 I might have been…used…
 But good or bad doesn’t matter to me.I’m just a sense organ…
 Then that won’t meanthat you’re really living!
 Huh?
 See, you have to do your bestto live from now on!
 Firstly, eat the curry of lifeand cheer up!
 That’s right!You will get nourishment.
 That will hurt the body instead,wouldn’t it?
 Naruto, you can’t eat it either, right?
 Actually, the more I eat it,
 the more energized my body feels…
 That curry saved my life, you know!
 Until the day you’re ableto walk alone,
 I will become your body!
 Okay?
 I have one favor to ask…
 Huh…?
 Byakugan!
 As I expected…I can no longer see life in Raiga.
 Can you see, Ranmaru?
 Yes.
 Is this okay?
 Yes…
 Let’s go… Mission is complete.
 Hey!
 What?
 That is--!
 One, two, one, two.
 Grandma Sansho!
 What’s all this ruckus?!Dust will go into the curry.
 L-Lee and the others came back!
 K-Karashi is with them!
 Is it worth the ruckus?
 Grandma, aren’t you happy?
 One, two… One, two…
 Your snot will go in!
 Grandma Sansho! I’m back!
 Karashi is here too!
 M-Mom, sorry!Please forgive me!
 Please forgive him…
 He says he’ll devote himselffrom now on,
 and train to take overthe Curry of Life Shop, so please…
 First you gotta eat…
 Huh…
 Wow, it looks good!
 If you’re not going to eat, I will!
 I’ve prepared some for each of you…
 Oh my, that’s a very pale child.
 Yeah, can you preparesome for him too?
 Especially mild…
 I prefer mild too…
 Oh my…
 Mom…thanks for the food!
 It’s a punishment times 300 curry…
 It’s spicy, it’s spicy…
 But it’s good! It’s good, Mom!
 Here, I have some for everybody!
 It’s okay, it’s mild.
 By the way, you were part of
 the Seven Ninja SwordsMen of the Mist with Raiga, right?
 Do you know a guynamed Zabuza?
 Zabuza…you say?
 Uh then…
 How about a guy with this huge swordwrapped with something like a bandage
 and has fish eyes?
 Oh…that’s Kisame…
 Yeah Kisame!
 So, do you know whathe’s up to right now?
 No… I heard that he slipped outfrom the Mist Village.
 I know his face, but I don’t knowanything beyond that.
 I see…
 Should I ask Grandma tomake you something else?
 No, I don’t need it…I don’t want to eat anything.
 Thank you for your help…
 Thank you very much.
 Make a good village with everyone!
 Um…where is Lee?
 His mission still isn’t complete.
 Please wait, Lee… I’m gonna die!
 Okay, let’s take a break here!
 Let’s do 300 push ups.
 What?!
 One, two…One, two…
 300…all right.
 It looks like…there’s going to be a storm.
 Even if a real storm comes,
 it should be fine if we reinforce itwith these big trees!
 Oh my, thanks for doing this.
 No, it’s our thanks for the curry.
 Uh-uuh.
 But compared to you guys,my Karashi is…
 Tenten? I’m worried aboutKarashi and Ranmaru
 whom we left behindat the curry shop.
 We’re okay,so could you check on them there?
 Karashi?!
 Hey…
 Is the Boss really still alive?
 That Neji person didn’t seemto sense it then…
 But I know.
 Raiga…
 Oh…
 You were everything to me!
 I was only waiting to die…
 when you told me thatwe’ll live on together!
 To me, being with you, was living…
 I won’t hold a funeral for you either.
 Even if it costs me my life,I won’t let you die!
 Ranmaru!
 Did you die, Ranmaru?!
 Karashi…?
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 What?! Tenten fell off the cliff?!
 Then we gotta go save herright away!
 Please calm down! Naruto!
 Tenten can’t be that clumsy.
 Huh? But that’s what Karashi said.
 Unfortunately, this might besome kind of trap.
 What? Trap?
 Karashi…
 Well, didn’t they get annihilated?

 This man Jiraiya does not fall victimto any woman’s allurement,
 but rather his forte iswinning women’s affections!
 You were totally excited by a lame tacticlike a woman winking at you!
 You shouldn’t be the one to tryacting all suave and cool, you Pervy Sage!
 Like I said, don’t call methat in front of people…
 Be quiet…
 More importantly these peoplearen’t normal, Pervy Sage!
 Didja hear me, Pervy Sage?!
 Like I said, don’t call me “Pervy Sage”!
 You are, after all, Master Jiraiya,one of the legendary Sannin…
 I didn’t believe thatI’d be able to stop you so easily
 despite the fact that you area huge womanizer.
 What?!
 You know the true identityof Pervy Sage?!
 Well no, that’s not necessarilywho I really am…
 Seems like you released the Genjutsuthat we had put on that woman.
 You shouldn’t call yourself a manfor using such a cowardly tactic
 like casting a Genjutsu on the womanwith your hypnotic eyes
 to separate me and Naruto.
 Separate us…Why would they do that?
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 You are after the Nine-Tailed Foxin Naruto…
 No wonder Kakashi knew that as well…
 I see clearly now.The information source was you.
 To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priorityplaced by our organization, Akatsuki!
 What’s going on…?
 I can’t let you have Naruto…
 I wonder about that.
 This is perfect…I’ll get rid of you two right here!
 Don’t butt in…

 Me!
 Hate Among the Uchihas:The Last of the Clan
 Sasuke…
 Revenge, I see…
 Right now, I have no interest in you…
 Don’t mess with me!

 Darn you!
 Naruto! I told you not to butt in!
 I told you before…
 I’ve lived only for this very day…for this very day!
 Sasuke…
 Not yet…
 You can’t even make a hand signtogether at this point…
 This is…my battle!
 Fine.
 Wha--?
 You heard that didn’t you?
 This is their battle.Let’s not bother with it.
 Fine then!
 Wh-Why…?
 Our power difference hasn’t changedat all since that time…
 Why is that?
 He doesn’t show any mercy.
 What have I…been doing all this time?
 Whatever have I…
 You are weak.
 And you are weak…
 because you don’t have enough hate.
 This place is…
 This place is…Could it be?!
 That's right.
 This is our house.
 Dad! Mom!
 You are weak.
 For the next 24 hours…
 Stop it…
 Relive that day.
 Stop it!
 Uncle! Auntie!
 You’re not even worth killing.Foolish younger brother…
 If you want to kill me, begrudge me!Hate me!
 And keep on surviving in thatunsightly manner…
 Just continue fleeing and fleeingand hang onto your life!
 Hasn’t changed at all…
 Using Tsukiyomi: Nightmare Realmon your own little brother.
 Stop it already! You!
 Wha--?!
 Th-This…
 Ninja Art: Toad Mouth Trap!
 How unfortunate, Itachi, Kisame.
 You guys are already insidemy stomach!
 I summoned the esophagus ofthe giant toad
 of the Mt. Myomoku rock cave.
 You guys are wanted criminals anyway.
 I’ll turn you guys into fodderfor the stone toad.
 What?!
 Wh-What is this?
 Naruto, you stay still!
 Don’t worry, it’s my Jutsu!
 Come here, Kisame!
 Oh!
 Darn it!
 It’s useless!
 There hasn’t been one person whohas been able to escape from this!
 A wall of flesh is charging at us!
 The wall is faster.
 At this rate…
 Hey…
 Pervy Sage!
 What’s the matter?!
 Huh!
 They’ve gone!
 I cannot believe that this wallhas been torn through…
 Why must we retreat?You would be…
 We have no reason to rush toget Naruto in the current condition.
 Besides, I have to restmy body somewhere for a while.
 Not just Tsukuyomi,
 but he also made meuse Amaterasu as well…
 What is this fire?
 It’s black…
 Don’t get so close!
 How did those guys manage to get out?
 Not only that…
 What are these black flames?
 The stone toad who has the abilityto blow fire had its intestine’s burned…
 Huh…?
 All right!
 Sealing Jutsu: Fire Seal!
 All right! It’ll be okay for now.
 Now for Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke…
 Dynamic…
 Guy?!
 Entry!
 Well… Eh…
 I’m sorry to have kicked you so directly.
 I was in a rush and I forgot my mirror…
 I used this headband instead,but it was hard to see.
 And I assumed this rough-hewn facewas the enemy…
 I just let the flames ofthe burning juvenescence take over me…
 I’m sorry!
 Is that … supposed to be an apology?
 I’m a simple-minded guyjust like how my face looks.
 It doesn’t really matter.
 More importantly, we have to get Sasuketo the Medical Team!
 Yes!
 He’s broken his arm and ribs.
 Not only that, he’s lost consciousness
 from some kind of mental blowhe received from the Visual Jutsu!
 This boy also experienced that Jutsu…
 Hey Pervy Sage!ls Sasuke going to be all right?
 Seems like he’s receiveda significant amount of mental damage.
 I’m going to kill you!
 Die!
 You jerk!
 You’re in the way!
 Darn… Why?!
 What did that guy do to Sasuke?!
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 We’ve gotta change our plan!
 I got scared earlier,
 but this time I’m going to chasethose black-capes and get them!
 It’s me that they want, right?!
 Then, I’ll be the one tomake my way over!
 Humph, you’re only going to be killedif you go now.
 They’re at a totally different levelfrom you.
 I just managed to get youaway from them…
 Then, are we just goingto keep running away?!
 Are we supposed to keep living in fear?!
 Shut your mouth for a second!
 You are weak.
 I’m sorry, Guy.
 I thought that I had sparedthe boy’s feeling, but…
 I should have saved him much sooner.
 Kakashi has also come downwith the same Jutsu…
 We don’t know whenhe will regain consciousness.
 Kakashi Sensei?!
 When my students are hurt…
 I always wish,from the bottom of my heart…
 If that person,who is a medical specialist, were here…
 That’s why we’re going togo find her now.
 What?
 You mean, her?
 Could it be…?
 W-Wait…!
 C-Could this money be…?!
 Yup, that’s right…
 The one who uses the slugand drives illness away,
 and who is alsoone of the Sannin like me…
 All right! We’re going to turn aroundour luck with this!
 Princess Tsunade withthe letter “Gamble” on her back!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools
 It’s festival, festival, festival!
 I’m going to spend likethere’s no tomorrow!
 Wait a minute, Naruto!I will keep your wallet for you.
 Huh?!
 It’s been said since ages pastthat three forbidden factors:
 money, alcohol, and women,are believed to cause Ninja failures.
 I am not like you, Pervy Sage!
 All right! I am going toenjoy the festival!

 Darn, that bastard!
 Naruto, Sasuke…
 Take this.
 Sakura… What's that?
 Before leaving the Leaf Village,
 Lady Tsunade handed this to me.
 Take this with you.I am sure it will come in handy.
 Old Lady Tsunade?
 I think he’ll recoverconsciousness now.
 Sasuke and Naruto,you take this, too.
 O-Okay.
 Also, we’ll be too cold here,so we need to move somewhere else.
 Brother!
 Look! I’ve finally becomea Ninja, too!
 I see…
 I’ve got to become the bestin everything!
 I’ll train hard,and complete lots of missions.
 And I’ll become a Chunin super fast.
 Then after that, a Jonin.
 I’m going to be like you, Brother!
 I’m Idate, the Swift Runnermaking headway in life.
 Brother?
 Listen Idate…
 In the world of Shinobi,
 there is something more importantthan success or power.
 Something more important?
 Until you understand that,it’s too early for you to talk that way.
 Oh!
 He’s conscious now.
 Are you okay?
 What happened to Aoi?!
 He disappeared…
 So that Rain Ninja is called Aoi?
 Idate, do you know him?
 He…
 was a teacher whenI was in the Leaf Village.
 You…are from the Leaf Village?
 Aoi…betrayed the Leaf Village
 and became a Jonin of the Hidden Rain.
 What the hell do you mean?
 Not yet.
 You have to rest a little more.
 How is your hand there?
 That hand…
 You kept it clenched all this time.
 Darn! I’d come all this way,and yet I…!
 It’s too early to give up!
 And you tell us that you were oncea Shinobi of the Leaf?!
 I forgot all about the Leaf…
 the momentI walked away from the village.
 You walked away from the village?
 I was depressed after failingthe first test of the Chunin Exam.
 That was close, Idate…
 Don’t take it so hard.
 There are ways to becomea Chunin other than the Chunin Exam.
 Really?!
 Yes, really.
 Just do as I tell you.
 Okay!
 Aoi Sensei…
 Idate…
 Aoi Sensei,I’d brought them as you told me to.
 All right.
 These are indeed the Scroll of Sealingand the legendary blade,
 the Blade of the Thunder God, believed tohave been used by the Second Hokage.
 Well done, Idate.
 Now I can become a Chunin, right?
 Sure you can…
 in the Village Hidden in the Rain.
 You are leavingthe Leaf together with me,
 taking these as gifts to them.
 But…
 Of course.
 There's no way you can get away withstealing the village’s treasures.
 You tricked me!
 To survive in this world,you must not believe in others…
 Remember that.
 Well, what are you going to do, Idate?
 Either way, you are alreadya Rogue Ninja.
 You’ll be chained in jail for life,if you are lucky.
 You’ll be chained in jail for life,if you are lucky.
 Ever since then,I haven’t returned to the village.
 I am an irresponsible manwho can’t do a single thing right.
 But Boss Jirocho believed in me.
 Even though I'd neverbeen of any use to him.
 Boss Jirocho had faith in me!
 And yet, I…!
 He’s…
 He’s…like the old me…
 No one will ever accept you!Die Naruto!
 Duck down, Naruto!
 I’m…a worthless guy…
 W-Why?
 Because we are the same.
 He’s like me of the old days.
 I go around and around,and get nowhere…
 I can’t do anything right.
 Aoi is right.
 I have…no right to live--
 You idiot!
 There’s a personwho still trusts you, right?
 I know, Naruto.
 You felt alone…and you were suffering!
 One is enough!
 The race isn’t over yet!
 You never know how things will turn outunless you try until the very end.
 But…
 Stand up now!
 Naruto, it’s not possible!ldate’s body is still…
 If he can’t run,then I’ll carry him on my back and run!
 The opponent must already bein Modoroki Shrine…
 Don’t give up!
 Hey… Naruto…
 Sasuke…
 Let’s leave it to Naruto here.
 Jirocho is waiting for you, right?
 Pull yourself together!
 Boss, don’t you thinkhe actually ran away?
 He’ll come.
 I believe in Idate!
 If you run away now,you’ll be a loser for your entire life!
 For the people who believein you and wait for you…
 It’s the fastest boat around here.
 I'm grateful.
 No problem.
 Edged tools aren’tfor hurting people…
 Show them what you’ve got!
 Naruto! Please take me there!
 All right. Leave it to me!

 Why did you stopall of a sudden?!

 It smells like Sasuke ischasing those two people…
 What?!
 Sasuke is?
 There are no other signsof movement.
 But…
 Let’s not just stand around.Let’s go after Sasuke right away!
 But…what?
 The people who are left are goingto fight each other.
 We’ll end up taking a little longer way…
 but all there is for us to dois to avoid it.
 Why?! If we do that, it’ll only delay ourcatching up to Sasuke.
 Let’s just speed on through!
 What are you saying, Naruto?!
 We don’t know what’ll happenin the battle zone!
 Even if we don't desire it,
 there’s a possibility thatwe’ll be irrepressibly caught up in a battle.
 That doesn’t have anythingto do with it!
 Kid! Our mission is to bringSasuke back.
 So the cardinal rule is to avoid battleas much as possible until then!
 – Let’s go! 					– Got it!
 Fine!

 I’m from the Aburame Clanof the Leaf Village…
 When we fight,we never underestimate our opponent,
 no matter what puny insectsthey may be.
 I’ll advance with full force!
 Bring it!
 Put me down, Temari.
 Can you move, Gaara?
 Gaara!
 Kankuro is delaying Uchiha now.
 We must use this opening…
 If we don’t get a move on,the operation will…
 Huh?!
 Temari, go over there.
 What?
 Just beat it! You’re in the way!
 Astonishing Truth!Gaara’s Identity Emerges!
 Poison on the blade!
 I won’t let you get away!
 That’s… Sasuke Uchiha!Did he get past Kankuro?!
 No… No matter how you look at it,it’s too soon.
 Did another assailant come?
 I don’t know what you Sand Ninjaare scheming…
 but I’ll stop you!
 And…
 I’ll ascertain your true identity!
 Gaara!
 Don’t tell me…!
 Is he going to rouse that thingin a place like this?!
 This is no joke…lt’s out of my hands.
 Stop, Gaara!Have you forgotten the operation?!
 You who are strong…You who are called Uchiha…
 You who have friends…
 You who have a purpose…
 You who are like…me!
 By killing you…
 I will exist in this world asthe one who destroyed all of that…
 I can truly experience “life.”
 What is it?
 It’s so obvious if you releasesuch a blood-thirsty aura…
 Come on out.
 So it’s you, eh…
 What’s your purpose?Why do you seek power?
 It ‘s none of your business.
 Beat it!You’re a hindrance to my training.
 You…
 have the same eyes as I do.
 Eyes that seek power,brimming with hate and murderous intent.
 You’re like me.
 Don’t forget… You’re my…
 You’re…
 my…
 You're…my…
 my prey!
 It’s started…!
 A Substitution?!
 You’re naive.
 All right!
 Insects?!
 To think you’d makea clone out of insects and
 wrap around behind me…
 Not bad!
 Your reach encompasses from mediumto long distance and you use a puppet.
 I didn't think you woulddo well in close combat.
 With that Puppet Master Jutsuwhere you have to concentrate
 on the control of the puppet…
 the one casting the Jutsu isprone to openings in defense.
 You’re very aware of the weaknessof a puppet master!
 However, from here on,
 I’ll show you the essence ofthis Ninjutsu fighting style!
 The real terror of Crow…my puppet of warfare!
 This is Poison Smoke Bomb!
 Did I inhale…a little bit?
 I get it…And the caster of the Jutsu hides, eh?
 Listen, everyone…
 Even if enemy Shinobi appear,don’t panic.
 Go into the hidden room quickly.
 Your Jonin and Chunin Senseiswill protect you all with their lives!
 Oh!
 Konohamaru…
 It’ll be okay!
 Everyone’s doing their best.
 They can drive awaythe enemies right away.

 Grandpa…
 To have come this far…To have come this far…!
 Do I already lack the powerto drag out his soul?
 With this feeble body…
 even though I’m prepared to die,is it not enough…?!
 You probably could’ve killed meif you’d been ten years younger.
 Sarutobi! If you don’t kill him now,the village is doomed!
 Do you understand?!
 I…understand!
 Useless…old man…
 Now…Let me feel it!
 That eye!
 That eye…from before!
 This doesn’t look like it’ll endby the time you come for back-up…
 Shino…
 It looks like the poison hasslowly started to circulate.
 I’ll finish this!
 Insects, again?!
 But he shouldn’t be able tomove so much in that state…
 I’ll make things easier for you…
 Hey! What’s wrong?!
 What’s happening…?
 Don’t tell me…!
 It’s futile…He can’t move anymore…
 I had the beetles burrowinto every joint…
 He stuffed beetles into its jointsso that the puppet can’t move?
 That was his aim from the beginning!
 The beetles are passing throughthe threads of my Chakra…
 Why…?
 That’s it!As I recall, their food is Chakra.
 At this rate,my location will be found out!
 He cut the Chakra threads himself…?
 You got careless!
 Instantly reattaching the Chakra threadsthat have once been cut
 is simple for a first-rate puppet master.
 And…
 Crow is a puppet…
 that has a weapon in eachand every component of the body!
 It’s a big mistake if you thinkthis has ended…
 by your stopping my movements!
 There’s lots of poisonon the tip of the needle…
 Die!
 What?!
 Just like that, the insects…!
 The Chakra threads have beenbitten through!
 What?! Why…?!
 Where did these insectsspring out from?!
 By beating away the bait insectsalong the Chakra threads,
 you dropped your guard.
 You didn’t notice…the wriggling insects behind you.
 The insects were movingthe whole time…
 heading for your headband.
 W-What did you say?!
 The one blow earlier…
 I pretended to miss andstuck one of those beetles on you.
 But how did you know where I waswith one such beetle…?
 I…hate explaining the same thing twice.
 Shino? 					Why are you here?!
 I put a female beetle on youbefore you left the arena!
 The females have almost no smell…
 Only a male can sniff outthe subtle smell of the female.
 Then, this one beetle on my forehead…
 Right… It’s a female.
 The poison has circulatedthrough my whole body, huh…
 It looks like I won’t be ableto go to back you up…
 I’m sorry, Sasuke Uchiha.
 Is he a…monster?
 Are you scared of me, Sasuke Uchiha?!
 Of my existence?!
 Come out… 					Sasuke Uchiha!
 You’re…my…
 prey!

 The Cursed Warrior
 Old man’s…snot!
 I just can’t get myself intotraining doing it alone…
 I wonder if we won’t get a missionconnected to Sasuke or something.
 The Land of Birds?From such a remote land…
 That’s what’s troubling us.
 The “Cursed Warrior” apparition has beendisturbing the castle town
 and misleading the public, huh?
 So they want us to exterminate a ghost?
 I declined once sayingwe can’t go so far
 as to accept the exterminationof a ghost, but…
 I must have you accept this at any cost.Please accept!
 Is it because the money isn’t enough?
 We in the Land of Birds areexperiencing financial difficulties.
 Even this is the very limitthe budget will allow…
 It’s not an issue of money.
 In other words,it’s the mission details.
 Be that as it may,
 indeed there isn’t even enough tocover travel expenses with this amount…
 Now that things have cometo this pass…
 I shall commit harakiri…!
 Don’t be hasty!
 Yikes!
 It’s the little bit of pocket moneyI have saved up.
 I’ll pay out of my own pocket.So with this, please…!
 And that’s why you accepted it?
 It’s indulgent even for me…
 Nonetheless, most of theJonin and Chunin are out on missions.
 I was thinking of how to handle this…
 I guess someone’s talking about you.
 Everyone’s busy with missions,so they don’t have time for such things.
 Who’s that guy…?
 He’s been like that since earlier.
 Even tasty ramen won’t go down the throatright being watched like that!
 Come inside and eat if you’re hungry!
 No, I’m not hungry…
 So? Tasty, huh?
 Yes!
 Thanks for your business.
 Come back and have Narutotreat you again…
 Again and again like that?Give me a break.
 Thank you for treating me.ln appreciation…
 N-No, you don’t need to worry about it…
 But hey, what’s your name?
 You’re not a familiar facefrom this village…
 Yes, my name is Chishima andI have come from the Land of Birds.
 I came to the Village Hidden inthe Leaves to commission a mission…
 You’re flat broke even thoughyou came as a messenger of your land?
 There wasn’t enough moneyfor the commission,
 so I even used upmy own pocket money…
 Then it must bea very important mission, huh?
 It might even cost an important friendof mine’s very life…
 Your friend…?What the heck do you mean?
 Ever since I was little,
 I was raised like a brother with Lord Sagi,the feudal lord of the Land of Birds…
 You’re friends with a feudal lord?!
 I said feudal lord,
 but he was only just appointed last yearand actually he’s the same age as me.
 No kidding?Then he’s a totally young feudal lord.
 Y-Yes… The previous feudal lord,his father Lord Owashi died from illness
 and after that he even lost his twin sister…
 Ever since then,
 Lord Sagi, who was so cheerful,has become a totally different person…
 He wouldn’t show his faceeven if I visited…
 I’m worried about him asa friend rather than a feudal lord.
 I was thinking something mighthave happened to him…
 So if there is somethingI can do,
 I want to do whatever I can,as a friend…
 I couldn’t…save Sasuke.But this guy’s still…
 Leave it to me.
 What?
 Let’s save your friend!
 Right!
 Old Lady Tsunade! You’re mean!
 Listen, you could at least knockwhen entering my office.
 More importantly! What do you meanby fleecing bro of his pocket money
 and then not accepting the mission?!
 Huh?
 People call stuff like that devilish!You old lady devil!
 Try saying that again!
 I’m sorry!
 I wonder if Naruto…is okay…
 He’ll be fine.
 You’ve gotten to know a good guy…
 He may not look it,but he’s quite dependable.
 What?!
 R-Right…
 Who said I wouldn’t accept the mission?
 Oh, I see. So you were waiting for Nejito finish his mission and come back.
 Half-cocked jerk.
 Lee is on a mission with Guy.
 You and Tenten will form a three-man teamwith Neji as the leader, got it?
 Then did you hear from that kidabout the mission details?
 Well actually, not yet…
 It’s the extermination of a ghost.
 A ghost?
 It seems that it appears whenyou’re walking through town at night…
 A ghost clad in white armor.
 That’s what you’ll…
 I-I didn’t hear anything about a ghost…
 Are you scared of it?
 I’m not scared. I couldn’t be a Ninjaif I got scared at stuff like that!
 But does Ninjutsu work on ghosts?
 Who knows…?
 Try testing it out yourself.
 Jeez, why didn’t you say at the start
 that it was a commissionto exterminate a ghost?!
 I didn’t tell you?
 Not even a word.But that’s just a rumor anyway, right?
 I haven’t seen it, but…
 See?
 But it seems my master,Lord Moso, saw it close up.
 F-For real?!
 The Land of Birds, huh…?That’s sure far…
 Village Hidden in the Leaves
 Land of Birds
 Umm, is there more…?
 You sure eat a lot consideringyou’re thin.
 I’m sorry. I’m often calleda skinny voracious eater.
 Hey, by the way, is there really sucha thing as the Cursed Warrior?
 There are people who say
 it’s the disembodied spirit ofthe previous feudal lord, Lord Owashi.
 The disembodied spirit ofa dead feudal lord…
 Rather than ghosts,
 tell us a little more aboutthe Land of Birds.
 Sure…
 The capitol of the Land of Birdsstretches across the banks of the lake
 where migratory birds rest…
 It was a peaceful town withlots of green
 and where water from the lake wouldbe drawn into the canals…
 However, after the sudden death ofthe previous feudal lord,
 there was much uproar.
 His son Lord Sagi and Lord Komei,the tactician from previously,
 were nominated to bethe next feudal lord…
 But Lord Komei thought Lord Sagiwas still too young
 and was vehemently opposedto him assuming the feudal lordship.
 But in the end, Lord Sagitook the seat of feudal lord
 and the matter was closedwith Moso the high priest
 providing tutelage asa superintendent official…
 However, before even halfa year passed,
 Lady Toki, his twin sister,died suddenly…
 After that, Lord Sagiwho was so cheerful
 turned into a totally different person,became coldhearted
 and he now conducts governmentalmatters confined in his mansion…
 From about that time,
 the “Cursed Warrior” began appearingin the castle town…
 Those in the castle town saythat Lord Owashi was killed by someone…
 There are even those who saythat the Cursed Warrior
 is the ghost of Lord Owashisearching for the person
 who drove him to death and is attemptingto have his revenge…
 That’s scary…
 There’s no such thing as ghosts.
 But…
 That priest Moso is the one
 who gained the mostfrom Owashi’s death, huh…?
 Lord Moso is a magnificent personof virtue with no self-interests!
 Then the suspicious one is…
 The only one left is Komei the tactician!
 I bet he assassinated Owashi
 in an attempt to becomethe feudal lord, but failed!
 He has complained wheneveropportunity offered itself,
 after Lord Sagi becamethe feudal lord as well!
 A tactic like tormenting Lord Sagiby starting the rumor
 about the Cursed Warrior might bea piece of cake for Lord Komei…!
 All right! There’s no doubt.
 It’s settled. The true identity ofthe Cursed Warrior is Komei!
 The true identity of the ghostis revealed, huh…?
 Lord Komei, there was nothing unusualon the scheduled patrol.
 You may step down…
 Yes, sire.
 Aren’t we at our destination yet?!
 Just a little further untilLord Moso’s residence.
 Where is he?! This way?
 Where did he go?!
 Th-There he is!
 Get him! Drag him down!
 Cursed Warrior!
 He vanished.
 Lord Komei! Are you all right?!
 I’m fine. Don’t panic!
 What’s that?!
 It’s flying?!
 Clad in white armor,possesses a halberd,
 and wears a mask witha frightening look…
 There’s no doubt…lt’s the Cursed Warrior!
 After him!
 Are you going to ride onmy shoulders forever?
 Wait here! I’ll pin downthe true identity of the ghost!
 Huh? R-Right…
 Where’d he go?!
 Over there!
 Byakugan!
 I can’t see him…
 What does that mean?!
 There’s no human presence in here…
 At least, a living presence…
 Wh-Why do you put it that way…?
 Shh! Didn’t you hearsomething just now?
 I thought you didn’t feela human presence!
 I told you…living presence.

 He’s far away,but he might be quite cool.
 Shh, be quiet!
 What is it, Neji?
 Something’s strange.What’s with this blood thirst?
 What? Bloodthirsty?Could it be assassins?

 Leaf Village’s two-man cells arejust now heading there for back-up.
 How well prepared.
 It’s a pain,
 but as long as we’re doing this,we’ll do it right.
 We’ll do it perfectly withoutproducing casualties!
 Make sure you don’t cryin front of me this time.
 Are you going to holdthat over my head forever?
 Just like a woman…
 I-I feel like I don’t reallyhave my place in this.
 I’ll take care of all of you at once!
 Here it comes!
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 The distance created between usbecame too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouthmakes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile,even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Sealed Sand: The Counterattack!
 To think you’d askthe Leaf Village for help…
 I guess the Sand has lost the edgethey used to have, huh?
 Why are you here?
 You know, dogs.
 They’re not satisfied until a favorhas been properly returned.
 Especially this Akamaru!
 A dog retuning a favor doesn’thave much of a ring to it!
 Help is on the way tothe other two as well.
 You concentrate on this fight!
 You’re giving me lip!
 So you flies are gonna gang upon me, huh?
 But you’re no match for my Dragon Eye:Fang Release: Dark Sword.
 Eat this!
 If your Chakra isn't built up,your sand is no big deal at all!
 It’ll only be useful forblinding me at best!
 It’s futile!
 I feel it.Your Chakra is being sucked up.
 What?! He was setting the sandin the gourd aside?!
 I was being cautious,but he is much too strong.
 Gaara Sensei!
 Just what I’d expect fromGaara of the Sand.
 He’s not called the ultimate weaponfor nothing…
 The ultimate…weapon?!
 However, he cannot exceedour Ninja tools
 forged in the Village of the Artisans!
 Gaara!
 Hey, he’s totally got the edge!
 Do we have a chance toreturn the favor?
 That’s incredible wind.What an amount of Chakra…
 No, it seems that sword isamplifying her Chakra.
 So she’s relying on that sword forall of her attack and defense, huh?
 Anyway, we’ve got to slip withinfiring range for our Jutsu
 and stop her movements!
 Right.
 Let’s go at once!
 Annoying!
 She’s attempting to maintainher distance just from Temari.
 I see.
 So she just wants to pay attentionto the long range-type Temari and
 blow us mid-range Jutsu usersaway with wind
 before we can get close, huh…?
 Now then, what should we do?
 Man Beast Clone!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Crow!
 – Arms! 					– Fang Over Fang!
 Did you guys come toget in my way?!
 We made sure to send youa signal, right?!
 How could I tell?!
 We don’t click at all?
 Are you guys…messing around?!
 Be more serious and die!
 Talking nonsense!
 Although I reduced the damagewith my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still…
 Just what I’d expect of Gaara,
 the Sand’s ultimate weaponwho hosts the Shukaku…
 But you’re already in our hands.
 What should I do?She’s beyond the range of my Jutsu…
 and I don’t see anything around herethat could be used to extend my shadow.
 Hey!
 What’re you whispering about?
 What’re you thinking?!
 I’ll explain later, for crying out loud.Can you do it or not?
 I suppose I could try, but…
 What is it…?
 What’s he doing?
 Behold the terror of Ninja toolsour village created.
 What’s this Chakra?
 This is a water vein!
 I get it!
 The lines connecting the pointin the center and triangle isn’t a Barrier…
 It’s a water vein!
 Ninja Tool Barrier:Reverse Scale Formation… Activate!
 Oh no!
 Gaara Sensei!
 The aim of the Reverse Scale Formationwas a single point, Gaara from the start!
 Our swords accurately piercea water vein
 and summon the water dragon.
 Sand has sucked upa large amount of water
 and has become as heavy as lead…
 Now Gaara can no longer use sand.
 Gaara!
 – Gaara! 					– Calm down!
 Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!
 That guy is?!
 They’ll save Gaara,no matter what.
 We need to concentrate onthe enemy in front of us.
 To think you’d choosea sandy area to fall on…
 Just what I’d expect of Gaaraof the desert…
 However!
 That’s as far asyour useless resistance goes!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 A hero’s turn always comes late!
 That’s right!
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!
 Naruto…!
 It seems you rushed to everyoneduring the Sasuke incident…
 This time we’ve come to returnthe favor from that time.
 So we’ll take that guy on!
 You hurry to your student straight on!
 To think he’d corner you this far…
 – Lee! 					– Sakura!
 Leave Gaara’s treatment to me!Lee, you go with Naruto!
 – Sakura! 					– Got it!
 Then I’ll be going first!
 Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!
 I’ll suck up all of your Chakra!
 I see. So this means we can’trelease our regular power?
 That doesn’t matter!
 Even without Chakra,we’ve got fighting spirit!
 Yes! We’ll go with thatplus willpower!
 Just as I thought.
 That they haven’t launched anythingduring the fight thus far means
 the two reinforcements don’thave long range-type Jutsu.
 Then I’ll maintain this distance and…
 you’ll die getting torn up by the wind!
 While she’s distracted by Shikamaruand the others,
 I’ll just go for it!
 Mind Destruction…!
 Ino!
 Foolish girl. It’s useless to attemptto exploit an opening!
 You little!
 You won’t get close to me!I’ve read your range as well!
 I don’t know about that…!
 Ino! You stay right there!
 I’m counting on you…!
 Shino! Sakura!
 There’s one woundedat the waterfall.
 Tunneling Fang!
 Now!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Oh…!
 What’re you doing?!
 Are you guys…mocking me?
 After sucking up all of your Chakra,I’ll be returning the favor plenty!
 The contusion treatment is complete.
 But, the depletion of Chakrais overwhelming.
 Contact from your friends…?
 – Ino’s hurt?! 					– Go!
 Wha--?! But in your condition…
 I’m okay now. Help your friend!
 Okay. Don’t push yourself.
 Yeah…
 What’re you doing?!Hurry up and go after your comrade!
 I’ll help my comrade.
 I’ll settle this in a moment.
 But…
 Bushy Brow!
 Damn it. It’s no goodjust shot-gunning it!
 It’s just him?
 A part of Black Ant…
 Could it be…a signal?
 Fang Over Fang once more!
 Back me up with Crow!
 I’m counting on youfor back up too, Choji!
 Got it!
 Heh! Bossing me around.
 The counterattack starts now!
 It’s futile. Your Jutsu won’t reach me!
 You never know until you try, right…?!
 Here we go!
 Wind Style: Cyclone Scythe!
 Huh?!
 What’re you aiming at?!Totally misguided…
 Say what?
 What’s the meaning of this?
 I’m sure I’d read your range already…!
 I’ll show you!
 I can create a shadow withthis thick a current
 even if the water’s clear.
 My Jutsu’s range has infinitelyimproved by lifting the waterfall!
 The Shadow Possession Jutsuis a success!
 Summoning…
 Blade Dance!
 This one’s done!
 Good grief…
 I…couldn’t do anything.
 Here everyone’s doing their best…
 Only I…
 Ino?
 Gaara.
 You don’t have any sandleft you can use.
 What’s this?!
 He smashed the Sand Armor.
 No way! But the sandheavy with water like that…
 If I just suck up the Chakra…
 This is my weapon!
 You okay, Gaara?!
 This is the finishing blow…
 Gaara Sensei!
 Hurry! Leave the rest to us!
 Man Beast Clone!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Annoying buzzing flies!
 Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword!
 What?!
 Oh, no!
 Puppet Show…
 Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!
 The show’s  over!
 – We did it! 					– Yeah!
 Matsuri.
 Gaara and…!
 A Shinobi carrying a child on his back.
 He’s heading for the valley.
 The last one…
 Gaara is chasing him!
 What?!
 You okay, Bushy Brow?Sakura will be right back.
 Thanks.
 Well, I’m going after Gaara!
 Got it! I’ll meet up with you later!
 I’ve got him cornered.
 Matsuri.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 I heard you figured out the identitiesof the Four Celestials?
 Yes. They are the Ninja ofthe Village of the Artisans
 who've been harboring ill feelingtoward the Five Great Nations.
 It seems they’ve completedthe forbidden project
 passed down in the village and
 intend to resurrecttheir ultimate weapon.
 I see. I take it the other villagersgot wind of it and evacuated.
 Exactly. You head over towhere they are immediately.
 Yes, ma’am.

19,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 The Demon in the Snow
 Gatô, why did you come here?
 And who are those henchmen?
 Our strategy has changeda little…
 I'm sorry about this Zabuza,
 but you will die here.
 What?!
 Since hiring a regular Shinobicosts a lot of money,
 I hired Rouge Ninjas like you.
 And, it would have been evenmore ideal
 to save my money and effort ifNinja-to-Ninja battles
 ended in each killing the other off.
 Well, you are certainly not worthyof being called
 the Demon of theHidden Mist Village.
 If you were to ask me,you're just a cute little demon!
 What are those guys?
 So many of them…
 Kakashi…I apologize.
 Our fight ends here...
 As long as my reason totake down Tazuna is gone,
 there is no reason to fight you either.
 Yeah... you are right.
 That reminds me...
 I owe him something.
 He squeezed my arm 'til it broke...
 Huh, he's dead.
 You bastard!
 What do you think you're doing, hey?!
 Stop! Don't act so recklessly…!
 You say something, too!He was your comrade, right?
 Shut up, punk.Haku is already dead.
 What…?
 Don't you feel anything watchinghim doing that!
 Weren't you with Haku for a long time!
 As Gatô used me…I was simply using Haku.
 I thought I'd told you…
 We Shinobi are merely tools.
 What I wanted were his skillsand not Haku himself.
 I have no regrets...
 Do you...Do you really mean that?
 Naruto, stop.
 There's no need to fighthim anymore...  Besides...
 Shut up!My enemy is still... this one!
 He...
 He really liked you!
 Is there someone special in your life?
 He liked you that much!
 When a person feels he wantsto protect a person special to him,
 that person can truly become strong.
 Even so,don't you feel anything at all?!
 It's difficult for me to completelybecome a Shinobi.
 You really... honestly...
 don't feel anything at all?
 I'd like to make that person'sdream come true...
 For that, I could completelybecome a Shinobi.
 When a person becomesas strong as you...
 Does that person reallybehave like you?
 He threw his life awayfor you!
 I'd like to make thatperson’s dream come true...
 That is my dream.
 He didn't even fulfill hisown dreams and yet...
 I was happy.
 To die as a tool...!
 That's...That's... too painful...
 Kid...
 Don't say anything... anymore.
 Haku was...
 He wasn't just thinking of me.
 He was feeling pain insidefor you
 while he battled you guys too...
 I know. 					He was too kind...
 I'm glad we could fight with youat the end.
 Huh?
 Yes, little punk,it's as you say, after all...
 Shinobi are human too...
 Maybe it's impossible to becomean emotionless tool...
 I've lost.
 Kid! Give me the Kunai knife!
 Okay...
 What?!
 Enough! Take them down!
 Right!
 Are you crazy?
 Do you think you can win by yourselfagainst this many of us?
 D-Demon!
 If you're so anxiousto join your friend...
 you go ahead... alone!
 Unfortunately...
 I don't... intend on going...to the same place... as Haku!
 W-What?! Pretending to be so tough...
 You're going to hell with me!
 It's no big deal...
 When the Demon ofthe Hidden Mists Village
 dies and goes to hell,he can become a real demon.
 Look forward to it!
 I'll let you find outfor sure
 if I'm a cute little demon or not in hell!
 Haku...
 Now... it's goodbye, Haku...
 Thanks for everything...
 I'm sorry...
 Don't look away.
 It's the end fora man who lived fiercely.
 Yup...
 Did I... die...?
 Sasuke!
 Sakura...
 Am I... am I...?!
 Sakura, you're heavy.
 Huh?!
 Sasuke...
 Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke...!
 Sakura... 					That hurts...
 Things turned out well, didn't they, Sakura?
 Stop, you shouldn't move...!
 Anyway, where's Naruto?
 And also,what happened to that mask guy?
 Naruto's fine.
 And... the masked kid,he died...
 Died? Did Naruto get him?
 Well... I'm not really sure,but he protected Zabuza...
 I had faith in you.
 You are awesome, Sasuke!
 You avoided getting inflicted withany mortal wounds!
 From the beginning... he intended to...
 Naruto!
 Sakura...
 Sasuke's all right!He's alive!
 Huh?
 He was feeling pain insidefor you while he battled you guys too...
 He was too kind...
 I see... He...
 So, Sasuke's all right too...
 That's a relief...
 Hey, hey, hey!
 You guys are too relaxed!
 Darn Ninja...!Killing our source of money!
 Now that it's come to this,
 there's no choice but to attackthe whole town and
 take everything valuable!
 Shoot, this isn't good!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Don't you have a Jutsuto annihilate them all at once?
 That's impossible!I've used too much Chakra!
 Here we go!
 Enemies who come any closerto the island...
 With all the might ofall the island's people...
 will not be allowed to live!
 Yeah!
 Inari!
 Heroes always arriveon the scene late!
 Inari... You guys...
 Okay, I'm gonna help out, too!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 I can do that evenwith my scarce Chakra...
 At least, it will bluff...
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Kakashi Version!
 So... are you ready to fight?!
 No, we're not!
 We've done it!
 Sounds like it’s over.
 Yeah...
 Kakashi...I need to ask you a favor.
 What is it?
 His...I want to see his face...
 All right.
 Huh?
 Snow...
 Snow at this timeof the year...?
 Haku... 					Are you crying?
 Thanks, Kakashi...
 You were always at my side...
 At the very least...
 I can be at your side in the end.
 If it's possible...
 I'd like to go...
 to the same place...
 as you.
 This guy...
 He was born in a villagewhere it snowed a lot.
 I see...
 He was a boy as pure as snow...
 You'd be able to go, Zabuza.
 The two of you... together.
 But you know, Kakashi Sensei...
 Hmm?
 I wonder if the way a Ninjashould be
 is really as thesetwo were saying.
 Shinobi should not seekthe reason for their own existence.
 What's important is toexist merely as tools.
 That's the same in the Land of Leaves.
 I wonder if that's whatit really means
 to become a real Ninja.
 I guess... I guess...!
 I don't like that!
 Do you think so, too?
 Hmm...
 Well... That's why all Ninja live
 trying to figure thatout without realizing...
 Like Zabuza... and that kid...
 Okay!
 Huh?
 I've just decided!
 I'm going to pursue myown Way of Ninja!
 I'm gonna sprint straightahead and pursue
 a way that I absolutelywon't regret!
 Thanks to you the bridgewas safely completed,
 but we will miss you very much.
 Take care.
 Thank you for everything.
 Now, now!
 We'll come back fora visit again, Tazuna!
 For sure...?
 Huh?
 Inari... you're gonnamiss us, aren't you?
 It's all right to cry.Go ahead and cry!
 I won't cry!
 It's all right if you cry,Naruto!
 Oh, is that so?
 See ya!
 Oh....!
 You are so stubborn.
 That boy changed Inari's mind...
 and Inari changed the mindsof the village people.
 That boy created a bridgelinking us to hope,
 a bridge called courage.
 So a linking bridge...
 Speaking of bridges,
 we need to namethis bridge, don't we?
 That's true.
 In that case,
 I have a perfect namefor this bridge.
 Yeah, what is it?
 The Naruto Great Bridge?How's that ?
 That's a good name.
 Okay! I'll get back soonand have Iruka Sensei treat me
 to ramen asthe mission completion celebration!
 And! And! I'll tell Konohamarutales of my heroic exploits!
 Then I...
 Hey! Sasuke, do you want to goon a date
 when we get back to the village?
 No, I don't think so.
 Just like that...?!
 You know! You know!I'll go with you!
 Be quiet!
 Shut up! Naruto!
 What? Are you surethat name's okay?
 This name is to wish thatthis bridge will never collapse...
 And someday, it'll be the nameof a very famous bridge...
 A name heard around the world.
 That's truly what I hope.
 Hey, hey!
 Our Group Seven alwayshas the easy missions lately.
 Meanwhile, there are plenty ofpowerful Ninja
 like Zabuza and Haku in other lands.
 Aren't there more exciting missionswhere I can be more active?

 D-Did that get him?
 Gaara…
 Doing all that work…And managing just one blow, huh?
 S-Shut up!
 He attacked the base of the tailwhich has the weakest defense…
 Even though I’m not wounded,I can’t absorb the impact.

 Because he has gone through life

 I thought…he was strong.

 But that’s not the meaningof true strength…
 If one fights just foroneself in solitude…
 one can’t really become strong…

 Then that guy over theretried to bully me!
 What was that?!
 When that happened,this guy here rescued me…
 He clashed with that monster…
 Pretty interesting guy.
 I see…
 Kid… I recognize youas my henchman…
 and I’ll show you what dutyand respect means!
 I’ll make you pay the pricegood and proper, you underling!
 Hang on tight!
 How’s that?!
 Awesome…
 What a guy…
 He’s so heavy,
 I could barely manage tothrust my dagger through him.
 If I don’t hurry up,
 this battle will changethe shape of the landscape.
 Hey! Hey! Chief!
 Sakura is over that way,so don’t move that way!
 Please lure him in this direction.
 Sakura…?
 That’s his girlfriend, Pop.
 I’ve got to take that guy down.
 Otherwise, I won’t be ableto rescue Sakura!
 Interesting!
 This is interesting!Naruto Uzumaki!
 T-This isn’t good!
 That Gaara…He’s intending to do that thing.
 I better get out of here!
 Huh…? That is…
 That’s…the medium…?
 To thank you for entertaining meup to now…
 I’ll show you the real power…
 of the Sand Spirit!
 The circles under his eyes…
 Those are symptoms ofinsomnia which indicate
 that the medium is also possessedby the Shukaku of the Sand.
 Insomnia…?
 Those who are possessedby the Demon Raccoon Shukaku
 are unable to sleep soundlythrough the entire night.
 Because of the terror…
 If one sleeps, Shukaku will slowlyeat away at their personality
 and eventually that personis no longer himself.
 Because he normallydoesn’t get much sleep…
 the medium’s personalitytends to…become unstable.
 Oh…
 Therefore, usually whilethe medium is awake,
 the power of Shukaku isnormally controlled.
 However…
 when that medium sleeps…
 Playing Possum Jutsu!
 He’s done it…!
 W-What’s gonna happen, Chief?
 If one sets Playing Possum Jutsuinto motion…
 …the Shukaku will appear!
 I’m finally able to emerge!
 That’s the Shukaku?
 He’s pretty funky…
 Right away!The guy I wanna kill! You!
 I’m gonna jump…
 Huh?
 Wind Style: Air Bullets!
 Water Style: Water Bullets!
 That’s practically a storm…
 What kind of a battle is this…?!
 Chief! I told you,not in that direction!
 Shut up! I know!
 Air Bullets!
 Water Bullets!
 Too bad…
 This isn’t good, Chief!There's one shot left…!
 Yeah! I killed it…
 I killed it!
 That hurts…!
 How dare you shoot me
 with bullets containingstupid amounts of Chakra!
 Even I can’t take that many shots!
 What should we do?!
 For a start,wake up that medium kid!
 It will release that Jutsu!
 How do we go about waking him?!
 Give him a good punch!
 Water Bullets!
 Like I’ll take that!
 Now!
 Chief, I can’t hit himunless you hold him down!
 This Toad doesn’t have fangs or clawsto hold that guy’s movement.
 What should we do then?!
 We’ll use the Transform Jutsu tochange into something that has those!
 But with that said…
 I’m not particularly goodat transformations.
 Huh?
 So you will act as my willand make the Sign!
 Whaaaat?!
 Time for a combined transformation!
 Uh…Okay!
 We got to have fangs and claws!
 Umm…
 Let’s go!
 Wait…Say, w-wait a second…!
 F- Fangs and claws… Fangs and claws…Fangs and claws!
 Transform!
 Transform Jutsu!
 That’s the…!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 I don’t know about your past,and my past doesn’t matter either!
 I only have people who I must protect.
 Hey you with no eyebrows!
 Let’s just end this as similar fighters.
 I will finish this with my next hit.
 This will be, absolutely and totally,the last one!

 At the very least this sword…
 It was a fitting end for somebody like you
 who has masteredthe Way of the Shinobi.
 It feels like my arms are burning…
 Master Orochimaru!
 This is where we call off our plan.
 Release the Barrier.We’ll head back.
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 – Release! 					– Release!
 The Barrier…!
 It’s released!

 We won’t let you get away!

 Kakashi! They’re on the move!Do we go after them?
 No, wait, Guy.
 That’s right…
 If you make a move withoutany data on the situation up there,
 you will get caught inthe enemy’s trap.
 I’m totally aware of that.
 But regardless of whetherthere is a trap or not,
 we can’t let the enemy get awayat a time like this!
 That is the way of the Leaf Shinobi!
 So…are you just going to watch?
 Kabuto?
 So you did know, after all.
 So…what are we going to do?
 It’s about time thatwe made a retreat.
 You’re going to run awayfrom me again?
 Right now…
 if we show our cards,they’re most likely going to be copied.
 Then again,
 it doesn't seem like you’ve completelymastered that eye like the Uchiha clan.
 Well then…
 Temari…
 Kankuro!
 I’m leaving Sakura with you.
 H-Hey!
 Why is…this guy so strong?
 My existence will not disappear…
 I will not disappear!I cannot disappear!
 I told you not to talk to that guy!
 Let’s go.
 Oh, there! That’s him…
 Go away!
 Monster! Monster! Monster…!
 You monster! Die!
 That’s him… Don’t get involved, fool!
 Don’t look at him!
 Go away!
 To them, I’m just a relic of the pastwho they want to see disappear.
 So what did I have in this life,why did I keep living?
 And that time, I thought of myself that I…no, that is what I had to think.
 And then knew thatit was the most painful thing.
 That I… that my existence didn’t matterto anyone else in the world.
 D-Don’t come any closer!
 The pain of…being all alone…really is unbearable, isn’t it?
 The way you feel…
 I don’t know why,but I completely understand that it hurts.
 But I’ve met people who arevery important to me now.
 I won’t allow those important people…to get hurt!
 If not, I will stop you even ifthat means…that I have to kill you!
 Why…?
 How is it that you can fight so muchfor other people?
 They saved me from the hellof being all alone.
 They accepted me for who I was.
 That’s why…they are important to me!
 Love is a heart that desires to servea precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person…
 Love…
 That is why he is so strong?
 That’s enough, Naruto…
 Sakura is okay.
 This guy’s Chakra musthave been depleted as well…
 Sakura’s sand crumbleda long time ago.
 Oh, I see…
 I’ve had enough… Stop here.
 Gaara?
 I’ve never seen Gaara in sucha weakened state before…
 All right.
 Naruto Uzumaki, huh?
 LOVE							One of these days, even I…
 Temari… Kankuro…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Sorry…
 D-Don’t worry about it…
 Rain…
 The sky has started to weep as well…
 We will begin the memorial service
 for the Third Hokage,who lost his life in this battle,
 as well as the other victimsof this battle.
 It’s started…
 In the end,all we could do was just watch…
 Why?
 Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?
 Why…?
 It’s already been a year…
 It’s not easy to laughhiding your sadness.
 I heard from your teacher thatyou’re the center of laughter…
 I’m not sad at all!
 It’s a very honorable thing fora Shinobi to die doing their duty!
 My dad and mom sacrificed their lives
 to protect this villagefrom the Demon Fox…
 They’re heroes!
 I am the child of the heroes!I’m not sad to be alone.
 And besides, these are tears of joy.
 It’s all right.
 I know that you’re curled upholding your knees by yourself.
 But you’re not alone…
 Huh?
 The Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Villagehave the will of fire…
 Will of fire…?
 It’s the strong will to protectthe Leaf Village.
 As long as they have this will of fire,everybody in this village are all family.
 Iruka… I wonder if you have it?
 Yeah…
 For Hayate…?
 The Third Hokage’s funeralhas already started. Make it quick.
 You too, Kakashi, is it for Obito…?
 If you’re always thinking ofan excuse for your tardiness,
 you should just come earlier.
 I do…from early in the morning.
 It’s just that,whenever I come here
 I just want to punish myselffor being such a fool in the past.
 Humph…
 Shinobi, no matter what kindof situation they are in,
 cannot show their emotion.
 You must always prioritize your mission,
 and never shed a tear inany kind of situation…
 Iruka Sensei…
 Hmm?
 Why do people risk their own livesfor other people?
 When one person dies…
 their past, their present life, and their futuredisappear along with them.
 Many people die doing their dutyand fighting in battle…
 And shockingly easily, too.
 Hayate was one of them.
 Those who pass away alsohave dreams and ambitions.
 But everyone has something else,just as important.
 Parents, siblings, friends, lovers…Those who are dear to them.
 They trust each other and help each other,
 the people whom they’ve cherishedsince the day they were born.
 And that string which connectsthose people
 becomes stronger andthicker as time goes by…
 It can’t be explained by logic…
 Those who hold those strings just do it,because it’s important to them.
 Yeah, I kind of get it.
 But…
 It's tough to die.
 It’s not like he just died for nothing.
 He left us something very important.
 Well, you’ll eventually understandone of these days.
 Yeah, I kind of get that too!
 The rain’s stopped.
 Bye! Iruka Sensei!
 Yeah…
 Lord Third Hokage,the will of fire you spoke of
 seems to have been passed onto the young Leaves.
 The flame in their heartswhich you lit
 will burn bright and strong…
 And it will shine upon this village,and watch over and protect us.
 It will become a new Hokage…one of these days…
 They did manage to avoid annihilation,
 but it seems the damageis pretty extensive.
 The village that was onceat the height of its glory…
 How sad…
 How unlike you.
 You have lingering affectionsfor your old home?
 Even you?
 No, not at all.
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?

 It awakens childhood memory,disappointment, ire, and resolve.

 I see…

 Are you hurt?
 I should be asking you that, Chishima.
 You shouldn’t be movingwith that injury.
 I’m fine.
 More importantly,we need to find Lady Toki.
 Oh yeah, that’s right…

 I’m right here…

 I’ll have you guys embrace those secretsas you plunge headfirst into hell…

 with you and Lord Sagi.

 the Land of Bird was tranquil,gentle and warm…

 to the way it was in those days…

 Hang in there!
 Naruto, I beg you…
 help Lady Toki…help my friend…
 Sure thing.lf a Leaf Ninja promises something,
 he will complete it to the very end.
 Promise me…
 You must…you must… protect Lady Toki…
 You have feelings for her, don’t you?
 That ramen…was delicious…
 I’ll treat you to some again…
 Thank you… Naruto…
 Chishima!
 Chishima!
 Chishima…!
 That guy was nothing more
 than just anotherconvenient servant, after all.
 Shut up!
 He loved the Land of Birdswith all his might…
 Chishima, who staked his life tryingto protect the country he loved…
 I will not…forgive you,no matter what!

 Yes, we should be ableto reach Naruto.
 Unfortunately, I cannot allow youto avenge the blood of the fallen.
 The least I can do for you,out of charity,
 is send you to the same placeyour father and brother are.
 I don’t care.
 Why don’t you just kill mein one stroke?
 You know when to give up, huh?
 They’re all dead.I’m the only one left in this world.
 Now that I am unable to take revenge,
 I have no more reason to live.
 You’re a courageous girl,aren’t you?
 All right, I’ll grant your wish.
 Resign yourself!
 Wake up.
 Save Toki… Save my little sister…
 I entrusted the future ofthe Land of Birds to my younger sister
 and gave her the watch.
 But Toki became obsessedwith her desire for revenge.
 I, a dead soul, cannot changemy younger sister’s heart
 which is stalled in time.
 I’m begging you,
 please make my younger sister’s timebegin to move again towards the future.
 What was that just now?
 Die!
 What?
 Hold it!
 What?
 Hold it!
 Naruto!
 I met your elder brother ina dream a little while ago.
 Elder Brother?
 It wasn’t the wish ofyour elder brother Sagi
 that you avenge his death.
 He wanted to leave the careof this land in your hands.
 But…
 For Chishima’s sake too…
 you must make thisLand of Bird a great country…
 That’s why you must live, Toki…
 Naruto…
 It doesn’t make any difference to me.
 The two of you are goingto die here in any case.
 Hey, Hoki, you want this Land, right?
 What…
 But a person with an impure heart,with a heart bent on revenge,
 cannot govern this land.
 The reason this was sucha wonderful country was because
 Chishima and Sagi and Toki’s heartswere all connected.
 Even if you use dirty tricksto gain status,
 you will never be able to controlthe hearts of the people…
 Speak for yourself, squirt!

 when using Shadow Clones…

 Thank you, Naruto!
 I was just carrying out my mission.
 More importantly…
 Make that guy pay dearly forhis crimes, okay.
 Yes.
 I’m sure that Sagi is happyabout this too.
 You met…you met Elder Brother Sagi…
 Yeah, in a dream.
 But even if it was in a dream,
 it doesn’t change the fact thathe asked me to do something.
 What did Elder Brother say to you?
 Well, he said something aboutstarting up your time again.
 My time?
 He said he wanted you to forgetabout things like revenge
 and instead live for the future.
 Elder Brother…

 But…
 It looks like the Wandering Ninjaare going to get a really stiff sentence.
 Yeah… And Toki was finally able tobreak the curse of seeking revenge…
 Hey, it’s gonna start!
 Down on your knees!
 Ohhh…wow…
 I must apologize for havingdeceived everyone
 by using my brother’s name fraudulently,
 and claimingthe title of feudal lord.
 In a case such as this,
 it may well be proper to hand overthe title of feudal lord to someone else.
 However, if you will forgive me,
 I would like to ask you toallow me to work
 on behalf of Land of Birdsas your lord.
 For my deceased father Owashi,and brother Sagi…
 And for my dear friend Chishimawho loves this country so dearly…
 Lady Toki…
 As long as there is breath in my body,
 I would like to work positivelyto rebuild this country.
 She’s doing an excellent job, isn’t she?
 Toki, awesome!
 As you wish, Lady Toki…
 It appears thatyou all agree too, correct?
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Thank you…
 To Komei…for accepting meas your feudal lord…to everyone…
 And to the young Ninja who taught me
 what it is that I should reallystake my life on…
 You’re embarrassing me…
 Land of Birds
 Please take the best of carealong the road now.
 Fare thee well.
 Chishima, be nice to Toki, okay?
 Thank you, Naruto.
 Please come back to visitagain soon.
 Sure, next time I’d loveto visit without a mission.
 Goodbye.
 Goodbye. Be well…
 See you…
 Toki…she was really kindand gorgeous too, wasn’t she?
 I’m certain that the Land of Birdswill become a wonderful land again,
 just like it was in the old days.
 Yeah.
 By the way, Naruto…did you really meet Sagi’s ghost?
 You gotta be kidding.
 There’s no such things as ghosts…that was all in a dream.
 I’m not so sure it was just a dream.
 Wh-What the heck are youtalking about?!
 Do you remember that Cursed Warriorwe cornered the very first time?
 Uh, yeah.
 Yeah, he was empty inside.
 Th-This…?
 The inside of it is empty.
 Yeah, but that was just sortof gimmick, right?
 Some kind of string or pieceof wire or something…
 No, I definitely saw it with my Byakugan.
 Now that you mention it,
 you said there was no sign of life,right, Neji?
 Yeah…I didn’t feel a speck of lifefrom that Cursed Warrior.
 In other words, there wasa ghost there.
 So that was a real ghost, after all?!
 Calm down, Naruto.
 That's not true…That's not true!
 Tell me that’s not true!

 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 A Clash of Fate:                      You Can't Bring Me Down!
 What incredible Chakra…lt’s making my skin tingle.
 My nose  too…
 Mizuki…
 What’s the matter?Aren’t you coming?
 You jerk…!
 Hey, Naruto!
 Stop that!
 You idiot.
 Naruto!
 Hey, hey.
 Should you really be worryingabout others right now?
 He’s fast!
 And what’s more, such power…
 So this is the power Lord Orochimaruwas talking about…
 Amazing… It’s almost scary…
 Don’t you agree, Iruka?
 Mizuki, please stop.
 Please…!
 Tsubaki…
 I don’t care what happensto me…
 I just don’t want you tocommit any more crimes.
 Please!
 Return to the village.
 Tsubaki… If you care that muchabout me,
 then you could at leastbe useful to me!
 Tsubaki…!
 What?!
 You’re so slow.
 Iruka Sensei…!
 Damn!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hasty as always, huh…
 You sure haven’t madeany progress, have you?
 He vanished!
 He didn’t vanish.He’s just fast.
 That guy’s been accelerating since earlierand moving into our blind spots…
 In that case…
 Everybody, better be very awareof your surroundings!
 I call itUzumaki Whirpool Formation!
 – Right! 					– Right!
 I see…
 Even an idiot like him comes upwith an idea once in a while.
 In that case…
 I want to watch you experienceeven deeper despair…
 Despair that’s equal to that wisdomyou’ve managed to muster!
 There he is!
 I see him!
 It’s not that you saw me.
 I’m going out of my wayto show myself to you.
 There!
 Damn… Even though I can see him,I‘m unable to land any blows.
 I’m telling you, I’m not foreseeingyour movements.
 You’re just sluggish.
 Oww…
 Hey, serves you right.
 You demon fox.
 Don’t be so delighted in sucha big way.
 You’ll now get a taste ofthe same agony I have endured.
 Starting now, right, Naruto?
 There’s still much moreto come!
 Stop that, Mizuki!Don’t lay your hands on Naruto!
 Shut up, Iruka!
 Do you have any idea how muchI’ve been waiting for this moment?
 I’ve been waiting for this dayever since then.
 For this time of revenge.
 I will use this power of mine
 and take my own good timeto crush each of you, one at a time.
 Come on, stand up, Iruka.I’ll start by killing this guy.
 Mizuki…!
 There you go. 					That’s good!
 Come on!
 You are pathetic.
 There’s a world of differencebetween us, isn’t there?
 I’ve gotten my hands onthis extreme body
 and it is your fateto die wretchedly.
 What do you mean, ""extreme body""?
 When your power dependson potions,
 it’s not true power!
 That sounds just likethe half-baked guy you are…
 In that case, go aheadand try winning…
 Using that real poweryou’re talking about!
 I’m different from you.You're gonna live out your life…
 as some lowly teacher who never thinks about getting ahead in life,
 who only gets used by the villagein whatever way they see fit.
 How do you like…this power…and the way I carry myself?!
 Even if you traineda hundred years,
 you'll never be ableto earn it!
 I’m not gonna stop here!
 I’m still gonna get muchmuch stronger…
 I’ll get Orochimaru to sharehis Hidden Jutsu with me.
 Do you really think that will happen?
 I’m getting tired of youplaying the martyr.
 I think it’s about timeto end this.
 Isn’t this nostalgic…?
 This time, I’ll get you for sure.
 So prepare yourself.
 Naruto!
 You jerk! Don’t you dare layyour hands on Iruka Sensei!
 This is really something!
 Every little thing is exactly the sameas it was that other time.
 But I’ve changed.
 The reason for my defeatthat time…
 was that I let my guard downto the demon fox that you are.
 Wh-What’s that?!
 I won’t let my guard down again.
 I’ll call upon all my strengthto beat you down!
 Bring it on!
 I’m sorry…both of you…
 Choji!
 Damn… If only I had a little moreinformation about those guys…
 Elder Brother…My body feels lighter.
 Yeah, Raijin, it feels lighter,doesn’t it?
 Okay, time for clobbering…
 Yeah! Clobbering!
 There they come.
 Damn it!
 Huh?
 What the hell is this?!
 M-My body…
 Doesn’t move…!
 Huh? Genjutsu Paralysis?
 Looks like I made it in time.
 Good work!Shikamaru, Ino, Choji!
 Leave the rest to me!
 The F-Fifth Hokage!
 No way…Lady Hokage…in person?!
 Lady Tsunade.
 I’m sorry I found outabout this so late.
 But I wouldn’t have imagined
 that these guys werehanging out with Mizuki…
 Fifth Hokage!
 We are saved…!
 Uh…uh…Elder Brother…
 Oh…Oh…
 Well, we run into each otherin unusual places, don’t we,
 Fujin and Raijin?
 T-Tsunade…
 Let me ask whatyou’re doing here.
 Powerful.
 More like, scary.
 Now then, is there somethingyou want to say?
 I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
 Please forgive me.We’ll never do it again!
 So you guys went with Mizukibecause he told you that
 you’d be able to eat something goodat Orochimaru’s place?
 – I’m, I’m sorry.– I’m, I’m sorry.
 No way we could stand up to guys on thesame level as the Three Legendary Ninja.
 But I wonder what happenedbetween them the past…
 to make those two that scared.
 No thanks. I don’t even wantto imagine what it might be.
 Gimme a break.Falling for such an obvious bait!
 Mizuki has apparently goneinto those mountains up ahead.
 Naruto and Iruka are probablywith him…
 You guys come alongafter recuperating a little.
 Huh…wait a minute.
 What are we going to dowith these two guys?
 Huh? You don’t needto worry about that…
 More importantly, I can’t let themcause any more trouble.
 I’ve decided to make these guysgo home on their own.
 Hey, Fujin, Raijin. I assumeyou understand this already,
 but if you’re even one minute lateyou’re not getting any dinner.
 – Yes, ma’am! 					– Yes, ma’am!
 We can’t be doing this, Raijin.
 Let’s hurry back to the institution.
 Elder Brother, dinner, right?!
 Dinner!
 – Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner…– Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner…
 Amazing…what incredible speed.
 It’s very important fora person to eat, after all.
 That’s just you.
 Damn! His power iseven greater than earlier!
 But I can’t let himtake me down.
 This guy may have a leadto Sasuke’s whereabouts.
 Naruto!
 Iruka, are you all right?
 Yes...
 Did you notice?
 What?
 Although that jerk’s powerhas increased multifold,
 the sharpness of his movementsis diminishing.
 Huh?
 Did he transfer the Chakrahe was using for speed, to power?
 I don’t really know that, but…
 That’s quite a heavy burdenfor Naruto to bear alone.
 But if that guy’s speedhas diminished,
 there might be a chance to win.
 All right… You hang in therea little bit more, Naruto!
 How about this,you little brat?
 Do you like the power of this bodythat Lord Orochimaru gave me!
 I’ll tear you apart.
 Where the hell is he…?
 That Orochimaru…Where is he?
 Why would I tell a little bratlike you that kind of thing?
 He wasn’t inthe Village Hidden in the Sound.
 The Village Hidden in the Sound?Did you go there?!
 The compound wasalready totally empty…
 Neither Sasuke nor Orochimaruwas there anymore.
 You really gave that onea lot of thought for a guy like you, huh…
 I don’t know where you heard thatabout the Village Hidden in the Sound…
 but if you’re trying to fluster meby talking rubbish like that,
 it’s not gonna happen.
 Give up ‘cause you’re goingto the next world.
 Listen carefully. Don’t you dare talkthat kind of trash again!
 Naruto, this way.
 Iruka Sensei…
 Just try to catch me!
 You jerk…don’t even thinkI’m gonna let you get away!
 Now! Jump up, Naruto!
 All right!!
 Damn…this is…!
 Seal and Capture Perimeter!
 The Capture and Arrest Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Naruto, that Jutsu is…
 So that’s the Fourth Hokage’sJutsu… Rasengan…
 Are you all right, Iruka Sensei?
 Naruto, that was spectacular.Good work!
 Listen Sensei…
 It looks like this guy didn’t knowabout the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 So I was thinking that he’s no longer…with Orochimaru…
 Don’t talk trash…
 Mizuki…
 You gotta be kidding…
 This is an extreme body thatI received from Lord Orochimaru…
 I will go to the Village of Hidden Soundand become even more…
 Iruka Sensei What’s this?!
 It’s just as I thought, after all.
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 Lady Tsunade.
 His cells have started dying.
 You jerk…What have you done to me?!
 It’s not Naruto’s fault.
 It’s caused from the substancesyou took!
 What? That’s impossible!
 You’re getting a taste ofyour own medicine.
 That substance wasn’tfully developed yet.
 The last casualty has been recovered.
 It appears that Shizune was injured,but there’s no threat to her life.
 I see. Thanks for your work.
 That’s a relief… Shizune is safe.
 Orochimaru probably developedthat substance by chance
 while he was trying to developa Forbidden Jutsu.
 What is certain is that
 that substance assimilatesthe DNA of animals
 and when it combineswith the human body
 that serves to draw out its powerin an explosive manner.
 But its effect is only short term.
 And in exchange,it puts a strain on the cells
 that far exceeds the limitsof the human body.
 It certainly isn’t somethingthat’s one could actually use.
 But why did Mizuki…?
 I don’t know the details
 but it must be that Mizukiand Orochimaru
 had a point of contact in the past…
 However…
 That tie has already been severed.
 Yes, unfortunately Orochimarujust used him as a plaything.
 Giving him an unusable drug…he’s probably laughing his butt off.
 But Mizuki is one lucky guy…
 An ordinary Shinobi wouldhave lost his life.
 Although he won’t be able to livehis life as a Shinobi any more.
 Unfortunate, isn’t it, Naruto?
 I kind of had that feeling anyway…
 I see.
 But I won’t give up!
 I will continue to do my best to searchfor clues to Sasuke’s whereabouts.
 Tsubaki…
 Damn it, Iruka!
 Don’t talk!
 Next time I’ll take you and thatlittle squirt down without fail.
 There’s no way youcould do that.
 While you were pursuingyour futile dream,
 Naruto’s been actively honinghis skills.
 You can’t possibly catch upwith him any longer.
 Mizuki can never go backto being a Shinobi again…
 Tsubaki…
 I’m thinking of starting overagain too…
 But first I must atone forall the trouble I caused the village…
 What a beautiful sunset.
 Let’s return to the village.
 Dried and Canned Goods
 Fish Market
 I won't…
 ever give up either!
 I did it!
 All right, since everybodyworked so hard today,
 I’m going to do something specialand treat you all to a meal at Ichiraku.
 Yippee! You’re a real man,lruka Sensei!
 I want a block of barbecued pork!
 I want large portions ofall three kinds of ramen noodles –
 miso, soy sauce and butter!
 Hey, Iruka, before you do that,
 you and Naruto need to goto Leaf Village Hospital.
 Huh…I told you I’m okay.
 Don’t argue with me.
 Lady Tsunade!
 I cleared the first stage!
 She’s just started herascetic training…
 Could she be an exceptional talenton par with Shizune…?
 Hey, Sakura…!
 This time you saved me…
 You’ve really become stronger,haven’t you, Naruto.
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 I can't stand it any longer!
 No matter how long I wait, there's no clue about Sasuke's whereabouts!
 And yet, Old Lady Tsunade keepstelling me not to do a thing!
 At this rate, we'll never find Sasuke!
 Isn't there anything?
 Something, anything...a clue to finding Sasuke!

 The match goes on until one of youdies or admits defeat.
 When it’s determined thatthere’s a winner,
 the match can be stopped.
 But that’s my decision.
 Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!
 Hey Guy! You too, Lee…
 Is your body all right?
 Kakashi!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Oh! Sorry, sorry.
 You must’ve been worried.Sorry for not contacting you at all…
 Oh no, Sakura’s gonna get really mad…
 I don’t really mind that.
 It's hard to see from here…
 Sasuke…
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Hm?
 You know about the markon Sasuke’s neck, don’t you?
 Is that…?
 No need to worry.
 A mark?
 So, that’s that.
 Yup!
 One…
 Two…
 Three…
 Four…
 Five…
 Six…
 Seven…
 Eight.
 Eight of them…
 There are eight members ofAnbu Black Ops in this spacious arena…
 Two platoons are too few…
 What’s Lord Hokage thinking?
 Well…without knowing how or whenthe opponent would make their move…
 It can’t be helped that the Anbuare dispersed and deployed
 in important areas in the village.
 Huh?
 It’s about to begin.
 We shouldn’t let our guard down,but for now…
 We need to pay attention… to this match.
 Kakashi, I’ll be carefully checking outwhat sort of training you gave him…
 as your eternal rival!
 Huh? Did you say something?
 No! You’re slick, Kakashi!
 Why are you always so avant-garde?!
 Both of you, to the middle!
 Begin!
 So this is the sandKakashi told me about…
 Please don’t get so mad…
 Mother…
 What’s he talking about…?
 Earlier… Earlier I had you suckawful-tasting blood.
 I’m sorry.
 But this time it’ll likely…
 taste good.
 His conversation’s started.This is dangerous.
 This is the first time I’ve seen Gaaraget like that before fighting.
 So it must mean his opponentis that imposing…
 Him.
 It appears he’s calmed down.
 Come on.
 Hey…
 Do you remember…what he said yesterday?
 At that time…
 I will kill…you all without fail.
 Just wait.
 That’s what he said…
 But he didn’t do it.
 It was the perfect opportunity, but…
 he didn’t even see us.
 Now, let me feel it!
 We're…
 unsatisfactory for him.
 Right now, the only one whocan make him feel anything…
 …is only Sasuke!
 I live fighting for only myselfand loving myself…
 And if I see that all other peoplein this world
 exist only to make me realize that,
 there could be no world more wonderful.
 Naruto…
 Here we go!
 The Sand Shield becamea Sand Clone!
 He’s fast! This guy…is just like that guy…
 He’s fast! It’s nearly the sameas Lee’s ordinary speed.
 And…
 It's overlapping with the image…
 of my Taijutsu!
 Is that the Sand Armor?
 Come on!
 Thank you, Anbu man.
 So apparently, Hinata will beall right for now if she rests.
 Oh, is that right?
 Huh? You know this person?What‘re you taking about?
 This person is an Anbu…
 Not that, but at the examination…?What do you mean?
 Well, this is what it means…
 Come on!
 If you’re not gonna come at me,I’ll go at you!
 He’s fast!
 What’s the matter? Is that it?
 A-Amazing…
 That armor…I’ll tear it off.
 His speed is basically the sameas Lee’s with the weights removed.
 It’s… It’s exactly likeLee’s Taijutsu.
 His speed is also completelydifferent from before!
 Sasuke… You are indeeda genius beyond imagination.
 How many years did it take meto attain that speed…?
 And you attained it in a mere month…!
 However, it seems to consumea lot of stamina
 to continue that movement.
 What’s Gaara planning to do?
 The sand armor uses up toomuch Chakra…
 It can’t last for very long.
 What the heck sort of trainingdid you do?!
 Hm?
 To get to that level in a mere month…
 Sasuke had copied Lee’s Taijutsuwith Sharingan.
 So during the Taijutsu training…
 I had Sasuke image Lee’s movements.
 Sasuke could makethat movement his own
 only because he knew Lee.
 Of course, Sasuke had towork very hard for it.
 But…with only that…
 With only Taijutsu…that Sand guy can’t be taken down!
 That Kakashi…
 He must have seen the battle
 between the hateful Gaaraand the lovable Lee.
 Taijutsu that was taught suddenly
 can’t work against an opponentthat even Lee couldn’t take down.
 He should have known this only to well.
 So if that’s the case…
 Why is it that he had Sasukemaster only Taijutsu?!
 Why did I keep living?
 But as long as you’re alive,you need a reason…
 If you don’t have one,it’s just the same as being dead.
 What's this guy saying?!
 So this is the answer I came to…
 I am living in order to killhuman beings other than myself.
 After living in the fear of never knowingwhen I might be murdered,
 finally, I became calm.
 Oh?
 Shikamaru…
 We need to go over to whereKakashi Sensei is right now!
 What’re you planning to do?
 Hey!
 I'm going to…
 stop this match!
 Gaara couldn’t possibly be planningto use that Jutsu!
 So he used all the sand for protection…
 I didn’t think there could be thismuch of a difference in the hardness
 with a difference in the densityof the sand.
 So it’s absolute protection.
 The sand…lt’s covered his entire body.
 This is somewhat troublesome.
 Now, how will Sasuke proceed?!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Naruto!
 Huh? What do you want?
 Sensei!Please stop this match right away!
 That guy is totally different from us!
 He’s not normal!
 Naruto… 					What’re you saying?
 He lives to kill people.
 In any case…
 If this continues, Sasuke will die!
 Jin, Saru,
 Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, Saru…
 There’s no mistake about it.lt’s that Jutsu!
 This isn’t good!Our plan isn’t even on Gaara’s mind.
 Shoot!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Everyone makes mistakeslt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
 So many regretsDon’t let this scar be for naught

 Forge on strong
 Sasuke, when I fought you once, I said
 Even if one understands visually,
 it's meaninless unless onecan move physically.
 I was filled witha sense of superiority.
 But now, you have a body that movesat the same high speed as mine.
 Moreover, you have…Sharingan!

 Grandma Sansho, the curry of life!
 One…
 Two!
 I'll look after Lee.
 So give Neji and Narutosome curry!
 Ranmaru, wait here.
 Right.
 I’m going to Naruto!Please look after Lee.
 You too, get your butt to Neji!
 Oh… right, Mom.
 Right… Open Lee’s mouth.
 Oh, right!
 Here!
 So even the curry of lifewon’t work, huh…?
 Oh my!
 Oh my…
 You little--! This isn’t the timeto be passing out!
 Hot!
 What’re you doing, believe it?!
 Are you awake?
 Oh, Tenten?Didn’t you fall off the cliff?!
 You should’ve realizedthat was his trap!
 What?! I was totally snow-jobbed,believe it!
 Neji, Neji!
 It’s the curry of life!Eat this and get better.
 Neji?!
 Neji!
 Oh my, thank goodness he got better!
 What?
 The world is spinning…
 He’s acting kind of strange…
 Oh my…
 One, two…
 Put the curry of life in this,pot and all.
 Okay.
 Hot!
 Oww!
 Oh! The curry…
 This is bad!
 Don’t worry about it. Move it!
 On account of that wine…
 Will he be okay?
 Oh my, there’s a slight problemwith the ingredients…
 But there shouldn’t bemuch difference in efficacy.
 But…
 Oh my…!
 He’s coming this way.
 It’s okay! I’ll go…
 You’re still alive?!I have to finish you off…
 Raiga…
 You’re alive, Ranmaru?!
 It’s Ranmaru!
 That kid gave Raiga his own Chakraand brought him back to life…
 What?!
 Raiga looked at Ranmaruwho was unconscious
 and assumed he was dead…
 So that’s why he was sayingall that gibberish
 about Ranmaru watchingfrom high above.
 And I managed to get Ranmaruto the Curry of Life Shop.
 So that’s what happened…
 We’ll again be together forever,Ranmaru…
 Let’s kill them and have fundoing lots of bad things.
 Right, Raiga…
 Some fog has appeared.
 It’s okay.I’ll be your eyes again, Raiga…
 Right. There’s nothing to be afraid ofif I’m with you, Ranmaru.
 Now, let’s go, Raiga!
 What about them?
 They’re dead now…
 Right…Shall we searchfor our next prey?
 But there’s a precipitous cliff ahead!
 That Ranmaru, what’s he going to do?!
 Could it be…
 he’s going to atone for the past sinstogether with Raiga?!
 He might be planning to lead Raigaover that cliff and die together!
 Wh-What?!
 What’s with you, jerk?!
 What?!
 Lee…
 Hey…
 Here I go…!
 What?!
 You…brat!
 He suddenly recovered!
 Knock it off!
 He’s fast!
 You okay, Ranmaru?
 You stay here!
 Take me with you…
 Oh! Ranmaru!
 Where’d you go, Ranmaru?!
 You little--! You’re going to pay for this!
 Ninja Art: Thunder Armor!
 Now…
 Bring it!
 Knock it off!
 Here I go…
 That was a heck of a blow.
 If I hadn’t put on the Thunder Armor;I’d be giving myself a funeral.
 In order to remember your hard workI’ll give you your funeral myself!
 Wait!
 What’s the idea…?
 I want to feed you…the curry of life, too.
 Huh?!
 You’ll realize that you’re not aloneif you eat the curry…
 Everyone’s feelings are blended in…
 What’re you saying?!
 Let’s stop hurting people…

 I must give you a funeral!
 Stop…Raiga!

 Eat this and get it together!We’ve got trouble here!
 That’s…
 What?!
 Now we’ve done it…
 You’re going to kill by your own handthe friend who risked his life to save you?!
 Wha--?! Ranmaru betrayed me…
 He broke the promise for itto be just us two forever!
 He’s not all alone anymore!
 He figured out that it’s more fun…
 to laugh with everyonethan to cry with you!
 Naruto…
 Ranmaru, you were going to diewith Raiga, weren’t you?!
 Don’t be thinking aboutsomething like that anymore!
 You’re free now!
 Don't worry. I won’t let Raigagive you a funeral, no matter what!
 Hey, don’t be shooting off your mouth,you shrimp.
 Say what?!
 Don’t underestimate me.I’m Raiga Kurosuki!
 I’ve been counted before as one ofthe Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
 I won’t take orders fromthe likes of you!
 Oh. That’s right.He’s a Ninja Swordsman, huh?
 If you’re one of the Seven Ninja SwordsMen of the Mist,
 then I’ve got something to ask you.
 You know the guy called Kisame, right?!
 Kisame? I hate that guy!
 So I’ll give him a funeral for surethe next time I see him!
 What?!
 I hate him.
 I hate all the Seven Ninja SwordsMen of the Mist!
 Ranmaru. You’re the only onewho’s a friend to me…
 But Ranmaru…you’ve made other friends…
 We’re not two in one anymore…
 Raiga…
 Impudent!
 Who do you think taught youabout the outside world?!
 It’s a funeral for you!
 Clone Spinning Axe Kick!
 You little…
 Clone… Body Slam!
 Ranmaru…
 Now you're free…
 Raiga?!
 Thunder! Give me my funeral!
 One, two… One…
 Not loud enough!
 – You can’t make genuine curry of life…– One, two…
 – if you don’t stir it with all your heart!– One, two…
 Oh my!
 Ouch… What’re you doing, Mom?!
 Oh my, Karashi!
 It’s a hundred years too soon for youto be uttering the word ""genuine""!
 You too, start your training over againfrom the beginning!
 What?!
 Grandma Sansho!
 We’ll be leaving now!
 Thanks for your help.
 I leave Ranmaru to you!
 Oh my… I’ll train him mercilesslyas a successor…
 to the preparation of the curry of life!
 Good luck, Ranmaru, Karashi.
 – Thanks! 					– Thanks!
 Oh my… It’s a long wayto the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 I made you guys some special curry
 that’ll give you guys ten thousand timesthe strength.
 Be on your way after having some.
 What’s this very spicy-lookingbright red color…?
 It kind of hurts my eyes, believe it!
 Oh! That looks good!
 – What? Seriously?!– What? Seriously?!
 Lady Tsunade will get mad at usif we don’t get back soon!
 You're right!
 Unfortunately, we’ll have to be going now.
 Wait!
 Oh my, those kids were surediffident and reserved…
 The curry… The curry…!
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 One’s duty as team captain:
 ""Issue appropriate instructionsto the subordinates,

 Awesome, that is so cool!
 This is so perfect for me, Naruto, the manwho will eventually become a Hokage!
 All right, I’ll use this to instantly get closerto the title of Hokage, believe it!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart

 It will reach you, without a doubt

 Hey… Closet pervert.
 Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu…
 One Thousand Years of Death!
 He’s totally knocked out…He’s weak, sure enough.
 What’s with that big frog?What the heck are you?
 Thank you for asking me!
 Know me as the Mountain Toad…spirit sage who acquires immortality,
 also commonly called theToad Mountain Sage.
 Long Time No See:Jiraiya Returns!
 M-Mountain Sage?
 Exactly.
 Hey…Pervy Sage,what’re you going to do about this?
 Here, he was supposed towatch my training.
 You did that to him.
 He interfered with my research.
 Research?
 I’m a writer.I’m writing a novel.
 This is it.
 Make-Out Paradise
 Oh, that is…!
 You know this?
 I’ve gotten quite famous.
 That’s not much of a novel!
 In the first place,what research you are talking about?
 You’re just peeking at the girls’ bath!
 – Yikes! 					– No!
 Idiot, idiot…idiot!My peeking has been found out.
 You pervert.
 F-Fool! I’m not just a pervert.
 I get inspired by peekingand can write better pieces.
 Liar! No excuses.
 More importantly, what’re yougoing to do about my training?
 You mean the walking-on-water techniqueyou were doing earlier?
 You know it?
 Then take responsibilityand join my training.
 Humph. I don’t care about such things.
 Hey, hey wait, Pervy Sage!
 Join my training, hey!
 Shut up! I hate people whodon’t know how to talk properly…
 And I don’t like men.
 Oh, umm, umm…
 That Make-Out Paradise wasreally exciting, cool and interesting.
 The purchase or viewing of that novel isprohibited for those 18 years or younger…
 You liar.
 The reviews that I‘ve heard are great.
 It’s useless to flatter me.I’m a sage!
 I’m not the type of fool who canbe coaxed by a fledgling like you.
 Oh, hey…wait!
 Farewell, kid.
 Wow! He’s cool eventhough he’s a pervert.
 Heeey, Pervy Sage!
 Where’d he go?
 What’re you doing,you old pervert?
 No, no, I’m sorry, miss…but what lovely breasts…
 Pervert!
 This grown-up is disgraceful.
 Maybe there’s nothing special about him,after all.
 But there’s nobody else.
 Good grief…
 As usual, the women inthis village are strong-minded.
 However, that’s makes them so good.
 “As usual”?Meaning you’ve come here before?
 You.
 And you did nothing but peeping, right…?
 You Pervy Sage!
 Don’t say pervert, pervertin such a loud voice.
 Shut up!
 So I bet that one shot onthe closet pervert was a fluke…
 Anyway, I’ll have you take responsibilityfor ruining my training! Whoa…
 Jeez, you’re a noisy brat.
 Hey!
 Be quiet inside here for awhile.
 Hey! Let me out, you jerk!
 I want to have a romantic encounterwith a stacked girl.
 How dare you do that to me earlier!
 Substitution Jutsu.
 Sure enough,he’s not an ordinary old man.
 Humph! That punk…
 It’s a million years too soonfor that kid to take me on.
 Not really.
 It seems you have a bit of talent.
 Then you’ll watch my training?
 Give and take!
 I'm not averse to listeningto your favor
 as long as you listen to mine.
 So which is it?
 Listen up…
 Nice ripe fruit that looks like this,like this and this.
 I’ll watch your trainingif you bring me that.
 You really will, right?
 This Toad Mountain Sage doesn’t lie.
 Okay, wait!
 Plans are plans.They don't necessarily have to happen…
 Hello there, you ladies!
 Oh my… You’re funny, old man.
 No-no, this is the solemn truth.
 Yeah, and then,what happened then?
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 Oh no! Pervy Sage, he said.
 You fool! Who’s a Pervy Sage?
 I brought the promised item.
 Nice ripe fruit..
 Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot!That’s not IT!
 Looks good!
 Don't hesitate. Help yourself.
 Thanks.
 No!
 Where’d the ladies go?!
 I got my fill…
 Ladies…
 No doubt about it. That person is…
 Good grief. I’ve wasted time…
 Hold it! Where are you going?!What about my training?!
 I don’t care! My precious researchhas been ruined thanks to you.
 Research, my butt!I can’t be standing around here, either!
 I’m going to train hard,become stronger than anybody,
 pass the Chunin exam,
 and then I’ll exceed the Hokage!
 Humph! I don’t care about such things.
 Here all you do is get in my way…
 Jeez, what a repugnant brat!
 Stacked girls like the onesfrom earlier
 are indispensable formy great writing enterprises!
 I see… So I should bringsome stacked girls, right?
 Okay.
 W-Wow…!
 If you gaze at me like that…I feel embarrassed.
 Oh…!
 What a…
 What a cute girl.
 I like you!
 You pass!
 Idiot.
 You’re really my type of girl.What’s that technique called?
 It’s called Sexy Jutsu.
 Oooh, what an idea. You’re a genius.
 I get the feeling all adults arereally affected by this technique.
 Then you’ll watch my training?
 Sure! However, I have a condition.
 A condition…? What is it?
 A-Always be…in that formwhen you’re in front of me!
 Hey! Sure enough,you’re just a pervert! You Pervy Sage!
 No! I’m not just a pervert!
 As if you didn’t know!
 I’m a super pervert!
 Darn it… He’s gone defiant…
 Well, brushing off the stuff untilnow as a joke,
 I’ll watch your training.
 You mean it, right?
 A sage doesn’t go back on his word.
 Okay, kid.
 Do that training that you weredoing before one more time.
 Okay!
 Okay.
 Darn it.
 Totally worthless.
 Shut up!
 It’s pointless to wear clothes.
 Hey, build up your Chakraone more time.
 One more time?
 Just do it, quick.
 You!
 What?
 You’re pretty sexy whenyou’re naked.
 Jeez. I’m concentrating,so don’t interfere.
 Oh, sorry, sorry. Continue.
 You’re messing with my focus.
 I see…So this is The Seal Formula.
 Two Tetragram Sealsmaking a Double Tetragram Seal…
 Is this an 8-Signed Seal Formula?
 Nine-Tailed Chakra is leakingfrom between the Tetragram Seals…
 and is fixed so that itcan return to this kid’s Chakra.
 Fourth Hokage…
 It’s to protect this kid, huh?
 But after that, it’s stoppedwith a Five-Pronged Seal…
 Putting Odd-Numbered Sealover Even-Number Seals…
 This kid’s Chakra and that ofthe Nine-Tailed are discreetly intermingled
 and are not stable.
 No wonder he is not able tobuild up Chakra very well.
 That tickles…old man.
 Oh, sorry, sorry.
 Perhaps someone else…did it…
 The formula is rough.
 Well, it’s probably Orochimaru.
 Kid, give me a hurrah.
 What?
 Just hurrah. Come on, hurrah.
 Jeez, he’s demanding.
 Five-Pronged Seal…Release!
 What’re you doing?!
 Well, I just pushedthe pressure points for relaxing.
 Just try walking onthe water once more…
 Sheesh!
 What?
 I don’t know why, but it’s going well!
 Yahoo!
 I guess it’s about time to teach himhow to control the Nine-Tailed Chakra.
 Okay, kid. Come on out.
 I’ll teach you an ace technique.
 What, what ace technique?A deadly technique?
 There’s something you need tounderstand well
 before I teach you techniques.
 You probably haven’t noticed,but you possess two types of Chakra.
 Huh? Two types?
 Until now, have you everfelt a special Chakra?
 Special? Hmm…
 Come to think of it…
 Come to think of it,I get the feeling there were times when…
 Chakra suddenly sprang upand an awesome power came out.
 But…I don’t really remember those moments.
 I see.
 But I do remember sensing thatit was different
 from the Chakra I always build up.
 If I liken it to colors,
 while it’s always blue…
 it felt like it was red or something.
 I see.
 Okay. That’s it for today’s training.
 What?! Already?
 What happened to the ace technique?
 I can still train.
 With training, a watched pot never boils.
 As long as we’re here,let’s have a bath…
 Not just falling in…
 Warms me up.
 A drink after training’s the best.
 Say, say, Pervy Sage.
 What kind of technique isthat ace technique?
 You’ll find out tomorrow.
 Miser!
 We’ll turn into boiled frogs ifwe stay in here too long.
 Ebisu, sorry for snatchingyour student.
 It’s okay. More importantly,I was surprised…
 The Hokage has had us searchingall over for you
 and we could never determineyour whereabouts.
 To think you were in this village…
 The Hokage will be pleased.
 Did you tell the Third Hokage about me?
 Not yet.
 I see. That’s for the best.
 Sure enough, somethingabout Orochimaru?
 No, unfortunately not.
 What?
 I just stopped by lookingfor material for my novel…
 My nature is not to get myselfinvolved in trouble.
 What are you saying?!You should know!
 What is necessary to stop Orochimaru,known as one of the Sannin,
 the legendary three Shinobi,
 is the power of another Sannin!
 Your power, Master Jiraiya!
 First, I need to sign this contract
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

 First, I need to sign this contractin blood
 and mark it with the fingerprintsof one hand.
 Then I build up my Chakra.
 The Hand Signs areDog-Boar-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.
 Then I must place my contract handon the place where I want to summon it!

 Arm!
 Where did that bird go?
 Damn it! We lost it!
 Over there!
 Just a little more…
 This is a mission believe it or not!
 This is something very important…
 I beg you…Please let go of it!
 We have trouble, Lady Tsunade!
 What is it?!
 Those papersscattered throughout the village,
 are the plans that were stolenfrom the carpenter boss.
 Currently, Shikamaru and his teamhave finished collecting all the plans,
 and rechecking them.
 But it seems like they havecollected all of them.
 What is the meaning of this?
 I have no idea…
 Lady Tsunade! We have a report
 from those who headed tothe Hidden Waterfall Village!
 Was there movement?!
 Actually, it turns out that it was onlya large-scale practice run!
 They are saying that they seeno signs of an invasion of Leaf Village.
 What?!
 It seems as though they havealready finished their practice run,
 and the Hidden Waterfall Villageis back to normal.
 So Genno and Hidden Waterfall Villagehave nothing to do with each other…?
 Disengage the S-LevelEmergency Security Alert!
 Order all forces back to village!
 Yes!
 What in the worldwas that man plotting?!
 Lady Tsunade!
 What now?!
 The body thatthe Anbu Black-Ops gathered…
 It's…
 It’s not Genno…?
 What does that mean?
 But I thought that Old Man Genno wascornered by the Anbu Black Ops
 and blew himself up.
 He traded places with a corpse thathe had ready right before the explosion…
 That’s a huge possibility!
 We’re in the middle of confirming that!
 Their appearances look similar,but small details bring up questions!
 Most likely…it’s another man.
 Are you telling mehe fooled the Anbu Black Ops!
 That means, Genno is…
 He’s still alive!
 Damn! What is that man up to…?
 Over there.Behind that tree.
 It’s here!
 I see… The Old Man Genno usedthis hole to get away.
 He camouflaged it well.
 If it wasn’t for the Byakugan,we would have missed it.
 Not only that…
 This hole is made so that it closesnaturally by the weight of the earth.
 If we came here another day later,
 it would have beenextremely difficult to find,
 even with the Byakugan.
 And to prove that,
 you can barely see any sign ofan entrance to this hole.
 Akamaru, can you follow his scent?
 He’s even got getting rid ofhis smell covered…
 Where could he have gone?
 Our conclusion is that…
 Old Man Genno is still alive
 and there's a possibility thathe's hiding in Leaf Village.
 He got cornered,and faked his own suicide,
 and stole the plans so that he could…
 make all of us turn our eyes outsideof the village.
 He could have already knownabout the big practice run
 in the Hidden Waterfall Villageand used that to his advantage.
 B-But the Anbu Black Opsstarted to mark Genno because
 they happened to find out that his letterof recommendation was a fake, right?
 Was it a coincident…?
 Isn’t it strange thata real letter of recommendation was
 at the house of the carpenter bosshe worked for?
 Then what is his true goal?
 If we knew the answer to that,we wouldn’t be struggling so much…
 Shikamaru!
 The only thing I can say now is…
 The number of Shinobi in this villagecurrently is at its lowest ever.
 We only have a bare minimumof us here!
 And most of their eyes arelooking outside of the village.
 Even if Genno was walking aroundas he was humming on the streets,
 no one would suspect anything of him.
 Did he set a trap in the village?!
 Could the fact that thathe scattered the plans around mean that
 he’s already done setting his trap?
 No, this is just a diversion to turn our eyes.
 We can’t leave this placewithout any security,
 but we have few people…
 Then where do we look?
 The Academy.
 The Academy?
 Why the Academy out of allthe important facilities in the village?
 Out of all the sites Genno worked on,
 only the Academy’s repair planwas stolen.
 It’s hard to think thatit was a coincidence
 for it to disappear at this timing.
 Byakugan!
 Well?
 There’s nothing in this room.
 Then…move ahead to the next room.
 Byakugan!
 Seems like there’s nothing in this area
 Can’t you look atthe entire campus at once?
 And we have Hinata too, you know?
 That would be possibleif we know what the target was,
 but we’re looking forsomething suspicious.
 We’ll have to take the basic route.
 Hey! Wait a minute!
 You’re in the way!
 And there’s too many… people here.
 Like I said!
 All I want is for you guys to come outsideeven just for a moment!
 Our teacher told us to study on our ownin the classroom for today!
 We can’t go out of the room!
 There are no teachers today!
 So nobody would knowif you left the class!
 We used to skip class whenlruka Sensei wasn’t looking
 when we were younger.
 Oh! A delinquent!
 – Delinquent! 					– Delinquent!
 We have to check this area!
 Besides, all the teachers have goneon a mission to protect the village.
 Why are you guys still here?
 They must be useless.
 What did you say?!We’re also protecting the village too…
 Naruto. You’re wasting time
 Let’s crush them!
 What?
 The Expansion Jutsu!
 We’re going to tell on you to our teacher!
 Yeah, do as you please!
 Idiot!
 Let’s practice our Kunai Knives.
 Sounds good.
 It doesn’t seem likethere’s anything suspicious…
 Hurry up!
 Wait!
 Come on.I’m begging you to leave!
 Naruto!
 Where did those kids fromthe next classroom go?
 I don’t know…
 They were going to practicetheir Kunai Knives.
 That’s what they were saying.
 Oh, yeah, yeah.That’s right.
 They’re practicing their Kunai Knivesin a place like that?
 I’ll do next.
 Ok. Do your best!
 Do it!
 Yeah!
 Oh, so close.
 They really are practicing…
 When we werestudents at the Academy,
 we used to skip class and come here.
 The teacher’s couldn’t find us here,it really was great!
 I read comic books, and took naps…
 That’s right, I ate potato chips.
 Well, that’s no good!
 You can learn something from those kids.
 Even if the teachers doesn’t see you,
 you should still commit to your practice!
 They’re true models of students!
 Wonderful!I’m excited! I’m moved!
 I’d like to take class with them!
 We wouldn’t want to interrupt.Let’s go.
 Yeah…
 Naruto…
 What?
 Did they have that before?
 I’m going to get this one!
 Ouch!
 I had it!
 It seems pretty new.
 Genno could have made it…
 I-I’m going to get Neji or Hinata!
 You guys get out of the way.
 You’re getting in the way of our practice.
 O-Oh I’m sorry!
 I’m next!
 Byakugan!
 It’s a Paper Bomb!lt’s hidden behind the wall!
 What, inside the wall?!
 It’s completely hidden inside the wall.
 But then how do youdetonate it…?
 Oh, there she is.
 Hey! Hinata!
 Naruto.
 Naruto…
 Hinata, go out with me!
 Wh-What are you sayingat a time like this?!
 Huh?
 I-I don't know… Go out with you?
 You won’t?
 I-I’m not necessarily saying no…
 Then I’ll just ask Neji then.See you later!
 What?
 There’s a thin thread attachedto the Paper Bomb.
 A thread?
 It’s probably a special threadused to ignite it.
 He's probably is going to detonate itfrom a distance…
 Where is that thread connected to?!
 It goes around the classroom and…
 It goes outside…towards the training hall…?
 There’s a log standing…
 This… Could it be?!
 Neji! Come with me for a second!
 What is it!We’re in the middle of something…
 Actually there’s a strange log standingin the training hall over there.
 We wanted him to check it.
 That’s the triggering device!
 Huh?
 Try loosening up your shouldersand then throw it.
 Shut up.
 All right, I’m up next.
 There should be a target on the log.
 Yeah, there is.
 The center of the targetis the triggering device!
 When a Kunai Knife hits the center…
 the device will activate…
 And the Academy will explode!
 So close!
 If you focus, you’ll hit the target.
 All right, I’m going to hit this time.
 Focus…
 And target!
 Don’t let anybody hit the target!
 All right, I hit the target!
 You did it!
 Oh?
 The tip is cracked.You always have to take care of your tools.
 Damn, I thought that I hit the target.
 This way! Behind there!
 All right…I’m going to hit it for sure!
 That’s the spirit!
 This looks good!
 This time I’m going to hit it!
 Bushy Brow!
 Stop it, Lee!
 What?
 Oh, did I scare you?
 I’m sorry. I just dropped my Ninja tool…Here.
 Bushy Brow, you did it!
 I had the target!
 Why did you get in the way?!
 Be quiet!lf that had hit the target,
 the Academy would have exploded!
 What…?
 For real?
 A triggering device in here…huh?
 When something hits the center,the Academy explodes.
 So there hasn’t been anyonewho’s been able to hit the center.
 We really were lucky.
 We were lucky, huh?
 So who started to practicethrowing their Kunai-Knife here?
 Who? Who was it?
 Somebody told us that we'd be praised
 if we got better at Kunai-Knife throwingin secret from the teachers.
 ""in secret from from the teachers…""
 Whoever must’ve used Genjutsuto make them think that.
 It must be Genno.
 What happened?
 W-Well… There's more than one threadcoming out of the triggering device.
 Is that true Hinata?
 Yeah…
 Byakugan!
 True.There's not just one…two…no, three?
 Where are they connected to?
 Outside of the academy… 					No!
 Wait! It’s hard to see from here.
 U-Umm… M-Me too…
 Byakugan!
 Byakugan!
 I found one.
 I found one, too
 Tell us the location.
 No, wait.The thread splits again.
 Over here too…
 Th-This is…
 No…way…
 It can't be…
 Hey! What’s the matter!
 There’s Paper Bombs plantedall over the village!
 It’s not just 10 or 20…
 It's countless numbers of them!
 What?!
 The Village Hidden in the Leavesis a nest of Paper Bombs!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say,“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!!Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stagedoes bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feelin my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s fromthat coke I just drank?
 – Now, the Academy is safe.– All right!
 It’s too early to feel relieved.
 If he realizes the Paper Bombsare being deactivated,
 he might blow up the villageby a different method.
 Then we have to evacuateeveryone quickly!
 – Then he'll know what we're doing!– That means…
 Pretend we don’t notice anythingand get rid of the Paper Bombs.
 Everyone, get to it at once!
 – Yeah! 					– Yes.

 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 The Enemy of the Byakugan
 They blew up…They blew up and died!
 As I expected, I’m not sad.
 You really can’t hold funeralsfeeling like this, huh…
 Four of them are still alive.
 Can’t be! After being hitby my Lightning Fang…
 No…
 If you say so, it has to be true.
 One…is troublesome…
 The enemy was nearby…But I couldn’t see anything.
 It’s strange…
 Even if it’s the Hidden Mist Jutsu,
 my Byakugan should be ableto see through it.
 Byakugan!
 For sure this time…
 I can see it!
 Southwest 52 degrees 2!
 Southeast 12 degrees 3!
 Southeast 8 degrees 1!
 Northwest 24 degrees 11!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Let’s go!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 No way!
 Why?!
 U-zu-ma-ki Barrage!
 I missed!
 H-Help me!
 Bushy Brow…?
 Th-The enemy disappeared!
 It can’t be…The false images with Chakra Networks?
 One at the middle of the cliff,one at the bottom of the cliff,
 one on the right, one on the left.
 We can’t hold funerals,
 but I’ll take care of themwithout leaving any trace.
 Thunder Funeral: Feast of Lightning!
 The corpses are warm.
 We’re strong…you and I.
 No, it’s you.
 Ranmaru, you’re strong.With you I’m also strong.
 Wait… They aren’t dead yet.They’re just unconscious.
 They’re stubborn.
 Okay, if grilling doesn’t work,then let’s chop them.
 Flesh and even bone…I’ll crush them nicely.
 Ranmaru…! Are you all right?!
 Hang in there, Ranmaru!
 Ranmaru…!
 I’m okay.
 Raiga…
 This person…is still unconscious.
 What did you say?
 It’s amazing…
 He is fightingonly with muscle memory.
 It’s a nice face.lt burns into my heart.
 Let’s hold a funeral for him…
 I am sure it will be onethat will make me cry!
 From the right!
 What’s with this guy…?
 He’s hard to read. The moves…
 But for your sake, Raiga,I’ll do my best.
 Together, okay!
 Left!
 Right!
 From the front! Jump! Now!
 You…you…you!
 What?
 How can this guy…get to this point?
 B-Bushy Brows…
 Lee…Could he have lost consciousness…?
 Tenten! Neji!
 Raiga! Turn around!
 What…? That voice right now…?
 Wha–?!
 Raiga!
 Ranmaru!
 This is…
 Neji…
 Ranmaru!
 Move!
 Huh? Somehow…it felt likeI was fighting in my dreams…
 Ranmaru…
 You!
 Heh! Naruto Uzumaki arrives!
 Naruto…
 Just die already…
 Hey! I have somethingI want to ask you!
 You… I heard you’re one ofthe Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
 So what if I was?!
 You know Zabuza, right?!
 You also know…one called Kisame, right?!
 I…hate them!Who wants to remember them?!
 I hate you too!
 Then!
 I’ll make you tell me by force!
 A clone?!
 You… You’re weakerthan a moment ago.
 Wh-What…?
 Lightning Ball!
 Damn…
 Huh, you are tough…
 Lightning Ball!
 Seconds, please…
 Grandma Sansho?
 What’s wrong?
 Oh my. That’s bad lightning.
 It was flashing like that too whenKarashi went to the village.
 Oh my…that light is like poison…
 Naruto!
 It’s not…working at all.
 I’m not going toremember your smile!
 Die!
 Ranmaru…where are you?
 What is in this bag…?
 Byakugan!
 There’s…in here…
 Could it be?
 This powder was…hiding the Chakra Networks?
 It’s even creating the Chakra Network!
 Naruto!Do the Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 But he saw all the shadow clones…
 Don’t worry.His eyes are right here!
 Ranmaru! I’m gonna come save youafter I defeat this guy!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Come bring it on!
 Lightning Ball!
 What? Was the one before a lucky hit?
 Stop messing around.All I have to do is defeat you all, right?!
 Let’s go!
 We’re not done yet!
 You…
 At this rate…my Chakra will…
 The mist…The Hidden Mist Jutsu is fading away…
 Damn! I’ll finish them off at once!
 Damn!
 I am not going to let you get away!
 Wait!
 Ninja Art: Boulder Avalanche.
 Naruto!
 Naruto…
 Did you see that…?!
 Yeah, I saw it!
 Prepare yourself!
 Stop it!
 I can’t stop!
 I…did it.
 This is…Raiga’s eye…?
 Such a big eye ball!
 Huh?
 You’re wrong…lt’s a human being!
 Huh…?!
 In my dream…
 I guess you were the oneI was fighting against.
 It wasn’t me…lt was Raiga and me together…
 Together…?
 Always…since that time…
 Don’t act like you’re asleep.You are going to die…
 Don’t move!
 There is a spy in this villagewho snuck into the Hidden Mist Village…
 We came to kill those guys, but…
 I got confused about who I had to kill.That’s why I am doing it randomly…
 Wh-What are you saying?
 It’s fine…lf I am going to be killed by you.
 Huh…?Why is it fine for me to kill you…?
 You were…always crying…
 Huh? Me…cry?
 In your heart…seeking the meaning of living.
 I was always watching…you.
 What…are you?
 I am the same as you…living is painful.
 I don’t understandthe meaning of living.
 Because of my sickness,I couldn’t go outside…
 Shunned by everyone,
 all I could do was to takea peek of the world from this blanket…
 But …if with my death,
 if you are able to feelthe meaning of life even a little…
 My life was not neededfrom the beginning.
 Please…
 Are you…alone?
 Come with me.
 From now on,you and I are two as one.
 From that day on,I became Raiga’s eyes and ears.
 Raiga became my hands and feet.
 The outside world that I dashedinto for the very first time…
 it was filled with thingsI had never seen or heard before.
 It was fun.
 Whenever and wherever,I was with Raiga.
 No matter when it was,
 there wasn’t a timethat we were separated.
 We were trying to find the meaning of lifeby living for each other.
 We were convinced thatwas the meaning to living.
 That’s why…
 If Raiga is not around,
 I no longer have the powerto live by myself.
 I’ve lost the purpose to live…
 Do you have someoneprecious to you?
 I want to protectsomeone important to me…
 I want to make his dream come true,and that’s my dream.
 Often people have it wrong…
 mistakenly believing that showing mercyto an enemy is kindness.
 They spare the foewhose life is in their hands.
 It’s not mercy to me at all…
 Do you know the agony of just livingwithout dreams and being unwanted?
 What are you saying?
 Zabuza has no use for a weak Shinobi.You’ve taken away my reason for living.
 I no longer need to live.
 Don’t say such stupid things.
 Naruto… Please kill me!
 Huh?
 What are you doing?
 Now, quickly.
 Why are you hesitating…?
 With my arms and legs torn apart,I have no means to resist, you know.
 You should carry out your mission….
 Hurry and deliver your finishing blow.
 Our mission is to force outthe Kurosuki Family from this village…
 Without Raiga, he cannot beof any threat to this village.
 The problem right now is that
 the Kurosuki Family membershave lost their leadership.
 Once the hoop comes off,we don’t know what they will do.
 For this mission…this is the finishing touch.
 Yeah, but what are wegoing to do with him?
 Is he a villain worth tying up?
 No, he is not.
 He might kill himself, right?
 Once the mission is over,we will come save you right away…
 A Chakra Sealing tag?
 We can’t help it.He is an enemy, after all…
 We should assume he has other Jutsu.Just in case!
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Rokusuke and the otherswent back to the village,
 so I say the mission is complete.
 Except Lee.
 Oh, oh yeah.
 Bushy Brow said he wasgoing to straighten Karashi’s spirit.
 I wonder if it’s going to bethat easy.
 It seems likethere will be some trouble.
 Hey, why are you saying that?!
 No, not Karashi, but this weather.

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 I see. Sakura, you've come, too.
 Now you can formally register for the Chunin Exam.
 What do you mean?
 Actually, from the start,
 only three-man squads couldapply and take the exams.
 But Sensei, you said that the decisionto take the exams
 was up to the individual.
 Yes… I said that.
 Were you lying?
 Yes, I was…
 If I said that,
 Sasuke and Naruto would probablyforcefully convince you to take it.
 Even if you didn't havethe will to apply,
 if Sasuke asks you
 you would attempt to takethe exams half-heartedly.
 For Sasuke's sake and,well, Naruto's.
 Then, if…
 it had only been Sasuke andNaruto who had come here?
 I would've stopped the Exam here.
 I wouldn't have felt like lettingthem go beyond this point.
 But…you guys came hereon your own will.
 Sakura!
 Naruto!
 And, Sasuke!
 I'm glad you came.
 You're a team I'm proud of.
 Now then, go on!
 Okay! Let's go!
 Genin Takedown!All Nine Rookies Face Off!
 W-Wow!
 W-What's with…this?
 There are so many of them…
 Could it be that they're all applicants?
 They…all look…immensely strong…
 Sasuke, you're late!
 I thought I'd be able to see youfor the first time in awhile,
 so I was waiting in excitement.
 Get away from Sasuke!lno-Pig!
 Oh, my. It's Sakura.
 Your Billboard Brow hasn't changed, eh…Ugly!
 What did you say?!
 What's up with this?
 Huh?
 Are you guys going to takethis bothersome Exam, too?
 Oh, it's the idiot trio.
 Quit calling us that!
 Man, this is a freaking bother…
 Shikamaru Nara.
 Always complaining,has no motivation.
 He's a bellyaching idiot.
 Choji Akimichi.
 He's always eating something.
 That's all he is, a fat idiot.
 Sasuke…is mine. Bleah!
 Ino Yamanaka.
 She's always fighting with Sakura.She's her rival.
 A Sasuke-crazy idiot.
 Yahoo, I found you!
 My my, everybody's here.
 H-Hello…
 Oh…
 Hinata Hyuga.
 She's a weird person who turnsher eyes away whenever I look at her!
 She's a gloomy and shy girl, I guess.
 Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru.
 They're louder than I am!
 He always brings his dog andalways has a bossy look.
 He really annoys me!
 Shino Aburame.
 As for this guy, I really don't get him!
 He's a type I'm not good with.
 What did you say?
 You guys, too?! 					 Man.
 Ha! I see.
 This means all nine Genin rookiesare taking the Exam, eh…!
 Now then…
 How far can we go?
 Eh…Sasuke?
 Hmph!…
 You're mighty confident. Kiba.
 We've trained a great deal, so...
 We won't lose to you guys!
 Shut up!
 I don't know about Sasuke,but I sure won't lose to the likes of you!
 I'm sorry. Naruto…
 Kiba didn't mean it like that…
 Huh?
 Akamaru, you've becometasty-looking…
 What?
 Don't step on it.
 Huh?
 I said, don't step on it.
 You're…gonna eat that?
 Hey, you guys!
 You should be a little quieter.
 You guys are the ""rookie nine"" …fresh out of the academy, right?
 Carrying on like thatwith cute faces…Man.
 This isn't a field trip.
 Who're you? Acting all haughty!
 I'm Kabuto Yakushi.Anyway, take a good look around you.
 Behind you…They're from the Rain Village.
 They're hot-tempered.
 Everyone's tense before the Exam.
 I thought I'd warn you guysbefore you get your butts whipped…
 I guess it can't be helped.
 You're rookies who don't knowleft from right…
 You remind me of my old self.
 You're Kabuto…right?
 Yes…
 Then, is this your second time?
 No…
 It's my seventh time.
 Huh?!
 This Exam is only held twice a year,so it's now my fourth year.
 Then that means you knowa lot about these exams?!
 Kind of…
 No kidding.Kabuto, you're pretty awesome, huh?
 But you haven't passed.
 Yeah, well, that is the case, yes…
 Is the Chunin Exam that high a hurdle?
 Man, this is utterly bothersome…
 Then, maybe I'll give a bit ofinformation to my cute juniors.
 With these Ninja Info Cards.
 Ninja Info Cards…?
 To put it simply,
 they're cards that have information burnedinto them and coded with Chakra.
 I spent four whole years gatheringinformation for this Exam.
 There are close to two hundredof these cards.
 They are pure white to the eye…
 To open the data on these cards...
 What're you doing?
 The way it works is thatno one can see the info
 without using my Chakra…
 For example…Like this…
 \Whoa, awesome!What information is this?
 The number of test-takers andparticipating nations,
 and the number of applicantsfrom each respective village
 is individually displayed.
 Why do you think that
 the Chunin Exam is jointlyconducted in the first place?
 It's said it's done to deepenfriendship among nations first
 and to boost the Shinobi levels, second.
 ""It's said""?
 That's right.
 The real aim is in the checking ofShinobi levels of neighboring nations
 and keeping power balance equal.
 Power…Equal?
 Why such bothersome things?
 If that's not done,
 the weak nations will be invaded bythe strong nations in no time at all
 and may end up beingcontrolled unilaterally.
 There's a point to mutual supervision.Probably.
 Hmph…
 Of those cards,
 are there ones withdetailed individual information?
 Yes, there are…
 Are there ones you're concerned about?
 Yes, there are!
 The information for the applicantsthis time around is not perfect,
 but is burned in and saved.
 You guys included…
 About those ""ones you'reconcerned about,"" who you know.
 Anything's fine, tell me their informationand I'll retrieve it for you.
 Gaara of the Sand Village,and Rock Lee of the Leaf Village.
 Oh, you even know names.
 That makes it quick.
 Here they are!
 Please show me.
 Here they are!
 Please show me.
 I don't really get what's going on,but I'll pretend like I do.
 Well then, first is Rock Lee.
 He's one year older than you guys.
 His mission experience,twenty D-ranks and eleven C-ranks.
 His squad leader is Guy…
 In just this year, his Taijutsuhas drastically improved, but...
 His other skills are not good at all.
 Last year, he'd attracted attention asa Genin rookie with his ability,
 but didn't participatein the Chunin Exam.
 This is his first time taking the exams,same as you guys…
 Tenten and Neji Hyuga are on his team…
 Huh? Hyuga?
 Next…is Gaara of the Desert.
 His mission experience,eight C-ranks. B-ranks…
 Wow, one B-rank as a Genin, eh…
 He's a Shinobi from a different landand is a rookie,
 so there is no furtherdetailed information.
 But…
 It seems he has returned fromall of his missions uninjured.
 B-rank as a Genin…But uninjured…?!
 What is this guy?
 Leaf, Sand, Rain, Grass,Waterfall, Sound…
 There are lots of exceptional Geninsfrom those villages
 who have come to takethe Exam this year as well.
 As far as the Village Hiddenin Sound goes,
 it's a village of a small nation thatjust sprang up in recent years,
 so there isn't much information…
 At any rate,
 they're all Hidden Villageswith nothing but crackerjacks.
 That kind of makes you loseyour confidence.
 Why are you saying that now?
 In other words…
 all of the applicants whohave gathered here…
 That's right!
 Not just Lee and Gaara,
 but they're all choice top eliteGenin from each nation.
 Hmm.
 This isn't going to be easy.
 I can't go along with this!
 They may be your subordinates now,
 but they are childrenwho were my students.
 If it's about them I know…
 It's as you say, Iruka.
 It's not going to be that easy.
 You're too eager.
 I postponed my team's test-takingfor one year
 and took care to build uptheir skills.
 Have them take the Exam afterthey've enjoyed their life a little bit more.
 Hmph…
 They might be too easygoing.
 But they will surpassyour guys in no time.
 That's enough.
 That's as far asthe rookie matter goes.
 Now then, next…
 I'll take recommendations for Geninother than rookies.
 Well! Don't pour cold water on this…
 I said that, nevertheless…
 I wonder if even the fearless onesare frightened just this time around.
 Stubborn as he is,
 he's still consumed by this atmosphereand number of people.
 He's tense.
 It can't be helped.
 Even though everyone is a Genin,we're the newest most inexperienced rookies.
 I'm very, very uneasy.
 But…
 It's kind of tough looking atNaruto who's not himself.
 Maybe I'll cheer him up a bit.
 Say…Naruto! Don't be so scared.
 Huh?
 My name's Naruto Uzumaki!
 I won't lose to any of you!Got it?!
 Say! What's with him?!
 That idiot would neverget depressed! Absurd!
 It won't do any good toprovoke everyone!
 Don't tell me!
 If I don't tell it to you,who do I tell it to?!
 What did you say?!
 Oh, I feel better.
 Hmph…
 Isn't that the guy from before…?
 The dog's bark isbigger than its bite.
 Is he an idiot…?
 He's mighty high-spirited.
 He's hot-headed, eh.
 Lee, maybe you didnot bully him enough.
 Did you hear?
 Sound Village is a minorHidden Village of a small nation.
 That's offensive.
 Maybe I'll…play with them a bit.
 Yes, being referred to as somethinglike leftover Shinobis and all.
 We'll add this to his data.
 Those Sound Shinobisare brutal in their own way.
 I won't lose to any of you,you say?
 You said it…!
 That idiot…
 In no time at all, he's made enemiesof his surroundings.
 What're you talking big for?! You!
 But, I just said what was true, I say!
 E-Everyone, that was a joke.
 This guy's quite an idiot, you see…
 After all, he says idiotic, spazzy,scatterbrained things
 and gets carried away,
 so please don't concern yourself with him.
 Jeez, thanks to you, I got glared at!
 I'm going to kick your butt!
 Shall we do it?
 Let's do it.
 Learn how to read atmospherealready, you!
 Fine!
 These guys…are the Sound Village…
 He dodged it!
 I can see through that speed.
 I see… It's that kind of attack, eh?
 What's going on?
 He was supposed to have evaded it.
 Why'd that happen to his glasses?
 Probably grazed the tip of his nose.
 He's trying to act strong, so. That punk.
 Huh?!
 Oh! He puked?!
 K-Kabuto?
 Huh?!
 Hah!
 Hey, Kabuto!
 Are you okay?!
 Yeah…I'm okay.
 Really?
 Oh, so he's not so special.
 Even though he's a veteran who'sbeen taking the exams for four whole years.
 Write this on your card.
 The three from Sound village…Doubtless Chunin.
 Kabuto should've totally read the attack…
 But why did he vomit?
 Lee. How about that technique just now?
 I had no problem reading the speed.
 There's some kind of trick...
 Silence! Degenerates!
 Sorry to keep you waiting…I
 I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for thefirst test of the Chunin Exam.
 It feels like the chance to show offthe fruits of our training has finally come.
 Well, no matter what kindof test it is,
 it's gonna be a snap!
 I'm picturing Sasuke and thembowing to me and saying,
 ""Naruto, we're really no match for you.""
 Huh? Is this for real?!

 Assassin of the Moonlit Night
 T-This guy…
 Sasuke!
 So we were too late…
 Those guys…
 Sa…Sakura…?
 You guys…
 T-This…
 He probably fought recklessly…
 like that time!
 Sasuke!
 Kakashi Sensei said there was nothingto worry about with the bruise!
 So tell me…Sakura…
 Sakura!
 What do you want?!
 This guy… Who is he?!
 His outward appearanceis different, but…
 he’s that guy called Gaara.
 When I came into this world, I took the lifeof the woman some might call my mother.
 So that I could becomethe strongest Shinobi…
 my father brought his Ninjutsu upon me,
 and so I became possessedby a Sand Spirit.
 I was born a monster.
 So that's what he was saying…
 He’s the one who hurt Sasuke…
 Hey young girl!
 I want you to know thatI’m not the fighting type!
 I can see that by looking at you!
 In any case,I need to get away from here
 and somehow take Sasuke towhere Kakashi Sensei is!
 You…
 Sasuke…!
 Well! Your limit is two shots…
 That’s about it…
 The third shot won’t be activated…Remember this well.
 If you try to force a Jutsu to activate…
 not only will the Jutsunot properly activate,
 but your Chakra will deplete to zero…
 and in the worst case, you’ll die!
 Even if you were to survive,absolutely nothing good will come of it.
 Especially in your case…
 Is it the Curse Mark…?
 If you let your hatred take over you,
 and rely on the powerof the Curse Mark…
 your development will stop there.
 If that happens, you won’tbe able to beat Itachi.
 In any case,I need to get control over this.
 Sasuke!
 I see you’re…
 the one I failed to kill that time.
 I live fighting for only myselfand loving myself…
 And as long as there are others to kill…
 I will never disappear.
 L-Let’s run! Everyone!
 Die! Sasuke Uchiha!
 Sakura!
 Out of the way!
 Sakura!
 How could she standin the way of that Gaara…?
 Darn! Darn!What the heck should we do?!
 Just with him, I don’t want to…
 Now, let me feel it!
 Why…?
 Gaara, Please calm down.
 It’s no use after all…
 The sand gets in the way.
 Gaara…
 Yashamaru!
 I may not look it,
 but Lord Kazekage charged meto look after your physical condition
 as a member of medical corpsand to be with you.
 Please do not do such thingsin front of me.
 Although the sand will protect you…
 Yashamaru… I’m sorry…
 Oh, this..? It’s just a scrape.
 A scrape…
 Is it painful?
 A little bit… But it’ll heal in no time.
 Hey Yashamaru…
 What is it?
 What is pain?
 I’ve…never once had a wound so…
 I wondered what it’s like…
 Well…
 How can I explain it?
 It’s like it’s distressing, or difficult…
 In other words, to be hit or cut…
 Maybe I should say it’s a feelingof not being able to bear it,
 of not being able to stay normal…
 I can’t say it well,
 but I suppose it means a situationthat’s not very good.
 Yashamaru…
 Yes?
 So, do you dislike me…Yashamaru?
 People live their lives whilehurting others and while being hurt.
 But it’s not so easy forpeople to dislike others.
 Thank you, Yashamaru.
 I think I sort of understandwhat pain is now.
 I see…
 So…maybe I’m injured too?The same as everyone?
 I'm always…in pain.
 I’m not bleeding, but…
 I’ve been having a lot ofpain around…here.
 Blood does flow from a woundon the body
 and the wound may appear painful.
 But as time passes, the painnaturally disappears.
 By using medicine,the healing is even faster.
 But what’s dangerous isa wound of the heart.
 Nothing has more trouble healing.
 A wound of the heart?
 A wound on the body anda wound of the heart are slightly different.
 Unlike a wound on the body,there is no ointment and sometimes,
 it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life.
 But there is one thing thatcan cure a wound of the heart.
 However, this is a complicated medicine.
 It can only be given to youby another person.
 What? What must I do to…?
 The thing that can curea wound of the heart.
 That is…
 love.
 Love?
 Yes.
 H-How can I get it?What do I need to do for this pain to be…?
 It has already been given to you, Gaara.
 Huh?
 Love is…a heart that desires to servea precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person,just like my older sister did.
 I believe that my older sisterloved you, Gaara.
 Sand Spirit Shukaku is a spirit of a living person used for the purpose of attacks.
 The sand which automatically tries toprotect you is like the love of a mother.
 I believe that sand is filledwith your mother’s will.
 My sister…probably wanted toprotect you even more after dying…
 Yashamaru…
 What is it?
 Thanks for what you did earlier…for stopping me.
 You are welcome.
 You are a precious personwho is near me, Gaara!
 Can you understand…my pain?
 It tastes like iron…
 Twenty!
 Twenty-one!
 Leaf…Hurricane!
 How many did you takedown Kakashi?
 Twenty-two.
 Huh, it seems I win again!
 That was my twenty-third.
 Yeah, yeah all right…
 That poser attitude of yoursstill makes you cool!
 That’s the reason you are my rival!
 – Let’s go! 					– All right!
 Hey, Yashamaru…I have a favor to ask!
 What is it?
 I want some ointment.
 Sorry about earlier…lt must’ve hurt.
 This is medicine.
 If you want it--
 Go home…freak!
 Oh, what the--?!
 Hey, be careful, you brat--
 Y-You are…
 – Again… 					– Go home, freak!
 These eyes…
 Y-You are…
 Why…? Why?!
 H-Hey!
 What the--? What’s going on?
 It’s…it’s Gaara!
 Hey! This guy's dead.
 Father…
 As I thought… Things don’t go well…
 Why is it…that only I’m such a freak?!
 What…am I?!
 The thing that can curea wound of the heart is love.
 Yashamaru!
 Huh?
 Why? Why me…?
 Why always me?!
 Who…? Why…?
 Well done…Gaara.
 Yashamaru…!
 It’s those eyes…
 What’s the matter?Weren’t you gonna run away?
 Sasuke…
 Naruto…
 What are these two…to you?!
 T-These two are…my friends!
 Try laying so much asanother finger on them!
 I’ll clobber you!
 So…what’s the matter?!Weren’t you gonna clobber me?
 Hurry up and come at me…
 Darn it!
 Everyone makes mistakeslt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
 So many regretsDon’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chestYes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes It’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 I know this guy’s strength.
 I may seem like a senselessweakling to him.
 But…what’s…?What’s this feeling welling up inside me?
 I don’t know…
 I don’t know,but I just don’t want to lose to this guy!

 Please don’t die…I’ll get you out now.
 Hey!
 What are you doing there?
 Curry of Life Shop
 One, two… 					One, two…
 Hope they’re all right.
 I’m sure they’ll be ableto bring Karashi back.
 Definitely, Definitely.
 One, two…
 That’s the Katabami Gold Mine…
 Instead of just gettingRokusuke and Karashi back,
 let’s finish the Kurosuki Familyonce and for all!
 Don’t get carried away, Naruto.
 So, what are we gonna do then?
 I’m kind of worried aboutwhat Guy Sensei told us.
 The boss of the Kurosuki Familymay be
 one of the Seven Ninja SwordsMen of the Mist.
 Who knows whatthey’ll do to Rokusuke?
 Yeah, but how seriouslycan we take Guy Sensei’s info?
 What are you talking about?!Guy Sensei is always right!
 Calm down, Lee.We should investigate first.
 Yeah!
 Sir Raiga, we were ableto capture Rokusuke,
 one of the three thatslipped out of the village.
 Well done.
 It seems that they went to askfor some help from a Ninja village.
 Where did you go?!
 I’m sorry.
 Don’t bother, rookie.
 Yes sir!
 Rokusuke, I thought we hada good relationship
 with everybody in the Gold Mine.
 Well, that’s…
 Why is it? I’m so deeply sorryto hear that you left the village.
 I can’t remember how thingswere in the past,
 when everything was going well.
 I’m sorry, I’m sorry.I won’t do it again!
 Yeah, I have a good idea.
 I’m going to arrangefor your funeral.
 Please don’t! Please let me go!
 I won’t do it again,so please forgive me!
 Why? Don’t you like funerals?
 No, I don’t wanna die yet!
 You know, I really like funerals…
 Think about it.
 When they are alive, humans speak illof each other,
 they betray each other,and they hate each other.
 But at a funeral,
 they forget all the hatredthey had for the other.
 They even rememberthe good times they had together.
 Right?
 You have to be kidding me!No! Please don’t do it.
 Hey!
 Let me go!
 It’s a done deal then.Let’s have a big funeral for Rokusuke.
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 Come on!
 Hurry up!
 Is that gold?There’s nothing shiny about it.
 They have to meltthat ore into mercury.
 After that they evaporate itand only then does it turn into pure gold.
 I don’t get it.
 Well, there is no needfor you to understand it.
 Oh!
 Huh? What are you doing?!Hurry up!
 If you don’t hurry up,
 I’m gonna ask the bossto let me hold your funeral!
 Please forgive me!
 I’m getting really mad now.I won't forgive them!
 Calm down, Naruto…
 We don’t know anythingabout them yet.
 That’s right. We should dowhat Neji is telling us.
 Yeah but…
 if we don’t do something,that poor old guy is going to die!
 Naruto, leave things to me here.
 Wait, Lee!
 Hey, hey.Hurry up and pick them up!
 Yeah! Way to go, Lee!
 Are you okay, old man?
 Oh my gosh!What have you done?!
 Here. Drink some water.
 What are you doing?!
 I beg you.Please punch me, kick me.
 Please knock me around
 like the way you just didwith those guys.
 What are you saying?
 If you won’t do it,I’ll do it myself!
 What are you doing?!
 Stop!
 I’m scared.
 Just think what they’ll do
 if they knew I wasthe only one that was safe.
 What was that sound?
 Did they find us?
 Oh my, that’s the soundof the funeral bell.
 Funeral?
 Yeah.
 Raiga, the boss of the Kurosuki familywhich rules this town,
 arranges a funeral forthose who betray him.
 He buries them alive.
 What? They bury them alive?That’s so cruel!
 Yeah but…
 Raiga always cries sadlyduring the funeral.
 That’s one weird guy.
 But…
 That doesn’t seem to bethe sound of the bell for you.
 Yeah, I heard that Rokusukewas caught this morning, so…
 What?!
 I’m so happy, I rememberthe first day I met that guy.
 Yeah? That’s nice.
 Yeah… When I told him we were takingover the mountain from the magistrate,
 he was so relieved to be freed fromthe high taxes that he was paying.
 He was laughing out of pure joy…He was a really nice guy.
 I like funerals.Makes me feel nostalgic.
 Would you put ona big funeral for me too?
 Fool! I’m not putting ona funeral for you.
 You are not goingto die before me.
 I don’t have to have a funeral for youto think of the good times
 because you are always a good boy.
 Raiga.
 What is it?
 They're coming.They’ll show up anytime now.
 Yeah… I’m excited to seewhat kind of help he sought.
 Okay! Let’s save the guy.
 Let’s do it, Neji.
 Okay.
 Byakugan!
 It’s all right. He’s still alive.
 If we can get rid ofthe guys around him,
 we can save him.
 Okay! Let’s get ridof them quickly!
 Yeah!
 Okay, let’s go!
 No…! Let me out!
 An enemy attack!
 You…!
 Tenten, you take the right!
 Okay!
 Gentle Fist!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Na-ru-to…
 Uzumaki Barrage!
 That’s the way!
 – Watch out! 					– Huh?
 There are three more!
 Here comes the Leaf Village'sHandsome Devil, Rock Lee!
 I found the last one!
 You are…
 Who is this guy?
 Well…
 This is Karashi.
 The one Grandma Sanshowas talking about…
 This is Karashi?
 Karashi, was it your own decisionto join the Kurosuki Family…
 just like Grandma Sansho said it was?
 So what if it was?
 What?!
 Sir Raiga is great!
 He dethroned the old evil governmentof the Katabami Gold Mine,
 and he liberated everybodyfrom the village!
 One, two, one two…
 One, two, one two…
 Umm, Grandma…
 Oh my… 					You are so greedy!
 They are fighting their livesout there by going into the gold mine…
 Can’t you just wait at leastwhile I’m cooking the curry?
 I don’t mind waiting but…I think something is burning.
 What?
 Oh my, oh my…
 Oops…
 Yeah, it burned…
 Karashi, did you know that
 Grandma Sansho worries about youeveryday while cooking curry?
 Naruto, leave things to me here.
 Karashi, you saved my lifewith your curry of life.
 If you can make sucha wonderful curry,
 how can you stay with the family ofa man with no respect for life?!
 Why?
 Nobody cares to compliment meeven if I can make that curry.
 As a man born in this world,
 I should gain more power andtry to take over the world!
 Instead of sitting around in that storethat no one patronizes anymore.
 What? I can’t take this anymore!
 Lee!
 Karashi, not only did you andGrandma Sansho’s curry save my life…
 But you also taught me thatif you make it from the heart,
 just one serving of currycould save lives,
 and that even somebody like mecould do anything just by trying hard.
 You looked much strongerand dignified then than you do now.
 Karashi!
 I’ve never seen anybodywho tries this hard.
 I see. You want to savethis boy too, huh…
 Please promise me…Please get out of the Kurosuki Family!
 You're right…
 I’m sorry… I’m so sorry!
 Oh, I’m so relieved.
 Hey! Please get me out of here.
 It’s dark and I can’t breathe.
 Oh yeah!
 We almost forgotabout Rokusuke.
 Mmm? You guys…
 Sorry to keep you waiting.lt’s all right now.
 I’m sorry. Thinking that maybe
 I could still save my friendwho got buried alive…
 I just couldn’t stay still.
 Yeah, I understand.
 Neji, what is it?
 What is this?
 This feeling of danger…
 Hey Neji, what is it?
 We are being watched.lt’s probably Raiga.
 What?
 From the top of that cliff…
 Okay. Let’s go!
 Karashi, please take care of Rokusuke.
 All right.
 No one’s here.
 Where did he go?
 Mmm? What is that?
 This mist…
 Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu!
 Hidden Mist Jutsu…A specialty of Mist Village Ninja.
 So, what Guy Sensei said was true?
 Damn, I can’t see anything!
 Neji, try to find the enemywith your Byakugan.
 I’ve been trying…!
 Uh…Can’t see a thing!
 That’s impossible.Even Neji’s Byakugan
 that’s supposed to let himsee 360 degrees won’t work!
 What’s going on?
 There isn’t supposed to bea Jutsu that can break Byakugan!
 What do you think, Ranmaru?
 It’s amazing…
 One of them can see throughthe Chakra Network.
 He probably has some sortof Kekkei Genkai power.
 He can see us?
 It’s all right,my power is superior to his…
 So, what are you going to do?
 Everybody in the KatabamiGold Mine is depending on me.
 I’m the one who has tokeep the peace of this village.
 Are you going to hold a funeral?
 No, even if I hold a funeral,I have no memories of them.
 I’ll just get rid of them!
 Look,Ninja Art: Lightning Fang!
 Wh-What is it?!
 Lighting! Drop!
 What do you think, Ranmaru?
 It’s great, Raiga!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 Naruto Barrage! What?
 Leaf Hurricane! Mm?
 Here I come! Huh?
 Impossible!
 Hey! The enemy disappeared!
 I have nobody either!
 What? There is no enemy!
 Neji! Are you usingyour Byakugan correctly?!
 I am doing it right!
 It’s impossible, but my Byakuganis picking up Chakra!

 He became adept at usingSharingan at the age of eight.

 Stop it! Elder Brother!
 Don’t kill Father and Mother!
 W-Why…
 Why did you…? Elder Brother…?
 To measure my abilities…
 Measure your abilities…?Just for that?
 Are you saying that…
 Just for that…you killed them all?
 That is of great importance.
 What do you mean…?
 Don’t talk rubbish!
 I’m scared…
 I’m scared!
 Don’t kill me…!
 D-Don’t kill me!
 You are not even worth killing…
 Foolish little brother…
 If you want to kill me, begrudge me!Hate me!
 And keep on surviving inthat unsightly manner…
 Just continue fleeing and fleeingand hang onto your life!
 Shall we go outside…?
 These guys aren’t just anybody…
 Itachi, it’ll be a pain in the neckif this kid moves around and…
 Maybe I better chop offa leg just in case…
 W-What did he say?!
 Now then…
 Long time no see…
 Sasuke.
 Itachi Uchiha!
 Itachi…Uchiha?
 The same as Sasuke…An Uchiha…
 Huh…Sharingan…
 And moreover,he resembles you a lot…
 Who the heck is he?
 He’s my younger brother.
 But I heard that the entire Uchiha clanhad been murdered.
 By you.
 Itachi Uchiha…I will kill you!
 I must kill one certain manwithout fail!
 That man…
 My elder brother…
 I thought I couldn’t die…without killing him, but…
 That’s the guy that Sasukewas saying …
 The man he wanted to kill…
 It’s just as you said…
 I held a grudge against youand hated you.
 For the singular purpose ofkilling you, I…
 I…
 have lived my life!
 Sasuke…!
 Chidori…?
 I will kill you!
 Die!
 W-What’s going on?!
 I can’t believe that Sasuke’s Jutsuwas so easily thwarted…
 This doesn’t look good!
 I’ve got to do something!
 Chakra permeates the air…
 I see…
 So this is the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra!
 You jerk!
 You’re in the way!
 Sasuke!
 Darn it!
 Ninja Art: Summo…
 You’re too slow!
 Huh…? I can’t feel the Chakra…
 Darn! Darn! Why is it?!
 My sword Shark Skinhas the ability to…
 cut through and eat Chakra!
 It’s a pain in the butt
 if the kid moves aroundand uses Jutsu like that…
 Before these legs…
 Should I chop off these arms?
 Why doesn’t it emerge?!
 It’s pointless…
 What?
 You guys just don’t know me much,do you?
 This man Jiraiya does not fall victimto any woman’s allurement,
 but rather his forte iswinning women’s affection!
 I’m not made to blindly follow aftera woman’s feminine charm!
 When you get to my level,
 women yelp with delightat my sex appeal!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools\
 Watch out, Sasuke!
 Naruto, don’t help him.
 But…Sasuke is!
 It is your duty to watchthrough this battle, Naruto.
 What?!
 This is his fight…
 This represents everything thathe has been carrying up to now.

 because we were always together

 Kiba!
 Naruto!
 You okay, Kiba?
 Yeah…
 Is this also Genjutsu…?!
 No one, including Akamaru,can escape from Yakumo’s Genjutsu.
 It’s because…
 we have an enlarged neural tube…the cerebrum…
 Guys, move away from the door!
 Parasitic Insects.
 Please, Sensei…Tell me the truth.
 If you don’t…I’ll rub you out…
 I reached the decisionto seal your Genjutsu power
 at my own discretion.
 It has nothing to do withthe Third Hokage…
 Vent your resentment…
 The only one you should hate is me…
 I heard…!
 I heard you andthe Third Hokage talking
 about trying to destroythe Kurama Clan!
 Yakumo, you’ve got the wrong idea.
 You lie!
 No way could my motherand father die in just a fire!
 My parents were killed…!
 What?!
 Shino…
 What’s this?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 All right!
 I’m counting on you guys!
 –Right! 					–Right!
 Now, I’m ready when you are…
 One, two…
 Charge!
 Go!
 N-Naruto…
 Naruto?!
 Kurenai Sensei!What happened to your…?
 Yakumo, did you do this…?
 That person tried to eliminate me…
 So she’s just facing the consequences.
 You’re wrong!
 Yakumo, you’vemisunderstood something.
 I heard everything about you andKurenai Sensei from Old Man Unkai.
 Stop, Naruto!
 Listen up.Kurenai Sensei sealed your powers
 because she cares about you!
 What’re you talking about?!
 You’re not the only one who’s suffering!
 Kurenai Sensei hid the truth allthis time and has suffered alone!
 Stop!
 The…truth…?
 The Supposed Sealed Ability
 Guy Sensei!
 Hey, where is everyone?!
 Shino and Hinata are standingwatch in the hallway,
 but Kurenai Sensei and Naruto
 are now inside the worldcreated by Yakumo’s Genjutsu!
 Huh? What do you mean?!
 I’ll explain…
 Mr. Unkai, you should take it easy.
 No… I must nowexplain the truth…
 Nobody has taken such affectionate careof Yakumo as Kurenai.
 Kurenai’s resolve was to get Yakumoto give up on being a Shinobi…
 Yakumo was completely in low spirits.
 Lord Murakumo was also concerned…
 Then one day, that incident occurred…
 The residence of the head familyburned to the ground
 and Yakumo stood motionlessin front of it…
 I saw it at that time…
 The form of a monster witha face like a female demon
 hovering in the flames…!
 After learning of its identity…I became frozen with terror.
 What is…the truth?!
 Sensei… What the heck is happeningto Yakumo…?
 This is bad…!
 Yakumo! You don’t know…
 You don’t know anything!
 Something’s… Yes…
 There is something…in the recesses of my mind…
 But… What is it…?I can’t remember…
 Oh no…!
 Naruto, stop that!
 Huh?!
 Naruto!
 What is this thing?!Damn it. Let me go!
 All I want to do is live up toeveryone’s expectations, and yours.
 And yet…Why does everyone get in my way?
 I just want to become a Genjutsu user…
 People have their respectiveappropriate paths.
 You probably have your own path.
 That’s right…
 There’s no need to force yourselfto become a Shinobi…
 No… I don’t want that!
 Everyone may comfort me with words…
 But I know.I know they’re disappointed in me.
 I can’t stand having to livemy whole life feeling that burden.
 Yakumo, what’s that…?
 R-Run, Uroko!
 Yakumo!
 I remember…
 Yakumo…?!
 Yes…me…
 The person inside me killedmy mother and father…!
 I killed them with Genjutsu!
 No, Yakumo!That wasn’t you…
 You and that monster are different!
 No, we’re not different…
 You see, that thing…was living inside my heart.
 Thanks… Kurenai Sensei…
 Goodbye…
 Stop!
 Yakumo!
 Wh-What’s…that…?!
 In order for us to geta clear picture of the incident,
 we first requesteda complete examination of Yakumo…
 As a result, we learned the monsterthat appeared at the time of the fire
 was an Id Monster so to speak,created by Yakumo’s sub-consciousness.
 An Id…Monster…
 Then I made a direct appealto the Third Hokage…
 Ultimately, Yakumo couldnot endure the weight
 of living up to our expectationsfrom the time she was little
 and that triggered her sub-consciousnessto attempt to expunge everything.
 Yakumo’s sub-consciousnesswill probably attempt to
 expunge the Kurama Clanand eventually the entire Leaf Village.
 I cannot consent to that…
 Despite such a risk,
 taking the life of Yakumo who hasno awareness of evil cannot be allowed!
 It’ll be too late
 once her sub-consciousnesscompletely awakens!
 Then we just have to get herto learn how to control it herself…
 or seal her powers if that’s not possible.
 But…
 Although slightly differentfrom Yakumo’s case…
 There’s a precedent of a baby being usedto seal the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit.
 That’s absurd…!
 There isn’t a Jutsu practitioner
 who can seal the strong powersYakumo possesses…
 There might be just one personwho can accomplish that…
 However, it will becomea painful mission.
 Hopefully, this person can teach herhow to control her powers…
 But if it comes to sealing her powers,
 the Jutsu practitioner will end uperasing all the potential in the child…
 The Jutsu practitioner willhave to live with the burden
 of Yakumo’s resentmentin place of the Kurama Clan…
 The Third Hokage said thatand then cried.
 The one who accepted thatpainful mission was…
 Yuhi Kurenai.
 I see…
 So that’s what Kurenai Senseiwas talking about.
 I…didn’t know anything about Sensei…
 I knew that Kurenai had sealedYakumo’s powers…
 But it’s the first time I’ve heard
 about the incidenther sub-consciousness caused.
 Yes… The Third Hokage passed away
 and at this point, it’s a secret known onlyto the Kurama Clan and Yuhi Kurenai.
 She made herself into the bad guyand kept the secret, huh…?
 Kurenai Sensei…!
 You go, too!
 –But… 					–Sakura…
 I’ll take over things here…!
 Guy Sensei…
 You’re concerned about Narutoand the others, right?
 Go to them…!
 Right!
 I leave Yakumo…to you…
 What is it…?
 I don’t know… But…
 This feeling…
 It’s somehowentirely different from before…
 My insects are acting strange.
 What’s going on inside?!ls Kurenai Sensei okay?
 It’s powerful…
 A massive Chakra beyond compareis being produced…!
 Naruto…
 Why…? Why do you haveto take your own life…?
 What…?!
 What must be destroyed are the ones
 who forced you to shouldera heavy burden
 and on top of that,tried to eliminate me…!
 Who’re you…?
 I crept into an opening in the depthsof your mind and was nurtured.
 My name is Id…!
 She’s finally awoken…
 Kurenai Sensei,what is that thing?
 It happened soon after I was madeYakumo’s personal instructor.
 It was when I had doubts aboutthe high level of Yakumo’s Genjutsu
 and looked into her deep psyche.
 I discovered that thing!
 I could only stand motionlessin front of that terrible figure.
 It wasn’t Yakumo whomthe Third Hokage said to eliminate…
 It was her Id monster…
 So that’s what it was…?
 This ominous ghastliness…is more powerful than before.
 But I must stop it from gettinginto the real world,
 even if we have to kill each other…!
 Kill each other?! 					I see…
 She was that determined…
 So that’s why she quit Squad Eight.
 I’ll take your feelings into this bodyand settle the score…
 You jerk!
 You’re in the way. Move it!
 Naruto!
 I don’t knowwhat the heck you are…
 But Kiba, Shino, Hinata,they’re all waiting for Sensei’s return!
 Naruto…!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 My Jutsu won’t activate in this world…!
 You are a thorn in my side…I’ll erase you first.
 Look out!
 Yakumo, you’re the only onewho can defeat it now!
 What…?
 Listen, Yakumo… All people havea fanged beast in their minds…
 It always lives in the depths ofa person’s mind
 and will suddenly appear.
 The power of the beast thatappears is enormous and
 regardless of one’s own will,it can inadvertently hurt those around it.
 But…if that monster can be tamed
 and then controlledwith one’s own power…
 It becomes a magnificent power
 and acts to makeyour dreams come true.
 Now, fight!
 Abate by your own handthe monster you created!
 B-But…
 Yakumo, only you can do this!
 Die, boy…
 Darkness in my mind, abate!
 Die!
 Why…? 					I…served…you well…
 Kurenai Sensei,you’re back to normal!
 Kurenai…Sensei…
 You did well, Yakumo…You defeated your own darkness.
 Sensei…
 You did it, Yakumo…
 Yakumo…
 She knew exactly who wasreally trying to save her…
 –Kurenai Sensei! 					–Sensei…
 It’s okay now!
 Kurenai Sensei…
 You’ll go back to beingeveryone’s teacher, right?
 That’s right…
 My final mission fromthe Third Hokage is over…
 –Sensei! 					–Sensei!
 That’s great that things couldget back to normal…
 Sakura…!
 Naruto…?
 I will too.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 This isn’t funny!
 Why do we have to get all worn outfor someone like him?
 Exactly! We were told to protectthe Beauty of Nature,
 but he keeps getting in our way.ls this some kind of joke?
 Plus, he uses people as scapegoatsand shields.
 He thinks it’s only natural forShinobi to die in missions.
 I can’t take this anymore!
 Me neither.lf it comes to this, then I’m…
 – …gonna use Rasengan!– …gonna use Gatsuuga!
 – And beat up this client up so bad!– And beat up this client up so bad!

 Your strong will is going to remainas Residual Aura inside me.
 It’s not like you’ll lose everything.

 become unable to reanimatefor several years.
 However there’s a next time…
 I-Indeed. My body no longer has valueas a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.
 It will now be difficult for mewho has lost everything…
 to find my own calling.
 I’ve finally understood that.
 Even if it’s not me…
 I’ll bring in the new “vessel,”even if it costs me my life.

 Get going already.
 Wh-Why are you…?
 I’m sorry, Naruto.lt’s my miscalculation.
 Kimimaro.
 You were taking too long, Tayuya.
 And what happened tothe other three?
 Being none other than thoseof the former “Sound Ninja Five.”
 Why are you…?
 Your body… Your body’s no longer…
 I’m not moving with the flesh anymore.lt’s mental power.
 Man, you cheater of death…
 I understand a little now,that feeling…
 of being information that has escapedfrom the prison of the flesh.
 The feeling of experiencinga taste of Lord Orochimaru’s dream.
 Orochimaru…!
 This vessel…is an important vesselfor the dream…
 The flesh that Lord Orochimarutruly desires.
 But you guys were a bit too late.
 Some dangerous guyhas appeared again.
 That air about him isnothing ordinary.
 Anyway, we needto sort out the situation.
 If we were to carelesslyplunge in…
 You jerk.What’re you babbling nonsense?
 Naruto!
 Give back Sasuke!
 Hey, wait!
 Tayuya.
 The reason why I won’t kill you now
 is because you have a missionyou have to complete.
 And my mission is to deliverthat to Lord Orochimaru.
 Isn’t it too late now?
 Humph. I told you.
 That’s the body that Lord Orochimarutruly desires.
 The next vessel, huh?
 That’s right…
 And this is the only thing thatI can do at present.
 I leave those two piecesof garbage to you.
 Sasuke…
 That punk!
 Calm down, Naruto.
 How can I calm down?
 At this rate,Sasuke will get far away again.
 Naruto’s right.
 This is a mission to bring Sasuke backto the Leaf Village.
 We must choose what would bethe most rational means
 to execute the mission.
 Damned punks.
 I’ll finish this in a flash.
 Naruto, listen up.
 Please move according to the planthat I’m going to tell you.
 He’s a classic close-rangecombat-type fool
 with Shadow Clone Jutsuas his only saving grace.
 And he’s a middle-rangecombat type
 who binds his enemies witha Jutsu using shadows…
 and a sharp squad leader, huh?
 Got it?
 Yeah.
 Come on already, you punks.
 It’s two versus one.We’ve got the upper hand.
 It’s an opponent we can beatif we team up.
 Let’s go, Naruto.
 All right.
 With garbage like you jerks,
 it doesn’t matter how manyof you are there.
 Don’t underestimate our teamwork.
 Let’s go!
 Bring it.
 Now... Naruto.
 I’ll blow you away.
 Gotcha. The strategy is a success.
 Farewell.
 Blast.
 You tricked me.
 Teamwork, my foot. You little punks…
 Blast.
 You wouldn’t fall for the same trickover and over, huh..?
 Small fry… You’ve got nerve.
 Well, I guess I’ll settle for justhaving been able to let him get away.
 Remember this.
 It’s not just Jutsu that are weapons.
 I’m counting on you, Shikamaru.
 Hang in there, Sasuke.
 But that kid,
 how wonderful it is thathe can move with that body, eh?
 Kabuto, I don’t know what kindof order you gave him,
 but it’s a bit harsh.
 Not at all.lt wasn’t an order.
 I don’t like to force things.
 He acted on his own.
 For you whom he reveres.
 Kabuto…You’ve really gota hateful personality, don’t you?
 Lord Orochimaru.
 To you,Kimimaro was a perfect existence…
 His thoughts were steeped in darknessin the same way as yours.
 And he sanctified you.
 And he fanatically admiredand revered you.
 Moreover, he was of the Shinobi clanwith the strongest and perfect bodies
 being the legitimate bloodlineof their Kekkai Genkai…
 until a short time ago.
 Yes…
 When I think about having lost him,I still get a chill down my spine.
 I think about it even now…
 The man I truly wished for…The body I wanted the most…Kimimaro.
 And if only he hadn’t been strickenwith disease,
 the assassination of the Hokagewould’ve gone smoother.
 Seal!
 My arms….
 Now…you can no longer useeither of your arms…
 And since you can't use your arms,
 you can't weave Sign…
 You no longer possess Ninjutsu!
 Your ambition of crushingthe Hidden Leaf…dies right here!
 Orochimaru, you fool…
 It's unfortunate that we can't leavetogether but, my disciple…
 Let's meet in the other worldone day…
 Sasuke…Sasuke’s not here yet?
 We wouldn’t have needed to gothrough such an experience.
 In the world, very often things don’t goas we want them to.
 It’s only a matter of time,Lord Orochimaru.
 When Tayuya…comes back,I’ll kill her.
 Hold it.
 Hey…!
 Now then, how shall I defeat you?
 You…
 Those eyes…
 It seems he possessesa peculiar Chakra.
 What does Orochimaru want to do…?Why’s he after Sasuke?
 Lord Orochimaru has alreadyobtained Immortality Jutsu…
 A long time is necessary to get every Jutsuand obtain everything in the world.
 What does that have to dowith Sasuke?!
 “Immortal” doesn’t mean thatthe flesh is being maintained as is…
 Before his body decays,
 a strong and new flesh will be madeinto a vessel for his soul.
 That’s…
 Are you saying that’s Sasuke?!
 Yes… That’s right.
 I won’t let such a thing happen!
 Idiot… What will come of sendingone shrimp punk in pursuit?
 And looking at thingsin terms of time,
 up until now you probably sacrificedone member each time
 in order for the groupto move forward.
 Is that guy called Sasukethat important?
 How many of your men do you intendto sacrifice for the sake of just one person?
 You incompetent punk.
 Heh… Indeed…
 For me, this is my first missionas a platoon leader.
 It’s very disquieting havingcomrades gradually whittled down,
 and I didn’t know if my own judgmentswere correct or not.
 As a squad leader withthe lives of the party in my hands…
 respecting the lives inthe four-member party,
 rather than the life of one persontaken by the enemy…
 and deciding to abort a missionthat’s too dangerous, would be by the book.
 Then, why didn’t you do that?
 The world doesn’t goby the book very often…
 Since not one person in my squadwould do something like
 abandon a captured comrade and give upfighting for the sake of their own safety.
 Me included.
 Being the cloud-loving loafer myself,
 I am not cut out to be a squad leaderwho gives orders to comrades.
 The only thing I can do for them...is to have faith in them.
 Listen. I’m not thinking anythinglike they were sacrifices.
 I’m not thinking anythinglike they’ve died.
 Don’t mock my comrades.
 I got you.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 This doesn’t…look so good.
 I’ll play a melody of death for you.
 Don’t you mock us,you damned punk.
 I won’t let you take Sasuke,no matter what.
 Interesting.
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 Damn it! What'll I do?!
 He's trouble enough yet,
 but his Chakra has increasedseveral ten-fold!
 It's no good. I can't use it here yet.
 But if I stay like this, we'll…
 I get it, Akamaru.
 It's like you said.
 I have no choice but to use it!

 We’re almost atthe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Is everybody here?
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Big Brother Omasa,we’re missing one!
 What? Who is it?!
 It’s Idate! Morino Idate!
 Darn, he's such a hopeless kid!
 What should we do?Shall we wait?
 We have no choice…
 What the--?!
 Who is it?!
 You people are from the Wasabi Familyof the Land of Tea, correct?
 Who are you!
 You should know your place.
 Hooligans like you peopleare no match for a Shinobi!
 Please don’t worry.I won’t take your lives.
 If you’ve learned from this,
 you should give up the raceat Todoroki Great Shrine.
 Blast it!
 I have to at least deliver this letterto the Hidden Leaf Village.
 OK! Mission! Mission!I’m so eager to do it!
 But Kakashi Sensei is not here.
 Is he late as usual?
 No, Kakashi will not be coming.
 It's Old Lady Tsunade!
 Don’t call me an old lady!
 Excuse me… Lady Hokage…
 What do you mean byKakashi Sensei will not be coming?
 As you three already know,
 most of the Jonin including Kakashiare on different missions.
 This time, the three of you will haveto execute the mission by yourselves.
 This is a B-rank mission,escorting an important figure!
 Escorting an important figure…
 Of course,depending on the situation,
 the mission has the possibilityof becoming an A-rank.
 And, who are we protecting?
 Don’t know…
 What do you mean“don’t know”?!
 In the neighboring nationof the Land of Tea,
 they have a Dedication Ceremonyat the Todoroki Great Shrine
 once every four years.
 We’ve received a requestto escort the runner
 who will be participating inthe race that will be held there.
 But an assailant from the opponent’s side
 attacked the messengersbefore they arrived here.
 Assailant?
 Excuse me, but I still don’tquite understand the mission.
 Well, you should get the detailsdirectly from Boss Jirocho.
 Boss Jirocho?! Oh yeah!The boss from that time!
 That’s it.
 Now that you three understand,depart immediately!
 Get to the Land of Tea by today.Snap to it!
 – Yes! 					– All right.
 Okay!
 Roger that!
 I’m counting on you.
 Mission! Help an Old Friendin the Land of Tea
 Hey Sakura, aren’t you hungry?
 Well, a little bit…
 Then it’s decided!
 And perfect timing!There’s a teahouse right over there!
 Hey, Naruto.
 You’re here…?
 Aoi Rokusho has now arrived.
 I had you go throughall that trouble,
 but Jirocho of the Wasabidoes not know when to give up.
 Is he still trying to take partin the race at Todoroki Great Shrine?
 That’s right.
 And there’s new informationthat they have also hired Shinobi.
 I see…
 Then next time, let’s beat themto a pulp at the race…
 Welcome!
 Ma’am, I’ll have sweet bean soup.
 Then I’ll have dumplings.
 How about you, Sasuke?
 Jelly…
 All right, please wait for a moment.
 Ninja from the Leaf…
 I’m gonna work so hard!
 Naruto, don’t take unnecessary actionby yourself.
 Oh, okay.
 Having sweet bean soupwhen it's so nice outside.
 The Ninja profession sureis carefree!
 What did you say?
 Things must really be peacefulfor the Leaf Village.
 Such a dense-lookingbunch of guys…
 What?!
 Hey! I didn’t know there wassuch a cutie here.
 I take back that previous comment!
 Ah…pardon me.
 I'm Idate Morino.
 What’s your name, young lady?
 Don’t you talk to Sakurain such a familiar tone!
 Sakura… That’s a good name.
 Hey, even a chance meeting is dueto karma from a previous life.
 Why don’t we talk about our future?
 Huh? Talk about…the future?
 I’m talking about you quittingthe Ninja life and becoming my bride…
 Hey you! How dare youhit on her all of a sudden!
 Don’t be silly!
 Just joking.
 But hey, you fool!
 Idate here hates Ninja!
 If you wander aroundthe Land of Tea anymore,
 there’ll be a price to pay!
 That’s amusing! Bring it on!
 Hey, Naruto!
 Ridiculous! We don’t have timeto waste on a hooligan.
 Be quiet, Sasuke!
 I’m not going to forgive a guywho makes fun of Shinobi!
 I’m going to punish this guy…
 Huh?
 He’s gone…
 Impossible!I didn’t even notice…
 Where did that guy run away to?!
 Here, thank you for waiting.
 Dang it!
 Thank you for your patronage.
 What? Two bills?
 This is…?
 Oh, that kid who was here left,saying that you guys would pay.
 That guy!How dare he make fools of us!
 The sound of footsteps is far off…He has considerable speed!
 He made us look like idiots!
 I can’t stay quiet.We have to chase him!
 Missus, thank you very much.I’ll leave the money here.
 Thanks!
 All the customers todayseem to be in such a hurry.
 He has incredible speed.He must have trained very hard.
 Who is he?
 Doesn’t matter, we’re definitelygoing to catch up to him!
 Stupid Ninja!
 There’s no waythey can catch up to me!
 Owww!
 Darn it… Swift Runner Idatemakes a mistake of a lifetime!
 Serves you right!
 You have some nerve,trying to run away from us.
 I’m so sorry!
 Huh?
 I’m sorry…
 I had my wallet stolen and was at a loss,then you guys showed up.
 So I did that…
 You kinda feel sorryafter hearing his story.
 Then you should have said thatfrom the start!
 Ow! Huh…?
 What’s this?
 Don’t touch it!
 This is mine!
 Wh-What the…?!
 On your mark.
 Get set…
 Go!
 Weights?
 Try to catch me now, you idiots!
 Hey! He escaped again!
 That guy!
 He simply doesn’t get it!
 Is he for real?
 What a speed…!
 No way!Even we can’t catch up to him…?
 That’s it. We don't have a chanceof catching up.
 Dang it! He'll get itwhen I see him next time!
 All of you, thanks for coming.
 Begging your pardon!Begging your pardon!
 I was born and raisedin the Leaf Village in the Land of Fire.
 I was bathed in birth waterat “Ichiraku Ramen.”
 My given name is Narutoand the surname is Uzumaki.
 People call me--
 Loser!
 Loser…? Nah, not that!
 You’re funny as usual.
 Boss Jirocho,you're looking good yourself.
 Hey, Naruto!
 That's okay.A boy should be this spunky.
 The greetings seem to be done,so I’ll get to the main topic.
 The Fifth Hokage told us to getthe details of this mission from you.
 Yes, in fact…
 Do you know of the Dedication Ceremonyat the Todoroki Great Shrine?
 To…Todo…what?
 Well, make yourselves comfortable.
 The legend goes…
 A long time ago,in order to subdue a storm,
 Ryuko’s Jewels were dedicatedto the Todoroki Great Shrine
 and the storm subsided.
 It became a customary eventthat happens once every four years.
 At first, it was just to dedicate the jewels,but several decades ago,
 it became a festival in whichthe first-place runner
 became the man of the year.
 In recent years, the festival hastaken on another face.
 For ages now,in this port town of Degarashi,
 two families,the Wasabi and the Wagarashi,
 have controlled local operationsand policed the town.
 It’s embarrassing,
 but conflict between the two familieshas never ceased and
 there have been numerous skirmishesover territorial rights.
 As the struggle intensified,
 the town residents became entangledand even got injured…
 In order to put a stop to the conflict,for the first time,
 there was talk of some kind of mediationin the presence of the lord.
 And it was agreed that the power holderof the town
 would be determined in a contestrather than through brawls.
 So that contest is…
 It is the Todoroki Great ShrineDedication Ceremony
 that is held every four years.
 Four years ago, the Wagarashieasily won by hiring a Shinobi,
 and we have learned thatthey've hired a Shinobi again this year.
 In order to counteract that,
 we sent messengers tothe Hidden Leaf Village with a request,
 but they were ambushed and attacked.
 I beg you guys!
 Please lend us your power.
 We cannot afford to lose this raceto the Wagarashi Family!
 Leave it to me!
 And, who do you want usto escort?
 Oh, so you’ll take this job?
 Did you call for me, Boss?
 Oh, you guys know each other?Then that makes the story fast.
 That might not actuallybe the case…
 Boss Jirocho is an important person!
 By rights, he shouldn’t bowhis head to Ninja like you!
 Even if he did bow his head,I’d flatly refuse to escort a guy like you.
 Oh yeah?!
 As if I’d go with some guy who camefrom who-knows-where!
 ""Some guy from who-knows-where""?!
 I am the brilliant Ninja,Naruto Uzumaki,
 who will eventually inheritthe name of Hokage!
 Hah! Hokage is no big deal!
 Hah! The boss of hooligansis even less of a big deal!
 You idiot! Boss Jirocho isa very honorable person!
 The Hokage is a great Shinobi
 who puts his life on the lineto protect the village!
 Boss Jirocho is a very,very, very honorable person
 who always puts his lifeon the line to protect the town!
 Hokage is more, more,more incredible!
 Even though it’s a tourist resort,everything seems so expensive.
 Sorry about that.lt sure is expensive, isn't it?
 Oh no, I didn’t mean…
 We actually don’t want to sellat this kind of price,
 but after the Wagarashi familycame into power…
 P-Please forgive me!
 How dare you?!
 Do you know who you haveto thank to do business?
 Are you actually thinking about turningagainst the Wagarashi Family?
 N-Not at all.But I have to get paid…
 You’re slow to understand.
 – Hey! 					– Yes, sir!
 P-Please stop!
 Huh! First of all, we’ll destroy you…
 Wh-Who are you?!
 Get out of here before you get hurt!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Please run away!
 These people are fromthe Wagarashi…
 It’ll be fine.
 – You punk! 					– Wise guy!
 We’ll let you go for today!
 If you’ve learned your lesson,never defy us again, kid!
 Or you’ll pay whenwe see you next time!
 – Y-You won’t get away with this!– Y-You won’t get away with this!
 Young man…
 Thank you very much.
 What a refreshing feeling!
 We definitely need Boss Jirocho'sWasabi Family to win the upcoming race.
 Sasuke…
 Yeah…
 Boss…
 Of all people,did you have to ask the Leaf Shinobi?
 Don’t sulk like that, Idate.
 I'm not sulking.
 It’s just that…
 Idate…
 I believe in you morethan anybody else.
 The rest depends on you.
 Why don’t you believein people a little?
 Idate…
 please run for this town.
 I beg you!
 Boss…
 Okay.
 Even in exchange for my life…
 Wow, I didn’t think it was goingto be this big!
 But what kind of race is it?
 I’ll explain the course soa dummy like you can understand.
 The starting point is Degarashi Port.
 After the start, you head forModoroki Shrine which is the midway point.
 This is Modoroki Shrine…?
 Yes… It seems the fastest wayto get to Modoroki Shrine
 is to use a boat from here.
 Then you take one of two Ryuko's jewelsfrom Modoroki Shrine and
 dedicate that jewel at theTodoroki Great Shrine on Ouzu Island.
 That's the only rulefor the race.
 So shortcuts, obstructions,and secret maneuvers are all allowed.
 So hiring a Ninja is nota violation of the rule either.
 Who are the Ninja thatthe other side hired?
 They’re hiding somewhereand checking the situation.
 Don’t be careless, Naruto!
 R-Right!
 You guys can just relax and watch.Don’t follow me around!
 What?!
 I’m saying I don’t wantan impediment.
 You!
 Calm down.Let’s join forces here.
 – Not with a guy like this!– Not with a guy like this!
 They seem to strangely bein harmony, these two.
 All right, everybody!
 The Todoroki Great Shrine Racewill start soon!
 Wasabi Family's runner,ldate Morino!
 Idate…Morino?
 Wagarashi Family’s runner,Fukusuke Hikyakuya!
 On your mark!
 Start!
 All right! We’re going too!
 Wh-What the--?!
 Is he running away?!
 Where are you going, Idate?!
 Hey, wait!
 Wh-What is he doing…?
 Wait!
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 What the heck is he thinking?!That idiot!
 So fast. He's moving atan incredible speed.
 Darn it! The opponent's alreadyfar out at sea!
 This is bad!
 If the distance between them getsany greater, it'll be impossible to win!
 That idiot!
 – Kick it up a notch, Sakura!– Right!
 We're gonna bring him back at all costand make up the difference!
 Next time: ""The Race is On!Trouble on the High Seas!""
 Don't miss it!

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,

 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 Laughing Shino
 Shino! 					Let’s rest a little!
 I’m tired from doing nothing butwalk since this morning, believe it!
 You’re okay whileyou can say you are tired.
 It’s because you still haveenergy left to talk.
 Nothing but quibbling as usual…
 Man, I’m unlucky.
 To be stuck on a mission alonewith Shino.
 Hey, old lady.
 Is Motoyoshi Village still far ahead?
 Are you going to Motoyoshi Village?
 Yeah!
 Then you’ll be right thereonce you cross this path.
 Really? Thank goodness.
 But exercise great caution…
 Huh?
 Dead people also laughin Motoyoshi Village…
 It will be all over ifyou’re lured into laughing.
 Naruto.
 It’s Motoyoshi Village.
 We never imagined it at this time…
 To think that in this village…
 an incident too terrifying toeven talk about would occur…
 In Mourning
 I’m Futa Kagetsu, the chief mourner.
 I’m Shino Aburame.
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki!
 Will		Getting right down to business…
 This is the will of my father,Tobei Kagetsu.
 What’s this?!
 My eldest son, Futa Kagetsu,
 shall inherit the entireKagetsu family estate…
 HOWEVER…
 A funeral is to be held tomorrowin Motoyoshi Village
 for the head of the Kagetsu familythat owns that stretch of mountains.
 I’d like you two to go.
 Funeral security, huh?Naruto can’t do it.
 What do you mean?!
 It’s because you havethe most inappropriate face
 in the Leaf Village.
 Say what?!
 I think so as well.
 But there’s nobody else.
 So I reluctantly decidedto add Naruto.
 You’ll be the main guyon this mission, Shino.
 You're probably the best suitedfor this mission.
 Huh?
 As it happens,
 there’s one more important missionin addition to security.
 You’ll understand whenyou see the will.
 However, in the event that Futa raiseshis voice in laughter at the funeral,
 he shall lose inheriting rightsand upon consultation,
 the estate shall be divided up betweenthe bereaved family members excluding Futa.
 This will doesn’t make any sense at all…
 An abundance of medicinal herbscan be picked in the mountains
 owned by the Kagetsu family.
 I would have no trouble gettingby for the rest of my life
 if I were to inherit the estate.
 But all that will all go down the drainjust by laughing at the funeral!
 There’s no doubt that the relativeswill be in a frenzy
 trying to get me to laugh tomorrow.
 To be honest,
 I don’t have the confidenceto withstand it.
 But there is one salvation!
 According to the will,
 it’s acceptable if I, the chief mourner,were to appoint a substitute!
 And so I commissioned the Leaf!
 I asked for someone whoabsolutely will not laugh!
 This is no doubt the perfect missionfor Shino.
 I’ve never seenthis guy laugh before.
 Indeed, I leave it to you.
 I understand.
 Big Brother, dinner’s ready.
 This is my little sister Mai,the youngest.
 She lived together withmy father in this large home.
 She was also the one at his deathbedduring his final moments.
 Mai, this is Shino and Naruto.
 Nice to meet you…
 Let’s eat!
 Wait!
 First, I’ll taste for poison.
 Taste for poison…?!
 I don’t think there would be anyoneamong the relatives
 who would go that far…
 But you can never be too careful.
 You’ve got a point.
 Will you be all right, Shino?
 No problem.Even if it did contain poison,
 the Parasitic Insects inmy body will dissolve it for me.
 Parasitic…lnsects?
 How is it?
 It's all right…
 Shino…laughed?!
 He seems to be in very high spirits.Which means the food is fine…
 Don’t eat!
 Shino laughing likethis is definitely strange, believe it!
 There’s a laughing drug in this food!
 Who cooked the food?
 I did.
 But the back door isn’t locked…
 So anyone could get in if they wanted to.
 To think there would besomeone in the family
 who would go so far as to poison!
 Oh, no…The drug has gotten to the insects!
 No good…They can’t dissolve the drug.
 Then what will we do aboutthe funeral tomorrow?!
 This is a sight that doesn’t seemof this world, believe it!
 Naruto!
 Even if we were tocontact the village now,
 we wouldn’t be in time…for the funeral…
 So Naruto!
 You…
 will have to participate in the funeralas the chief mourner’s substitute!
 No way…
 Naruto.
 I’m very uneasy, but I’ll be counting on you.
 I’m also very uneasy, believe it…
 Will you knock it off?! I can’t sleep!
 You’re early, Tsukiko.
 You’re already here, huh?
 It’s dad’s funeral, after all.I came here in great haste.
 Who’s that kid?
 This is Naruto whom I’ve asked tobe my substitute as chief mourner
 since I’m not feeling so well.
 Nice to meet you!
 That’s how it’s going to be,so I will be leaving just with the greetings.
 I see. But it sure is a troublesome will.
 To think you can’t inherit the estateif you laugh at the funeral…
 Be careful.
 She’s my immediate younger sisterin question, Tsukiko.
 Five years ago,she married into the next village over…
 But she’s probably the oneafter this estate the most.
 That kid will be a cinch.
 Each and every one of them…looks greedy…
 What’s that…?
 The monk has arrived.
 Why choose a monk like this,of all people?
 I have no knowledge of this!
 It’s a different person fromthe monk at the meeting.
 Don’t laugh…
 Don’t laugh…
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 Now then, allow me to begin.
 What was that sound?
 Wasn’t it the wind blowing?
 Naruto, did you not raise your voiceand laugh just now?
 No, I didn’t!I didn’t laugh at all, believe it!
 Mai, you heard it, right?
 I don’t know…
 I only heard the sound ofbarrels falling over.
 Well, fine.
 The funeral has only just begun.
 There are still plenty of chances…
 After all, the opponent is this kidwith a stupid look.
 I’m saved…
 Shino, huh? Thanks!
 That was a close shave…
 In order, please.
 Then I’ll go first.
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 No good… He won’t laugh at that...
 I’ll give it one more push.
 Don’t laugh…!
 I must not laugh!
 This kid is nothing.
 I’ll kill him with laughter withthat technique of mine…
 This guy also intends ondoing something, huh?
 No matter what he does,no way will I laugh!
 Kiyoyasu!
 –Kiyoyasu! 					–Kiyoyasu is…
 Here it comes…
 Whatever he hits me with. I…!
 I must not laugh!
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 A flower came out…
 Don’t laugh…!
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 Don’t laugh, don’t laugh, don’t laugh…
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 I won’t laugh…no matter what!
 He’s pretty tough…
 But how long can he hold on for?
 We’ll make him laugh by the timethe funeral ends without fail!
 That…old woman…
 Dead people also laughin Motoyoshi Village…
 It will be all over if you’re luredinto laughing.
 What’s she doing in a place like this?
 Who’s there?!
 Uh, oh!
 Oh, it’s you Mai…
 With this, it’s over!We’ll put this in everyone’s tea!
 But…
 Everything will go well with this!
 I don’t know about that.
 Who’re you?!
 Shino…
 I heard everything…
 How frustrating…
 If this guy would just laugh,I’d get some of the estate…
 Thank you indeed for today.Allow me to thank you all…
 in place of the chief mourner.
 With this, the mission is complete…
 It looks like it will somehowend all right.
 Once the monk goes home,the funeral will be over.
 Please wait!
 Please let my husband saythank you as well. Okay, dear.
 Hi! Thanks for coming today.
 Huh?
 Huh?
 Wh-What’s he going to do?!
 It was a very nice funeral.I was so moved!
 It’s tear-jerking.
 That Tsukiko…To think she would go this far.
 Naruto, if you can get through this,it will be over.
 Please withstand it…!
 It doesn’t hurt at all!
 I must remember something sadat a time like this!
 Why do I think of the Pervy Sageat a time like this?!
 All right, now is the timeto finish him off.
 This is awful!The tears are causing my face to collapse.
 What’re you talking about?
 Your face…is right here!
 N-No!
 Oh, no…
 Yes!
 What?
 D–Dad…
 You’re alive? Dad?!
 Stop it, Big Brother, Big Sister!
 Dad hates fighting!
 I’ve thought up a good joke.
 I’ve thought up a good joke, too.
 Who’re those kids…?Where’d they come from?
 I’d get dad to laugh, first!
 I will be the first! You stay out of it!
 Stop it! Fighting’s wrong!
 It’s as Mai says.Fighting’s wrong! Wrong.
 Futa! Tsukiko!
 –Futa?! 					–Tsukiko?!
 N-Now that you mention it…
 Yeah…They are indeed usfrom our childhood!
 Oh, fighting’s wrong! A kettle’s a kettle!
 My mom dislikes ponkan mandarins!
 Groping is wrong!Hot sake is where it’s at.
 My wife’s secret stash is kept in a safe.
 Between my legs…
 Ding, dong, ding.
 Yeah, ding-dong-ding.Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 Yeah, ding-dong-ding.Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 Ding-dong.
 –That’s right…–Ding-dong. Ding-dong.
 –When we were kids…–Ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 –Dad made us laugh a lot–Ding-dong-ding.
 –with his silly jokes…–Ding-dong.
 –lt’s been a long time–Ding. Ding.
 –since I laughed at dad’s jokes…–Dong-dong-dong. Dong
 –Dong-dong–This is it! This is what I wanted to see!
 Dad!
 Then who’s this?
 The laughter stopped.
 Shino!
 I’m sorry, everyone!
 But I didn’t think you’d all comeif it weren’t my funeral…
 Mai helped me out a bunchand this was the plan.
 Is that really you, Dad? You’re alive.
 Why’d you do this?!
 In the old days,before we knew that
 the medicinal herbs we could pickin the mountains would be profitable…
 We were poor…
 But we were bursting with laughter.
 However, we got rich from sellingthe medicinal herbs at a high price.
 And when we’d open our mouths,
 we’d start saying,“Money! Money! Money!”
 And the smiles vanished fromeveryone’s faces.
 I wanted everyone to rememberwhat’s important.
 I wanted to get backthe family’s smiling faces!
 If I wrote that ridiculous will,
 everyone would do stupid thingstrying to get Futa to laugh.
 And then not only Futa,but everyone would laugh and have fun…
 Happiness isn’t money!
 It’s living while getting alongwith everyone and laughing!
 I remember…
 Sure enough, laughter is important.
 That’s right…
 To be honest, I’m sick of livingat the mercy of money.
 You liar! You’re the one sayingmoney this and money that the most.
 There are different kinds of “money,”and what I was talking about was…
 This bell.
 Could that be…?
 It’s the laughing drug.
 It’s still at experimental stage, though.
 If I made it okay to appointa substitute chief mourner,
 Futa would summon someonewho definitely wouldn’t laugh.
 So I tested it out on that person first.
 I was going to make everyone laughby putting this in everyone’s tea
 if nobody had laughed bythe end of the funeral.
 But…
 There’s no point to laughterusing a drug…
 It’s because the peoplewouldn’t be laughing
 from the bottom of their hearts.
 Instead, they’d be crying in their hearts…
 Like me right now!
 So at the end of the day,what happened with the mission?
 It's probably a success.
 It’s because the Lady Hokage probablyknew about the real mission.
 Say-say.
 You transformed into that old man, right?
 Then the “Between my legs,ding-dong-ding” thing was something you…
 Forget about that.
 Absolutely forget about that.
 O-Okay, got it.
 Then, fine.
 Sure enough, I…
 I can’t get used to this guy…
 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 The mission this time around isa commission from the Land of Greens
 and is protection forsome traveling merchants.
 This is just a D-rank mission.
 Don’t complain. The castle lord thereis a benefactor of mine.
 Make sure you do nothing wrong.
 I could manage a mission likethat asleep, believe it.
 Very well.
 However, I’ve got an important reminderfor you.
 Reminder?
 Make sure you don’t forget to take thiswith you to the site.
 That is all.

211,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 The distance created between usbecame too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouthmakes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile,even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Who are you guys?
 They want to fight, it seems.
 I won’t be fooled. 					You…you…
 Todoroki!
 Stop it, Todoroki!
 You said you were going to deliverGantetsu to the capital, right?
 This guy… There’s no wayI’ll forgive this guy!
 What are you talking about?
 This guy…killed my family…he killed my little brother!
 Wh-What was that…?
 Gantetsu killed your family?
 Yeah.
 Five years ago.
 I’m positive thatthis is the guy I saw.
 Fire…!
 Oh!
 This is horrible…
 Is anybody still inside?
 Damn!
 Father! Mother!
 Akio.
 Akio!
 Memory of Flames
 Akio…
 Todoroki, I found out whoattacked your family.
 Really?
 A gang of bandits calledthe Ninja Dropouts.
 Ninja Dropouts?
 They’re ruthless…Evil personified…
 When they rob the victimsof money and valuables…
 They massacre everyone in that house.
 Why?
 So as not to leave any witnesses behind.
 The bodies of your parentswere found but…
 The fire spread quickly andAkio was still small so…
 Probably nothing of him remained.
 I’m sorry, but you need tolet your little brother go…
 That’s impossible.
 I can't do that.
 Damn it!
 It’s ironic, isn’t it…
 When I finally find the killerof my parents and little brother…
 My mission…forces meto escort him to the capital.
 Todoroki.
 I’m a full-fledged police officer now.I’m not a spring chicken!
 I didn’t mean to bringmy personal grudges onto the job…
 This guy will eventuallybe sentenced to death…
 That thought has allowed me to endure.
 But, right now,right in front of my eyes…
 The same face in the flame…The face that killed my little brother!
 Your…little brother?!
 Die, Gantetsu!
 –Don’t get in my way!–Stop!
 He’s a thug who’s killedcountless innocent people.
 It’s your mission to deliver Gantetsuto the capital, right?!
 It doesn’t matter!He killed my little brother!
 It may be true that Gantetsu is evil, but…
 You can’t do that…
 There’s nobody watching…
 That’s right, here in the middleof this forest.
 H-Hey, Todoroki?
 Nobody’s watching…There’s no way they’ll know.
 Todoroki… I said, calm down!I’m telling you, I’m watching!
 No, nobody’s watching…
 Todoroki!
 As long as you keep your mouth shut…
 No… Better yet, if you weren’t around…
 Wait a second!
 What the heck are you thinking?Calm down!
 I'm extremely calm.
 You too must…
 It can’t be helped…
 If things come to this,I guess I have no choice but to fight!
 What’s the matter?
 Why don’t you just comeright out and fight?!
 You guys, too! Why don’t you stop hiding?Come out and show yourselves!
 Huh?
 Y-You guys are…
 Stop bullying Gantetsu!
 Give Gantetsu back!
 What is this?
 I have no idea…Who the heck are they?
 Everybody!
 W-Wait a minute…
 How are you connectedto Gantetsu…?
 Stop that!
 Let’s get out of here!
 Calm down.
 We should be able tounderstand each other
 if we just try to talk things over.
 You guys aren’t Shinobi, are you?!
 It’s dangerous for amateursto hold blades!
 Lee, what are we gonna do?
 This is a problem…
 ‘Cause if our opponents are amateurs,we can’t go all out…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Damn it! Let go of me!
 I need to avenge the deathsof my family…and my little brother!
 Calm down!
 Calm down and think aboutthis whole thing again!
 Your…little brother?
 Don’t be stupid, Gantetsu…Don’t come over here right now!
 Gantetsu!
 What's going on?!
 Damn it, I can’t move!
 It’s futile.
 That string is stronger than steel.
 There’s no way you’ll be ableto cut through it
 with human strength alone.
 Who the heck are you?
 I’m Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
 Ninja Dropout you said?
 I, Monju will take Gantetsu.
 As long as I have him,I have no more business with you guys.
 Those nets will shrinkas the temperature rises.
 So you’ll suffer till the end.
 In half an hour or so…
 It will cut you into pieces.
 Farewell!
 Todoroki!
 Gantetsu!
 Damn it… I’m not about to diein a place like this.
 Our mission is to deliverGantetsu to the capital…
 Are you an idiot ?Take a good look at this situation!
 We’ll be goners before that happens.
 I don’t believe that those Ninja Dropoutsare Gantetsu’s comrades.
 Gantetsu was telling the truth.Those guys might kill Gantetsu.
 That’s why I should have killed himwith my own hands!
 But remember, that guy wascalling out your name to the very end!
 So what’s up with that?!
 There must be somethinghe wanted to tell you!
 I don’t want to hearany excuses from a thug!
 I find it hard to believe thatGantetsu’s that evil a guy.
 What was that?!
 I’m telling you,I’m not about to kick the bucket
 until I’ve heard what Gantetsuwanted to say!
 Stop it!
 Hey, I’m positive we can workthings out if we just talk.
 Shut up!
 Wait. 					Let’s stop this.
 I just assumed you were a Ninja Dropout,because you’re a Ninja.
 We’re Shinobi from the Leaf Village.
 We were called here to bepart of the police escort
 taking Gantetsu to the capital.
 Please spare Gantetsu.
 That can’t happen.
 Gantetsu saved us fromthe Ninja Dropouts.
 Saved you?
 Who in the world are you guys?
 We’re all kids whose familieswere killed by the Ninja Dropouts.
 But Gantetsu secretly rescued us
 because he wanted to saveat least the children…
 What was that?!
 Gantetsu took care of all of us kidswho had become orphans…
 Gantetsu.
 Is it the Ninja Dropouts again?
 I’m sorry.
 Where am I?
 So you woke up.
 Mother…? Father…?
 Where’s Mother?
 You poor thing…But we’re all in the same boat.
 You’re not alone…We’re here for you…
 We’re your new family.
 I’m leaving the Ninja Dropouts!
 I can’t stand this any longer.
 I can’t commit robberies withthose guys anymore.
 But if you don’t,they’ll kill you, Gantetsu.
 I’ll steal their money.
 Huh?
 And I’ll get myself capturedby the police.
 Come on…
 If I do that,
 they’ll show up in front ofthe prison to try to get me back.
 That’s the only waythey can be captured.
 Are you saying you’re gonnabe a decoy…?
 It's so that there won’t beany more victims.
 This is my only choice.
 Gantetsu really did steal their moneyand was captured by the police.
 We came to this forest
 because we were worriedabout Gantetsu’s safety.
 We were praying that the Ninja Dropoutswould get caught. However…
 So Gantetsu reformed himself
 and betrayed the Ninja Dropouts, right?
 We have to do something aboutthe real evil, the Ninja Dropouts!
 I don’t really care aboutthe Ninja Dropouts right now.
 What’s important is thatwe rescue Gantetsu.
 I’m guessing that Gantetsuis with Naruto.
 Don’t worry because he won’t havebeen captured by the Ninja Dropouts.
 Okay, let’s believe that.
 Damn…
 If things continue like this,we’ll turn into dried fish.
 Huh?
 H-Hey… It loosens up a littlewhen sweat soaks into it.
 What?
 Are you serious?
 Oh, you’re right.
 Yeah, I know…
 What?!
 I’m used to its venom.lt’s nothing.
 I find it hard to believethat Gantetsu’s that evil a guy.
 I’m gonna meet up with Gantetsuone more time
 and find out for myself,no matter what it takes…
 That’s right…I need to see Gantetsu again, too.
 I will then avenge the deathsof my family…and of my little brother.
 We did it!
 That was a narrow escape!
 All right… Let’s hurry up andrescue Gantetsu!
 Yeah… I will find him no matter whatand I'll cut him down!
 Huh?
 –Gantetsu. 					–Huh?
 That’s definitely Gantetsu.
 Those guys are…
 I-Idiot…
 –Gantetsu! 					–Gantetsu!
 Gantetsu!
 That’s as far as you’ll go, kid.
 That guy is…
 Don’t tell me he’s a Ninja Dropout?!
 Good answer.
 I’m Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
 Give Gantetsu back!
 I’m not forgiving you for this!
 Hey, hey…
 Who are these little brats?
 Perhaps they’re inexperiencedin the ways of the world, but…
 to tell me to give Gantetsu back…
 Give us back what we want.That’s our line, right?
 Who the heck are you guys?
 You Ninja Dropout jerks…
 We are avenging our families’ deaths!
 What?!
 You brats just stay quiet.
 Damn it!
 Stop! Monju! Let that kid go!
 It looks like you don’t quite comprehendthe position you’re in right now, huh?!
 And moreover, what do they meanby avenge, huh, Gantetsu?!
 Stop!
 Ninja Art: Mesh Cage!
 It’s my turn!
 It doesn’t even budge.
 It’s useless… You won’t be able totear through this net.
 Come on, Gantetsu, answer me.
 I refuse.
 Huh… I see.
 Then how about this?
 Akio!
 Stop it! I get it.I’ll talk, so please stop!
 You should have done thatfrom the start.
 These children are the childrenfrom the homes
 that we, the Ninja Dropouts, attacked.
 I rescued them and gave them shelter.
 What? You betrayed us?
 I see… You jerk…
 You took our treasures andgave them to these guys.
 They belonged to their familiesin the first place.
 Don’t mess around with me…You traitor!
 Stop that!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting!
 Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!
 Naruto!
 Naruto, you were safe!
 Of course I was!
 I’m not handing Gantetsu overto you no matter what!
 Gantetsu.
 That’s…
 It can’t be…!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Is that the Ninja Dropout’s hideout?
 Yes, Akio is probably in that mansion.
 Damn those Ninja Dropout bastards.I can never forgive them.
 How dare they interfere withthe happy reunion of the siblings!
 This is outrageous.
 All right, let’s go, Bushy-Brows!
 I’m always okay to go.Even if the enemy is an ex-Shinobi…
 We’re going to beat them one and all,
 and definitely going to getTodoroki’s brother back!

 A Dubious Offer!Tsunade's Choice
 Not good…
 Dang it! Dang it!This time for sure…no matter what!
 You’re the only one who can treatLord Orochimaru’s arms.
 Why don’t we make a deal?
 I’ll resurrect the little brotherand man, both of whom you loved…
 with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.
 Don’t you want to see those two,Tsunade…?
 No! You must not believein their sweet talk…
 Their wishes…Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…
 And dreams…Did you forget them?!
 I’ll be straight with you.
 Tsunade, the village has demandedthat you become the Fifth Hokage.
 The successive line of Hokages
 have protected the Leaf Villageand those living in it.
 They brought troubled times under control
 and helped the village to prosper.
 They risked their lives forthis dream, this ideal!
 You don’t have to answer right now.
 However, I want it in a week.
 Also, two human sacrifices areneeded for this Forbidden Jutsu,
 so do what you need to doto prepare them.
 We are starting!
 C’mon. Place your bets!
 Which will you bet on, ma’am?
 Which one? C’mon!
 Which one will she choose?
 If she agrees to our conditions,
 your arms will be healed,
 and the destruction of the Leaf Villagewill continue immediately.
 Lady Tsunade will also be able tobe reunited with the two whom she loves.
 But if she doesn’t agree…
 I’ll have to force her to heal my arms…
 Will it really be that easy?
 I have you.
 There’s no need to worry.
 I’m the one who knows her the best.
 And her greatest weakness!
 She’ll definitely accept the conditions…Definitely!
 Listen, in this third step,
 you’ve got to use 100%of what you have learned…
 And retain them.
 In other words,
 imagine creating a single layerwithin the balloon
 and compressing the Chakra inside it.
 I know that in my head…
 But no matter what,
 I can’t completely hold 100%of my power in a neat ball…
 Don’t give him false hope by teaching himsomething he can't master.
 That’s why the moony kidstarts joking about becoming a Hokage!
 Tomorrow, huh.
 Come again, okay?
 I certainly will!
 Are you going to meetOrochimaru again?
 To think she’d be that shaken up…
 Something extreme must have happened.
 That one week bugs me, somehow…
 And Naruto hasn’t come backto the inn for nearly a week.
 I guess I’ll press Tsunade a little more.
 No good…
 No good… Why?
 Here there’s no time…lt’ll be too late.
 What’s this…?!
 What happened, Naruto?!
 Are you okay?
 What do you want?
 The moon’s out.
 How about going out for a drink?
 Tomorrow will be the one weekyou promised to Naruto.
 I wonder what became of Naruto?
 Beats me.
 I guess I’ll have something.
 Radish, please.
 Coming up.
 Oh?
 Here you go.
 Ooh! This looks good.
 Lady Tsunade!
 What happened to Naruto?
 He’s quite exhausted and weakened.
 And his right hand is severely burnedwith Chakra…
 As it stands now,
 this kid probably won’t wake upuntil the day after tomorrow.
 It’s as Jiraiya says…
 Why did I make such a stupid bet?
 What am I, of all people,getting so worked up for?
 How stupid.
 Tomorrow…
 Please don’t go tomorrow!
 Why don’t you say anything?!
 Lady Tsunade! Please don’t be silent.Please answer!
 If you say that you’re going…
 What will you do?
 I’ll stop you with my life!
 Shizune… Have you forgottenwho you’re talking to?
 Sir! It’s morning, now!lt’s about time you went home!
 Geez.
 Hey! Get up, sir…
 Hey! What’s wrong, you?!
 It’ll be troublesome if we’re disturbedduring the negotiations…
 What do you want me to do?
 It might be good to kill…Tsunade’s attendant.
 It seems that you…
 You don’t trust me completely…yet.
 Precisely because I trust you…
 I would like to leave Sasukein your hands.
 Well, then…
 Kabuto…
 If you wish to stop me…
 You have no choicebut to kill young Sasuke, now.
 You can’t possibly kill me…
 Hey!
 I said hey!
 Naruto…?
 Oh no! What time is it?No, what day is it?
 It’s Monday…
 What is it?
 Is your body okay?
 As I recall, you were supposedto sleep for two full days…
 No matter what the wound,
 I’m always able to recoverif I sleep one night!
 That’s right.This kid has Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…
 More importantly,where’s that stupid old woman?!
 Today’s the promised bet day.
 Then, what about the Jutsu…
 It’s still not complete, but I can wing it…Believe it!
 That’s right. This isn’t the time for this.
 – Naruto, please stay…– Huh?
 You are…!
 What?! Oh!
 Wait, Shizune!
 That darned Tsunade spiked my drink.
 I can’t build up my Chakra well…
 And my body is so numb,I can barely throw a Kunai Knife.
 What was he gonna doif that had hit me?!
 That’s lame! Here you’re always braggingabout how you’re this awesome Ninja!
 And you’re nailed by her perverted attack?You, Pervy Pervy Sage?!
 Shut up!
 Even if she’s rotten,she’s still a medical specialist.
 She’s the only one who could concocta tasteless and odorless drug for Ninja.
 But to think I’d be caught off-guard,
 no matter how intoxicated I was…
 I’m going to kill you, bastard!
 How are you feeling,Master Jiraiya?
 Quite a bit better than this morning I guess.
 But be that as it may,maybe around thirty percent…
 I never thought I’d end up encounteringthat Master Jiraiya in a place like this…
 Things have gotten difficult.I guess I’ll pull back for now.
 At any rate, Naruto…To think you’d be here, too…
 Hey! Shizune.
 Y-Yes?!
 It’s about time you tell me
 what the heck she was talking aboutwith Orochimaru.
 Orochimaru?!
 I wanted to believe Lady Tsunade…
 That’s why I couldn’t say until now.
 But…
 There’s no time.Please come with me!
 I’ll explain as we run!
 Okay!
 I’m going, too!
 What’s your answer?
 Say what?!
 The answer to that is definitely no!
 This might be really bad…
 She’s probably still thinkingof those two.
 Perhaps I may have no choice,but to kill Tsunade…
 Dang it!
 I’ll heal your arms…
 In exchange for that,keep your hands off the village.
 Very well.
 Now then…
 He’s planning to once again attack
 the Leaf Village ifhis arms are healed!
 The situation will geteven more dangerous than that
 if he’s not stopped now.
 Him screwing around like that!
 I have you.There’s no need to worry…
 What’s the meaning of this?
 To think you’d betray me at this point…
 Tsunade!
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 What the hell is this?! This castlehas been destroyed even further!
 It seems Tsunade hasdeclined the deal.
 But…but the old lady is not here!
 Calm down a second.She shouldn't have gone far from here.
 Oh, some incredible noisefrom that direction, Pervy Sage!
 Well, well…she started a flashy battle.

 In that case, take me down!
 If I were the wimp I was in the past,
 I would probably havetold you the truth.
 Arashi!
 No! The old Arashi is dead!
 The person you see hereis just a block of flesh
 kept alive byNinja Art: Cadaver Puppets!
 Sakura, please look after Sasame!
 Stop it, Naruto! Don’t fight with Arashi!
 No!
 This guy isn’t the same gentle Arashiyou once knew, Sasame!
 Jigumo! Go!
 No!
 Sasame! I'm sorry!
 Over here!
 Naruto!
 Don’t, Sakura!
 Kamikiri…!
 Finish him!
 Naruto!
 You’re…next…!
 Sakura!
 That was close…
 I almost let my guard down.
 Just when you had a chanceto launch a sneak attack.
 You blew it, didn’t you, Naruto?
 Naruto!
 All because of that ball and chain…!
 Ball and chain…?!
 Naruto… I'm sorry!
 That’s not true at all!
 This kind of injury…
 is nothing…at all!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 If there’s three on your side,
 I'll go with five on mine!
 Kamikiri!
 Naruto!
 Are you all right?!
 You’re badly hurt…
 Sakura… This injury is nothing!
 “Sakura…This injury is nothing!”
 Stop it! If you say more than that…!
 I won’t say more! I’ll bring this to an end.
 Kamikiri! Jigumo!
 Give me your Chakra…
 Boar, Dog, Rat,Rat, Snake, Rooster, Dog,
 Dog, Monkey, Dragon,Boar, Boar, Rat, Boar, Dragon…
 Why does Arashi know that technique?
 It’s a Hidden Jutsu that only the past chiefsof the Fuma clan could use…
 What was that?!
 Fuma Ninja Art:
 Spell of the Mandala!
 This ain’t good!
 Naruto!
 What the heck is this?!
 This is the end!
 What?!
 Naruto!
 The Chakra cage gradually shrinks…
 And the human enclosed thereinis crushed to the size of a tiny nugget.
 You can’t break it.
 As long as I myself do notdissolve the Jutsu.
 Naruto!
 I’m incapable of doing anything…
 There’s nothing I’m capable of doing…
 The person I am now isn’t…
 capable of doing anything!
 Arashi!
 Sasame…
 You!
 Sasame!
 Please…come to your senses…
 Become the old Arashi again!
 I told you, already!
 The old Arashi is dead.
 Arashi…
 I’m sorry, Sasame…
 I wanted power…
 I wanted the Fuma Clan to finda place in the sun once again…
 Yes! I understand that!I understand that!
 But, enough now…Let’s go home.
 Let’s go back to the village.
 But, I’m just a mere monster now…
 That’s not true!
 This is agony…
 Sassme…
 Please… kill me…
 Please…kill…
 How dare you try to kill me!
 Arashi!
 You’ll…die!
 Sakura!
 Sakura?!
 You wanna be… the first to die?
 Sasame taught me that…
 dying isn’t anything to be scared of!
 I see…
 But what’s scary is to live one’s lifewithout having been able to do anything…
 I’m not afraid to die in the serviceof someone who is important to me!
 Don’t!
 I’m telling you…
 Whatever happens, you mustn’t die…No matter what! Sakura!
 Naruto!
 Give it up!
 What is it you think you’re capableof doing the way you are now?!
 That’s so useless!
 Vanish from this worldget crushed into nothing…!
 Sasame!
 Stop that, Arashi!
 Sasame…you!
 Naruto!
 Hey! Let go!
 No!
 Arashi?!
 I’m sorry, Sasame…
 I caused you so much hardship…
 No, you haven’t!
 The person who experiencedthe greatest hardship is you, Arashi!
 Is there anything I can do for you?
 What should I do for you?!
 You’ve already helped memore than enough…
 See… Thanks to you, Sasame,
 I was able to return to beingthe person I was in the past…
 Naruto!
 Sakura…
 Even if it’s to be of serviceto someone…
 There’s no life thatshould be lost for that!
 Yeah!
 Run! Sakura!
 Pervy Sage!
 Sorry to be late!
 I was faced with a number of obstacleson my end too!
 Gimme a break…
 Now then…Climb on, climb on!
 Hurry! Let’s get back above ground!
 Oops!
 Sasame!
 She’s fine… She just fainted.
 Naruto!
 Orochimaru assigned us a mission…
 To make sure nobody takes Sasuke back
 to the Village Hidden inthe Leaves under any circumstances!
 Then, Sasuke is…?!
 Yeah… He’s alive!
 Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke
 because he is his vital vessel whichhe will possess in three years!
 Arashi…
 Arashi… This place is gonna collapse!
 Hurry up and come over here!
 I’m already just a puppet…
 I cannot live my life anywhereexcept here.
 Arashi…
 All right!
 No! Arashi!
 Sasame…
 Thank you.
 Including Arashi,we’ve paid an extraordinary price but…
 The Fuma Clan has beenable to cut itself free
 from Orochimaru’s spell…
 You can start again anew.
 I will rebuild the Clan again without fail!
 With this life…that Arashi protected.
 Yeah!
 I am truly indebted to you.
 Sasame…
 Hanzaki, I’m leaving these twoin your hands!
 Yes, sir!Please take care along the road!
 I will.
 – Thank you!– We thank you!
 – Take care!– See you again!
 Hey! Hang in there!
 Well, we weren’t ableto find Sasuke,
 but at least we now knowthat he’s alive somewhere…
 We’ll have to settle for the factthat we were able to ascertain
 the new information that we still havea grace period of three years
 before he becomes a vesselto be possessed by Orochimaru.
 Yes…
 Sasame knew what she neededto do for her clan…
 But this time again all I did was cry.
 All I did was depend on Naruto…
 Sakura!
 You gave your best effort too!
 No, I was just a ball and chainto everyone…
 I wasn’t capable of doinganything alone…
 That’s not true!
 Seeing you give your best effortlike that gave me a lot of courage, Sakura.
 If you hadn’t been there, Sakura,I’d have been crushed just like that.
 It’s thanks to you, Sakura!
 Naruto…
 Wow, you’ve grown into someonewho can say that sort of thing!
 Oww! I’m an injured man!Treat me with a little more care!
 Oh yeah, that’s right!
 All I was thinking about at that timewas protecting someone I cared about…
 What I’m capable ofdoing right now…
 I was thinking…
 What?
 There are many variables suchas mission level,
 or platoon’s member structure…
 But no matter how smalla platoon might be,
 I think it’s important to assignone Medical Ninja to it…
 I know that already…
 I wrote exactly the same thingin a report long ago
 regarding the survival rate and missionachievement rate of small platoons.
 But it’s not that easy tonurture Medical Ninja.
 They require a different set of skillsthan that of fighting types Ninja…
 The minute perfectionof Chakra control,
 the ability to assimilate a huge volumeof specialized knowledge,
 the brains to apply that in a broad way…patience…
 And there is the most important thing
 for Shinobi who are to developinto a Medical Ninja…
 Well, I’m busy right now, so…
 The most important thing…huh?
 Hidden Leaf Hospital		 I’m all wrapped up in bandages again…
 This way I can’t evenhold chopsticks…
 Sakura, when it’s time formy meal, feed me, okay?
 I’ll open up my mouth just like this and…
 Huh? Sakura?
 I’m sorry! I was just joking!
 I’m sorry… Naruto…
 Huh?
 This is gonna mean thatI’ll keep you waiting a little but…
 Next time, I definitely won’t…
 be a ball-and-chain to you!
 Huh?
 Enter!
 I came here with a request!
 What is it?
 Please make me your apprentice!
 You’re very desperate, aren’t you?
 Sakura Haruno,
 I heard from Kakashi that you havea brilliant mind as well as will power!
 All right.
 But in exchange,I’m not gonna be easy on you!
 Yes, ma’am!
 This recent mission…
 looks like it wasn’t wastedon her, after all.
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 He makes me so angry,that Pervy Sage!
 Didn’t he say “I’ll make youmy disciple and hone your skills”?!
 When Sakura’s already becomethe Old Lady Tsunade's
 and is working so hard!
 And he just leaves me tomy own devices! Hey!
 All because he was assigneda mission by Old Lady Tsunade!
 If things come to this,
 I’m gonna give the Old Lady Tsunadea piece of my mind!

 The distance created between usbecame too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouthmakes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile,even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands

 Our two hearts
 No way…
 To think Old Man Hokage wouldtry to eliminate Yakumo.
 No way could that ever happen!
 But if by some remote chance,
 Kurenai Senseiaccepted such a mission…
 it would explain her strange behavior.
 No, no way!No way that could ever happen.
 Are you okay, Kurenai Sensei…?
 Yes. I feel quite a bit better nowthanks to your first-aid…
 Who in the world isKurenai Sensei protecting?
 It was the Third Hokage whotold her to take custody of Yakumo…
 What in the world is her real mission…?
 What's going on?!
 Th-That's…
 Th-The Village Hidden in the Leaves is…
 No way…!
 Genjutsu or Reality?
 It’s like the aftermath ofa large war that broke out.
 Hinata!
 Right…
 Byakugan!
 There’s not a person in the village…
 What is this…?
 What’s going on here?!
 Kiba, Hinata…ls there anything unusual in the area?
 No enemy signs anywhere…
 Akamaru doesn’t sensethe scent of any outsiders, either.
 What happened in the villagewhile we were away…?
 First, let’s take Yakumo andKurenai Sensei to the hospital.
 We’ll check out the village after that…
 R-Right…!
 Leaf Hospital
 What’s this…?
 Anyway, let’s get these twoto a hospital room…
 I’m okay.More importantly, take care of Yakumo.
 Right…
 You’re out of danger now…
 Oh, no…She’s unconscious!
 Her vital signs are weakening…
 I wonder if there’s any medicine left…
 Naruto, help me look…
 Oh, well, but…
 Just hurry!
 R-Right…
 There’s no scent of blood.
 Everyone must haveevacuated somewhere.
 Let’s us check out the village.
 Right…
 Make sure you threealways act together…
 Come back here in thirty minutes,no matter what.
 Right…
 What is it?
 Sure enough, you have to be the oneto give us orders, Kurenai Sensei!
 What’s been the matter with you?!
 The pharmacy is that way.
 Nothing. I was just concernedabout Kurenai Sensei…
 So let’s hurry and get the medicine!
 I mean, Kurenai Sensei’s going to…eliminate…Yakumo…
 Eliminate?
 Th-Th-That couldn’t be…
 I was just kind of out of it.
 Huh?
 Huh…? What was that?!
 What is it, Sakura?!
 There’s someone here other than us.
 What?!
 That’s close!
 I’ll leave the two inthe hospital room to you, Sakura!
 I’m going after him!
 Got it!
 Hold it! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Huh?! My Jutsu won’t activate?!
 Wait! This isn’t the timeto be fighting.
 You guys are the ones whoattacked the mountain cottage, right?!
 I am Unkai of the Kurama Clan…
 Kurama?!The same clan as Yakumo?!
 Why would her clan attack her?!
 Listen to me!lf you don’t, everyone will die!
 What's this smell of blood?!
 Byakugan!
 Close your Byakugan, Hinata!
 Kiba, restrain Akamaru’ssense of smell!
 –What?! 					–What is it?!
 It’s because we’re caughtin someone’s Jutsu.
 Say what?!
 Yes. We’re now insideYakumo’s Genjutsu.
 It may seem as if the Leaf Villagewas in a war.
 But this is merelya part of her Genjutsu.
 This whole Leaf Village is Genjutsuand we’ve all been trapped in it?
 That’s totally impossible!
 But if her latent powers have awakened,it wouldn’t be hard at all.
 This whole village?!
 This ground we’re standing on,this sky, everything is Genjutsu?!
 There are occasions whensuperior senses become a hindrance.
 It’s because no matter how superiorthe sense of sight or smell might be,
 ultimately it’s the human brain thatprocesses and perceives the information!
 There are times whenwell-developed brains make errors
 in the process of interpretingcomplex electric signals.
 However, insects act onlywith sharp senses.
 Unlike the information processedwith a human brain,
 insects narrow this information downto the very minimum.
 Look. My insectsare still under control.
 They will not be deceived.
 There are occasions when
 Yakumo’s Genjutsusummons thunderclouds
 and produces fire.
 And that is planted directly intothe human brain
 as if it had occurred in reality.
 And that causes the brainto hurt one’s own body.
 Then, Grandma’s house…
 That’s also Yakumo’s power?!
 It’s not just that…
 She can even kill people easilyif she were so inclined.
 But these tremors…
 Are you saying this is also Genjutsu?
 You’ll see any moment now…
 A-A snake!
 It’s too huge!
 Is that also Genjutsu?!
 It’s a terrifying image thatour cerebrums have created.
 Physical influence is absolutely…
 unthinkable!
 No way!
 Yakumo?! Kurenai Sensei?!
 Huh?!
 Really…? Yakumo can kill peoplewith Genjutsu..?
 So is that why the Third Hokagetried to eliminate her?
 Yakumo, Yakumo?!
 Kurenai Sensei, Kurenai Sensei…
 Over here… Kurenai Sensei…
 I still can’t believe it.
 To think Yakumo would dosomething like that!
 Once every several generations,
 a child is born into our Kurama Clanwith physical idiosyncrasies.
 That child is Yakumo…
 Moreover, what’s terrifying is herusing her powers unconsciously
 without being able to control it.
 It’s getting kind of hot.
 Don’t!
 What’s happeningoutside the door…?
 Don’t open it!
 Wh-What’s this…?
 Why’s there lava here…?
 That’s an illusion our brains havecreated due to Yakumo’s Genjutsu.
 But even it’s an illusion,if we were to dive into the lava,
 our brains would determine it to be lavaand our bodies would burn up.
 That is Yakumo’s power.
 So is that why Old Man Hokageand Kurenai Sensei
 tried to eliminate Yakumo?
 That’s not it.
 What they reallyattempted to kill
 was the monsterexisting inside Yakumo.
 A monster?
 Before too long,Yakumo’s massive powers
 created a terrifying monster.
 If left alone, the monster thatcontinues to grow would
 someday attempt tobecome one with her
 by absorbingYakumo’s consciousness.
 The Third Hokage and Kurenaidetermined as such
 and all there was to do in orderto save Yakumo was to seal her powers.
 A monster in her body…
 So that’s what it was…
 I can’t just sit back like this!
 Oh!
 Oh. My entire fortune!
 I told you. If you dive into the lava,you’re body will really burn up.
 Then does that meanwe can’t get out of here?!
 No, there is one way.
 What’s that way?!
 If you seal your five senses,the Genjutsu cannot affect the body.
 You must escape from this worldand attack Yakumo!
 What?! Attack Yakumo?!
 Ow-ow-ow!
 What? This is…Satomi Hill?!
 Old Man Unkai!
 It seems you safely made itout of Yakumo’s Genjutsu…
 What the heck happened…?!
 At the point you brought Yakumoout of the mountain cottage,
 you were alreadycaught in her Genjutsu.
 What?!
 Guys! Get a hold of yourselves!
 Kiba!
 Shino!
 Wh-Where are we…?
 Sakura, examineOld Man Unkai’s wounds.
 Unkai…?
 What happened?!These are awful burns!
 We were able to get out ofYakumo’s Genjutsu
 thanks to this old man!
 Rather, I’d saywe were driven out…
 Her only target wasYuhi Kurenai, after all…
 Where’s Kurenai Sensei now?
 Well, probably…
 Yakumo…
 Kurenai Sensei…What do you think of my paintings…?
 Aren’t they wonderful?!
 What did you do to everyone?
 Don’t worry…I just drove out the intruders…
 Eventually, I must have my revengeon the Leaf Village…
 But first, I have some businesswith you, Sensei.
 Why include the Leaf Village as well…?
 I should be enough of a targetfor your revenge…!
 I won’t let you sayyou don’t know!
 How is it? 					Awesome, huh?
 I have complete control now of lettingyou live or killing you, Sensei.
 Tell me the truth…
 It was the Third Hokage who orderedmy father and mother killed and
 the Kurama Clan and me eliminatedfrom the Leaf Village, right?
 No.
 The Third Hokage did not ordersuch a mission…
 Why do you lie?!
 Please.
 Tell me the truth!
 You’ll vanish if you don’t,Kurenai Sensei…
 Such a sad child…
 If killing me will eliminate your suffering,then you should do it.
 If your hate will vanish alongwith your suffering!
 Why do you cry?I won’t be deceived by tears like that!
 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005!
 Yeah, it feels good inevery kind of weather to sweat.
 So the Kurama Clan are still here!Might Guy will take you on!
 W-Wait, Guy!
 Huh?! G-Guy?
 I see. So you guys were alsocaught in the Kurama Genjutsu…
 I’m sorry.
 Well, you’re alive andthat’s all that matters.
 Thank goodness,thank goodness.
 Oh, you guys are back!
 Where are the village reinforcements?!
 There’s no time to explain!
 What?!
 Oh, hey! Wait, you guys!
 What’s up with them?!
 Who’s that man…?And what about everyone?
 Please, just help me out, Guy Sensei.
 But, well…
 Just hurry!
 R-Right…
 Byakugan!
 Those jerks…
 No, Yakumo!
 Yakumo and Kurenai Senseiare in the innermost room.
 All right!
 Hey, wait!
 Kiba!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door

 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door

 Everyone, what’s the current situation?
 Naruto hasn’t come backsince he first went in.
 The insects had also detectedsomething strange and emerged.

 Was there some kind ofspecial ingredient in it or something…?
 Not…bad…

 Did he really…fall asleep…?
 You fell for it, eh?!
 It looked like I was sleeping,but actually I wasn’t!
 This is the Shinobi secret…!
 Guy Sensei…I did it!
 Guy Sensei…I…I…
 You fell for it yet again, huh?!Hey!
 You’re sorely mistakenif you think I’m the kind of person
 to sleep spread-eaglein a place like this!
 I…I…
 What…? What am I doingin a place like this…?
 What…?
 Why…? Why…?
 Alcohol…?
 He’s just drunk, huh…?
 If so…I’ll send you to another worldbefore you can even feel pain…
 Damn it…I don’t have enough Chakra…
 At this rate…
 As might be expected,things will get hairy
 if I stay in the water any longerwith this wound…
 Why won’t it hit?!
 And here I was sleeping comfortably…
 You’re a buzzing, annoying fly!
 Hey! Bring it on! Hey c’mon…I’ll show you…
 What’re…those movements…?
 As you know, in that technique…
 one gets stronger the more one drinksand the more one gets drunk.
 I know…
 At the restaurant before…
 When Lee mistook it for waterand drank a small cup of alcohol…
 It took Neji and me, the both of us,to finally…be able to overpower Lee.
 You couldn’t restrain him yourself…?
 I could overpower himif I was fighting him as an enemy…
 But well, I couldn’t inflict a serious injuryon my beloved student…
 That’s right…
 That’s how it wasjust with one small cup, so…
 If he were to drinkan entire bottle of alcohol…
 An invincible strength, huh…?
 But it’s just afterhe got out of the hospital.
 How long will his bodyhold on for…?
 A Loopy Fist User, huh…?lt’s my first time seeing one…
 If you’re not going to come…then I’ll go!
 His attacks are straight as usual…
 Oh!
 Ouch!
 It’s your fault!
 I…I…!
 I’m enjoying my youth!
 He’s too unorthodox…
 And most of all…he’s fast!
 Right in the middle of my youth…
 Dance of the Camellia!
 Here!
 I can’t read his movements…
 An attack on me…That’s quite some Taijutsu…
 I have no choice…
 My attack ability is bones…
 You heard that earlierfrom the Clone brat, right…?
 I’ll sober you up right away.
 I’m…not drunk…or anything!
 Then I’ll wake you up!
 I’m not drunk or anything!
 In the first place, I’m a minor!
 Minors shouldn’t drink at all!
 Unorthodox, isn’t it…?This is my Kekkei Genkai.
 Calm down…Think of a strategy…
 Seek…some kind of possibility…
 Humph. With that wound…
 It seems he wasn’t ableto escape very far at all…
 This is my limit…I can’t move…
 Damn it…He’s already caught up?
 And…
 My head’s pounding…
 And what’s with this wound…?
 It seems I was drunk, eh…?
 Your appearance…!
 It seems you’ve sobered up…This is my Kekkei Genkai…
 Kekkei Genkai…
 My Kekkei Genkai freely controlsosteoblastic and osteoclastic cells…
 It even controls the concentrationof calcium. It's an ability to form bones.
 Basically, there are over two hundredbones in the human body…
 But for me, that’s not a set number.
 But bones are bones, after all!
 If they break, they break!
 Wh-What a hardness…!
 Are these really human bones…?!
 If so…!
 Larch Dance.
 I’ve had it…
 A little more…you clod.
 It’s not like the time before with Asuma…
 A-Asuma!
 There’s probably zero possibilityof someone coming to help...
 Hey, what’s the point of thinkingabout someone helping…?!
 Calm down!
 The smell is moving away…
 I’m saved…
 Who is?
 How…?!
 I knew it…
 My coat?!
 It seems you didn’t notice your own smellthat you’re routinely used to smelling…
 With that you erased your own smell?
 You understand well the attributes of scent.lt figures why I didn’t smell you.
 And…as would be expected,
 it’s tough having you guys split up in twoto search for me…
 Damn it…
 Please wait!
 The real deal…is from now!
 My role now is to stall this personas long as possible…
 So, I should’ve avoided a big techniquethat could be self-defeating…
 But it seems this isn’t an opponenteasy enough to be able to beat
 without using my Secret Technique…
 Here I go!
 I just had surgeryand am not at my best.
 But if it’d just be opening the first of theEight Inner Gates, The Gate of Opening,
 I should somehow…
 The first gate… Gate of Opening…
 Open!
 Primary Lotus!
 The impact of the kickwas suppressed by the bones…?!
 That’s some speed… But it’s over.
 Damn it… No matter how much I think,I can’t come up with any good strategies!
 I’ve had it…can’t hold any further…
 With me right in front of you,you can’t even howl like a loser…?
 Eh?!
 Die!
 You’re mine!
 Don’t you be smilingbefore you’re going to die!
 What?!
 Who’re you?!
 Heh… It seemsyou’re an ally this time…
 Who’re you?!
 A Sand…
 Shinobi…
 ally of the Leaf!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 I heard that the Sand and Leafhad made up, but…
 It wasn’t that we attacked the Leaf Villagefor the fun of it.
 It was just a mission, same as this time.
 Humph! I see.
 By the way, weren’t you threeheaded this way together?
 We had no choice.Since you guys are weak…
 Idiot. Don’t take them lightly.These guys are out of the ordinary.

 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears

 Sasuke!
 Are you going torun away from me?!
 Yo…loser.
 A Cry on Deaf Ears
 It’s you this time, huh?
 I couldn’t do it.I was not able to stop Sasuke…
 I think…the one who can stop Sasuke…
 the one who can save Sasuke is…
 Naruto…you are the only one.
 Naruto…this is my…once in a lifetime…favor to ask…
 Please… Please bring Sasuke back!
 I also told this to Sakura, but…
 Don’t mind me anymore.
 What's with that face?
 Iruka Sensei, why on the earthdoes an outstanding person like me
 have to be on the same team with him?
 Sasuke graduated withthe highest grade out of all students…
 Naruto, you are at the bottom!
 When you even outthe team’s strength,
 then it naturally becomes like this.
 Try your best not to slow me down,you dunce.
 I am fine without eating!I am absolutely fine.
 I’m…fine…
 Here.
 You asked Sakura for a hint the other day,what did she tell you?
 Shall we go?
 Yup.
 Wh-What’s with that face…?
 You loser…
 Why…?
 You… I hated you, you know.
 It’s none of your business!
 Who knows,my body moved on its own.
 You rescue Sakura, no matter what!
 Sasuke… You…
 I could still distract him for a little while…
 I lost everything once.
 I don’t want to see my precious comradesdie in front of me anymore.
 Why…?
 Why is it…Sasuke?
 Why did you become like this?!
 You!
 Whatever happens to me,what does that have to do with you?
 I have my own way.
 No matter who it is,
 nobody has the rightto tell me what to do.
 I will tell you the truth.
 I’m done fooling around withyou guys of the Leaf.
 Go home.
 I’ll take care of him!
 Choji…
 Go everyone!
 Go, quickly! I’ll catch up with you.
 Neji…
 Okay!
 Hold on!
 Kiba…
 Kiba! Akamaru!
 Now! Naruto!
 Shikamaru…
 The strategy…a success!
 What are you doing?Please go quickly!
 You also promised Sakurawith a Nice-Guy pose, Naruto.
 Bushy Brow…
 I’ll defeat this person.
 It’s a promise.
 Everyone…
 Everyone risked their livesto come after you, you know!
 Good job for them.
 Lastly, I will tell youthe most important thing.
 Sasuke is neither a close friendof mine nor is he someone I like.
 But Sasuke is a Shinobi ofthe Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 A comrade.
 That’s why we will rescue himby risking our lives.
 This is the Leaf way.
 How do you takeyour comrades of the Leaf ?!
 Comrades, you said…
 Did I become stronger stayingwith those so-called comrades?
 I am going to where Orochimaru is.
 Orochimaru is the person who killedthe Third Hokage
 and tried to crush The Leaf Village!
 Do you think he willgive you the power freely?
 He just wants your bodyas a vessel!
 You might not be able to come back.You might get killed.
 You think I’d easily let yougo to such a place?!
 That doesn’t matter to me…
 If my goal is accomplished,then that’s all that matters.
 If you intend to get in that way…
 Then it can’t be helped…
 You’re not gonna be able to!I’ll take you back even by force!
 Why are you laughing?!
 You were laughing at that time too.
 That time…?
 What’s funny?
 It’s not funny. I am happy.
 Thinking about…how I can finally defeat you here.
 That time you wanted to fight me, right?
 You were thrilled weren’t you?
 At first!
 But, you were different.
 That was…
 Hurry up and come.
 But first, put on your Headband.I’ll wait.
 I don’t need such a thing…
 Just put it on!
 You won’t be able toput one scratch on my face.
 That’s not it!
 I’m saying that this is a signthat we fight as equal Leaf Shinobi.
 That is what I call a stuck up!
 You think you and I are equal?
 Yeah, I think so.
 I’ve never thought I was inferior to you.
 You’re so obnoxious!
 Stop!
 That was…
 That was not the kind of fight I wanted.
 Even now…this is not…
 I don’t care aboutyour circumstances.
 What…is this power?
 Power is flowing out…
 So this is the power thatthe guy was talking about.
 Furthermore, the poweris growing into my body.
 If it is like that now…if I release this curse mark…
 I wonder how much power…
 Wh-What power…
 He’s not the same as before…
 Wake up already!
 I awakened long ago…
 From my idiotic self who dreams abouta lax peaceful future…
 hanging out with comrades.
 That’s why I left the village!
 That’s why I sought power!
 My dream is not in the future.
 My dream is in the past…
 That’s the only place it exists.
 Wow, Brother!
 You hit the target right in the middle,even the one behind the rock!
 All right, me too!
 Sasuke, let’s go home.
 Geez… You said thatyou would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.
 There is an important mission tomorrowand I need to prepare for that.
 Liar…
 Forgive me, Sasuke…Another time.
 Brother, watch me!
 Hey! If you push yourself…
 Why is the one who twistedhis ankle laughing?
 Could it be that you are tryingto take the easy way?
 That’s not true...
 I’m happy thinking about
 how I’m finally going tothe Academy starting tomorrow.
 I’m going to do my bestwhen I enter the Academy.
 So even that father will approve of me.
 He will count on melike he does on my brother…
 Sasuke… You really are…
 I told you…
 I don’t need a futurewith you guys anymore.

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 It looks likethe preparations are complete.
 So this is the Land of Greensyou were talking about, brother?
 Well, it’s a small land,
 but it could be a good stepping-stonefor getting ahead in the world.
 We’ve already bought offhalf of the public officials.
 This land will be overturnedon our signal.
 As of today,we’re the feudal lords of this land.
 Feudal lords, huh…?
 That has a nice ring to it.
 Open for Business!The Leaf Moving Service
 This is a problem…
 I thought about testing outvarious combinations, but it backfired.
 With these remaining members,there’s nobody who can take the lead…
 But it’s merchant protection this time,
 so no matter who goes,there probably isn’t much to worry about.
 Mission difficulty isn’t the issue.
 It’s a commission fromthe Land of Greens.
 I wanted to send thema respectable team.
 The lord of the castle therewas good to me in the old days!
 True indeed…
 He generously assumed the debtsfor the bundle you blew on gambling.
 It’s small,but it’s a nice and easygoing land.
 There was an adorable princess,and two boy Ninja looked after her…
 At that time,they both said they’d marry me…
 I wonder if they still feel that way…
 I don’t think so.
 I bet they’ve all gotten big…
 We’ll be at the border soon.
 This is our last look at this sceneryfor a while.
 All right!A mission, a mission!
 Wait up, Naruto!
 Everyone else was off on missions,
 but I've been doing nothing butodd jobs in the village!
 I was sick of hearing storiesabout everyone’s adventures.
 Still,we’re guarding merchants this time.
 It ‘s probably not somethingto brag about.
 Then I should exaggeratethe story a bit
 and say that I took outabout a thousand bandits, right?
 That’s just lying…
 Oh! There they are.That’s them!
 Yahoo!
 Who’re you?
 You guys are merchantsfrom the Land of Greens, right?
 That’s right.
 We’ve come fromthe Village Hidden in Leaves
 to protect you guys.Believe it.
 The Village Hidden in Leaves?
 See…? 					This, this.
 We were told to protect youfrom mountain bandits…
 It’s for certain.
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki.
 And this is Hinata.
 I’m Choji Akimichi.
 Um, we received one more itemfrom the Hokage
 to identify ourselves with.
 Hey, Momiji.
 Give it back.
 Oh, it’s true.
 These people are fromthe Village of the Hidden Leaf.
 See…?74.01	01:30:15:10	01:30:17:11	The Leaf Moving Service
 Wh-What’s that?
 Old lady Tsunade…she’s done it this time!
 I see.
 I’m Kikusuke.
 This is Yurinoshin.
 He’s Shun.
 I’m Momiji!We’ll be counting on you movers!
 You sure eat a lot.
 That’s why you're so f…
 Fa?!
 …full figured.
 For you.
 I love people with great strength.
 Something like this is a cinch.
 See? Watch.
 Roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll…
 Somebody help me!
 That Choji, getting all carried away.
 Move faster, mover.
 We’re rapidly falling behind.
 We’re not movers, I’m telling you.
 Why don’t you help outbefore complaining?!
 No, it’s fine.
 Our cousin Shun is in poor health.
 You don’t need to worry,Kikusuke, Yurinoshin.
 I had no intention oflistening to anything
 this good-for-nothing has had to sayfrom the start.
 Who’s a good-for-nothing?!Just you watch!
 Honestly,it’s because you push yourself too far…
 I’m sorry…Shun’s being unreasonable.
 Water! 					Oh.
 Mine’s empty, too.
 Then there’s some fresh drawn water.
 Here!
 Wow,how’d you find water in a place like this?
 My grandma taught me.
 Your grandma?
 It's this…
 You can tell with this.
 What?! 					With those?
 It’s called dousing.
 If you concentrateon the item you’re looking for…
 these rods will react to that itemand will inform you when you're near it.
 It’s knowledge passed onfrom our predecessors.
 When I get back to the village,
 maybe I'll try to find moneythat people dropped with that.
 Tasty!
 It doesn’t compare to the waterin the Land of Greens, but it's good water.
 Come to think of it,what kind of place is the Land of Greens?
 The Land of Greens is…a small land deep in the mountains.
 Everyone in the land loves natureand is warm-hearted.
 It was indeed Shangri-La…
 Was…?
 Oh, it’s nothing…
 But, you know, if it’s such a great place,why do you need protection?
 It’s targeted becausethe people take peace for granted!
 What do you mean by that?
 Stuff like loving natureand being warm-hearted sounds nice.
 But the bottom line is that the peoplein the Land of Greens are all softhearted.
 We live in a troubled time now.
 Something like believing in peopleis ridiculous.
 Hey, the Land of Greensis not something to speak ill of like that.
 The lord of the castle there was kindeven to us merchants passing through.
 To think he’d take up that kind of attitudewith an old lady…
 He’s kind of disagreeable.
 He’s your cousin, right?Do something about him.
 R-Right.
 He’s probably a bit touchyfrom the bad things that have happened.
 I’m sorry…
 Oh, i-it’s okay…
 Hey, that’s dangerous.
 It’s dangerousto wander around alone.
 Brother Choji, look at that…
 Naruto!
 What is it?
 That.
 Wh-What is that?
 That’s in the direction ofthe Land of Greens, right?!
 I’m going to go check it out…You take the others and go on ahead.
 I’ll be right back.
 Listen.
 What we saw here is a secret.
 We don’t want everyone to get worried.
 Yeah. 					Got it.
 Huh? Where’s Naruto?
 Th-The bathroom…
 I’ll give this to youif you tell me what you saw earlier.
 Black smoke… 					was rising.
 Black smoke…?! 					From where?
 The direction of the Land of Greens.
 Lord Shun…
 It’s finally…
 I should be at the Land of Greensborder pretty soon.
 Wh-What was that …?There was no presence at all.
 Who’re you guys!
 Who’re you guys?
 That headband. You’re withthe Hidden Leaf Village, right?
 So what if I am?Why are you targeting me?
 I have no intentionof fighting you guys.
 It seems the ones we are looking forare heading this direction, you see.
 Those who prowl around here will die.
 Did we do it…?
 The Substitution Jutsu?!
 The real one is over here!
 These guys are pretty good.
 Two left.
 One of them is the real one!
 What?!
 Too bad!Those two are also clones.
 I’m going to turn back for now…
 Choji! Hinata!
 How’d it go, Naruto?
 Actually, there’s trouble…
 Guys! Let’s take a break herefor the time being!
 Pursuers from the Land of Greens?
 They said that…
 The ones they were looking forwere headed in this direction.
 But why would Ninjabe after this group?
 These people are just merchants,aren’t they?
 And they’re not even peoplefrom the Land of Greens to begin with…
 Now that you mention it,that’s right.
 But what will we do?
 We’re going to engage them if they come,of course.
 That might be impossible…
 We have elderly peopleand children with us.
 You’re right…
 I know.
 It could be thatthey’re not chasing after us!
 What do you mean by that?
 Basically, we’re movingin the same direction as their true target
 and we could just bein their battle ground…or something.
 I see.
 That means if we clear the path,they’ll let us go right by.
 Alright.
 Listen up, guys!
 Some kind of troublesome guysare heading this way.
 Troublesome guys?
 Naruto, I think everyone will feel anxiousif you say it like that.
 I-I see…
 But you don’t need to worry.
 They’re probably not after us…
 It’ll kind of be the long way around,
 but we’ll make it throughif we take a little side turn up ahead.
 Does this feudal lord really have this little?
 He’s a feudal lordwho’s a prestigious ruler of virtue.
 So he would never line his pockets.
 But we’ll squeeze out a big pilefrom now on.
 More importantly, hasthe young girl in question been found?
 Nope…
 But the two who were tracking hergot attacked.
 We know the direction she fled in.
 That young girl just would not be good.
 If they get away, they may returnwith forces from other lands.
 If the sun were a little stronger,
 I could burned down a whole mountainwith my Jutsu…
 Then I’ll go…
 Lord Renga, I gathered all collaboratorsin the hall as you ordered…
 Oh, good work.
 Without your guys’ help, we couldn’t havebrought down the castle this easily …
 Then brother,shall we go for the hall greeting?
 Okay… I’ll take care of things here.
 So, about the thing you promised…
 Oh, that’s right.
 Take as much there as you like.
 Really?
 Honestly. It’s so easy to deceivesofthearted people…
 It really is exactly so.
 Our lord believed in usuntil the very end…
 Come on.
 If you stuff that much in there,the ferry on death’s river will sink.
 I make it a habit not to believe in people.
 Especially peoplewho have betrayed someone once…
 Y-You’re joking, Lord Renga…
 It’s no joke.
 C-Could it be that you had megather the collaborators in the coup to…
 You’re also softhearted!
 That should do it.
 Yurinojou, it seems they’re after us.
 Yes.
 I leave Lady Haruna to you.
 What are you going to do?
 If we wait here for their attack,there will be too many to defend.
 Since it’s come to this,I’ll slow them down.
 But according to the information,
 they are three Janinwho use unknown Jutsu.
 I know.
 But my Jutsu will not be defeatedby the likes of them.
 Very well.
 Go, Kikunojou.
 Yes, Lady Haruna.
 Naruto.
 I set a trap for the time being.
 Jeez, Hinata.You’re such a worrywart.
 You don’t need to go that far.
 Huh? Yurinoshin,where’s Kikusuke?
 You’re right. 					Since when…?
 Oh, he had some other businessand went on ahead…
 Say what? Taking liberties like thatis really a problem…
 Oh, I see.
 So that’s it, huh?
 What is it?
 Even Kikusuke makes sureto go to the bathroom.
 Naruto…!
 Lady Haruna, I shall protect you with my life!
 There!
 Who’re you…?!
 I’m Ruiga.
 To think you’djust come right on out nonchalantly.
 Then she must in that group, right?
 If it’s one against one,I won’t lose to a hired Ninja like you!
 Can you do it?
 Have a taste ofthe Land of Greens’ Flower Ninja Art!
 Eat this! Flower Shuriken!Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage!
 Too easy…
 I don’t know about that!

 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 A running-ramen strategy, huh?
 In other words, we split upin order to avoid annihilation, right?
 With this,the protection burden will decrease.
 But won’t the soup spill if it runs?
 This is an example.
 It’d still be troubleeven if it’s just an example, believe it.
 Then, let’s make itthe running-ramen-with-a-lid strategy.
 If you say so, Naruto.
 I mean, do you really understandthe strategy, Naruto?

 But it seems we fooled him good.
 Our Disguise Jutsu is perfect,sure enough.
 Say, infiltration is kind of easy, isn’t it?!
 The Leaf isn’t worth fearing!
 Guy and Lee imposters areprowling around the village?
 And to think they’d enter the villagein disguises
 without even using Transformation Jutsu.
 Are they really Ninja?
 Weird people find their wayin when a village grows.
 Well, it’s nonsense, but I thoughtI would at least report it for now.
 Indeed, we can’t just leaveintruders unchecked.
 Shall we throw them out?
 No, leave them be.
 What?
 It sounds interesting, doesn’t it?
 They’re going to the trouble ofcalling themselves Ninja of this village.
 But…
 We probably don’t need to worry.
 It’s unlikely that anyone could befooled by such obvious imposters.
 Come on, please.Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!
 Pretty please with sugar on top!Just the one day today would be fine!
 Let me join your training!
 Hey! What’s with this guy all of a sudden?
 He’s probably a real acquaintanceof theirs, but…
 Does he thinkwe’re going to do training?!
 I’ll do anything! I’ve alwaysbeen interested in Taijutsu.
 I mean…okay?! It’s okay, right?
 Anyway, let’s turn him away!
 Right!
 No. Take a pass.
 What? Why?!
 Because our training is very harsh, rough and difficult.
 Difficult training, huh…?
 Ahhh, I’m getting evenmore fired up! Please!
 I won’t get in your way,no matter what! Come on.
 – Absolutely not!– Absolutely not!
 All right, since it’s come to this!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Real body clones?!
 – And furthermore…– And furthermore…
 – Harem Jutsu!– Harem Jutsu!
 Wh-What?!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 – Pl-ea-se. 					– Pl-ea-se.
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 What?!
 Yes!
 – No way. 					– No way.
 Brother, why’d you say okay?
 What’s done is done,so it can’t be helped, right?!
 Hey, Guy Sensei, Lee!
 What’s the deal, you two?
 We’re going to the farm today, right?
 Farm?
 What’re you doing lettingyour mind wander?
 The person’s waiting.Come on, hurry!
 – Huh? Oh… 					– H-Hey!
 Hey, wait!
 – What…? 					– Huh?
 I promised to plant rice forthe sake of training?
 Not only that, all of this…
 It’s totally huge.
 Gee, thanks. It’s a big help,you guys giving me a hand.
 Please don’t worry about it.
 They accepted this ontheir own accord, so. Bye.
 Why is this training?
 I get it!
 Indeed, I will use my body quitea bit if I do this training.
 So I can get in shapewhile helping out, huh?
 Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!
 I’ll do my best!
 Why’s he that motivated?
 Why should we haveto do this manual labor…?
 Damn it.Anyway, let’s get this over with!
 You’re right.
 Th-That’s mean, brother!
 Oh, sorry about that.
 What?
 Poccha?!
 Come to think of it, there areflying leeches  in the rice fields,
 so be careful.
 F-Flying leeches?!
 Worst-case scenario, it could be deadly.
 Yikes.
 Hey Poccha!
 Hang in there!
 Just what I’d expect of Taijutsu training!
 That was some intense rice planting!
 Phew, that was a good workout!
 W-We’re done…
 Th-That was life or death…
 Then, shall we move on?
 – A manure receptacle?!– A manure receptacle?!
 Spread this in that field over there.
 Th-This is also training…?
 H-Heavy…Smelly…
 Why should I have to dosomething like this…?
 Hey, you guys,why don’t you walk straight?
 Y-You can walk twicethe forward progress distance
 if you move ahead while walking left and right like this!
 Oh, so that was it?
 Then I’ll also…
 Like this?
 I-It’s really hard to balance like this!
 D-Damn it!
 Gee, I didn’t realize at all thatthere was a method of training like this…
 Hey! Watch it.Walk more over there…
 What’d you say?
 What a nightmare.
 Forget about it.Anyway, let’s lose the kid right now.
 As for you guys,you still kind of smell bad.
 – Shut up! 					– Shut up!
 There you are, Guy Sensei, Lee.
 Oh, Sakura.
 Oh, Naruto. You’re here, too?
 As for me,I’m training together with these two today.
 R-Really?
 More importantly, is something up?
 Yeah… Actually, I really wantedyour help with something, Guy Sensei, Lee.
 – What? 					– What?
 – Your laundry blew away in the wind?– Your laundry blew away in the wind?
 That’s right.lt got caught in a bit of a high spot.
 No. No way, no way.We’ve got lots of work to do, so.
 Come on!
 Here I’m asking preciselybecause it’s you guys.
 Please don’t say no!
 Sakura, if you’re in that much trouble,I could get it for you!
 Okay, Guy Sensei?
 Okay?!
 Sure.
 What a sheer cliff.
 That’s for sure. We’d be beyond helpif we were to fall from up there.
 Right? I don’t quite have the confidence…
 That means…
 Yup! It’s right above here.
 Gee, as one would expect,I don’t think we could…
 Isn’t that great, Sakura?
 For Guy Sensei, a cliff like this isno different than a flat path.
 That’s encouraging.
 It’s a big help having an awesome Ninjalike you close by, Guy Sensei.
 What? Uhh… Umm…
 Now, please.
 Brother…
 Damn it. Why is this happening?!
 I-I don’t want to die.
 D-Damn it!
 Hey, as for you guys,why aren’t you using the Chakra suction?
 Th-This is training for building upmuscular strength!
 So that’s what it was?!
 Just what I’d expect of a Taijutsu user.
 I never came up with deliberatelydraining physical strength!
 I really do learn a lot frombeing with you, Sensei.
 Th-This jerk…
 I’m…I’m going to die…
 Alley-oop!
 No!
 Th-That was close…!
 Gee, sorry about that.
 This jerk…
 All right, we made it.
 Don’t look down!
 Anyway, if we can just takethis back with us…
 Alley-oop…
 Damn it…
 All right, I got it.
 It won’t come loose…Hey, help me out here.
 R-Right…
 You little…!
 Sensei, use suction with your Chakra!
 This is nothing to me!
 Look out!
 For real? What?!
 Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!
 I’ve had it…
 Sensei, Bushy Brow!
 That was awesome!
 To do something like notusing Chakra suction. Awesome!
 – Look you…! 					– Look you…!
 Perfect timing, you guys.
 Old Lady Tsunade.
 Actually, I’ve got somethingI want to ask you guys to do.
 My companion suddenly startednot feeling well, you see.
 – Yikes! It’s huge!– It's huge!
 It seems she’s caught a cold.
 It’s a huge slug. Oh, as for this,is it something like Chief Toad?
 Well, that sounds about right.
 However, as you can see,we can’t carelessly move her.
 Sorry, but could you guys lookafter her for a while?
 I’m very sorry.
 Jeez. What a ridiculous guy.
 Brother, at this rate we won’t be able to look for the confidential information.
 Oh, that’s right.
 Shut up.
 What’re you moaning about?
 You guys.
 It couldn’t be that you guys
 can’t listen to the words of me,the Hokage, could it?
 – This is the Hokage?– This is the Hokage?
 This is bad. To think the Hokagewas that fierce a person.
 We’re taking care ofher precious companion.
 We might be able to get intothe Hokage estate surprisingly easily.
 I wonder.
 So even Summoning animalsget sick, too…
 It seems to be a light cold.
 My nose itches, I have a sore throatand I feel weak or something…
 Hey, I’m going to chill your forehead!
 Thank you so much.
 All right, here we go.
 Oh…Oh no. The itching…
 What?!
 – Wha--! 					– What?!
 It’s… It’s melting…
 Watch it, you!
 I’m very sorry. I’ll be more caref--
 Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!
 You’ll be in danger if you don’tmove away from there!
 My…My lower back…
 Y-You idiot!
 I’m developing my dynamic vision for narrowly evading danger!
 Wha--?
 That Sensei,
 he was training, putting his lifeat risk even at times like this…?
 Even though that Bushy Brow guy’s training properly, as for me…!
 I’ve woken up,Guy Sensei, I’ll train with you!
 Let’s do this!
 Ohh, the joints in my body hurt…I feel like I’m going to fall apart…
 Hey! Aren't you a slug?What’re you doing talking about joints?!
 – S-Save us. 					– S-Save us!
 I’ve had it.What’s going on with this village…?
 I’ll die if I stay in a place like thisany longer.
 Withdraw…
 Right.
 Who’re you guys?
 Why are you dressed likemy protégé Lee…?
 Damn it!
 Since it’s come to this, I don’t give a damn anymore!
 – Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!– Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!
 I don’t really get it, but it seems we just have to fight, huh?
 So it seems.
 Let’s go, Lee!
 Now, knockout technique!
 – Double Dynamic Entry!– Double Dynamic Entry!
 Damn it. What did we go there for in the end?!
 I really hate, I really hate…
 – the likes of the Leaf!– the likes of the Leaf!
 Tamaya!
 Lord knows where they came from,
 but now they’ll probably never want to try that again.
 You sure looked likeyou were having fun, Lady Tsunade,
 going so far as to summon Katsuyu.
 Well, my adorable Geninhelped out as well, so.
 Now, we’ve had our breather.So please be getting back to work.
 Oh yes, ma’am.
 But still…What was with that Naruto?
 To think he seriously believedthose two were for real.
 What was that all about?
 Who knows…?
 Hey!
 Naruto.
 – Someone who looked just like me now…– Man, you guys got separated.
 I didn’t know what to do.
 As for me, I was impressed!
 – You guys were really cool earlier!– Huh?
 I’ve learned of the intricacies of Taijutsuor something…
 A lot happened, but I’ll continuetraining right away!
 Continue training?
 So come on, let’s continuethe Taijutsu training!
 Moron, moron, moron.
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Damn it! Why should a Ninja haveto do something like get rid of a ghost?!
 We have no choice, right?After all, a commission is a comission!
 The ghost of a feudal lord, my butt?!Th-That’s ridiculous!
 But they say it comes out at night!
 A ghost warrior clad in a white armor!
 N-No, I’m not afraid of it at all!
 H-Hey! Behind you!
 No!
 I knew it! You ARE afraid!

 A Past to Be Erased
 That mark…
 I saw the same one on the guys that attacked this village!
 That’s a lie!
 It’s not a lie! This mark…
 Same from that night…
 N-No! Spare me!
 Stop!
 This is the same mark fromthat time.
 No way!
 But this wasn’t inthe medical team’s report.
 Byakugan!
 It seems this is a particular markthat only emerges
 when he sweats…
 You guys get out!
 Why?
 I’m going to take care of him.
 Say what?! I won’t let you do that!
 Why do you protect him?ls the Leaf Village also in cahoots?
 No, that’s not it!
 He doesn’t remembera thing from the past…
 He has no memory.
 No memory?
 It’s memory loss.We came in search of his memory.
 Then you should know now.He’s a dirty bandit!
 Whether or not he has a memorymakes no difference to me!
 Calm down!
 It would only be in vain to kill someone
 who has no memory of committing a crime.
 Shut up!
 If you really want to haveyour revenge,
 do so as much as you likeafter getting his memory back…
 I won’t stop you at that time.
 I won’t let you do that even ifhe gets his memory back!
 It’s as Neji says.
 We’ll also find out the identityof the guys who attacked
 if his memory returnsand we get him to talk.
 We might be able to save the villageif we can use him to cut a deal…
 We have to keep him alive now.We won’t run away or hide!
 Keep quiet… He won’t let Menma liveunless we tell him this.
 I’m going to sew up the wound.Hold his arms and legs.
 That girl is…
 I just can’t believe it.He’s the embodiment of good nature…
 To think he’d be a comradeof the bandits.
 I wonder if he became a good guy after losing his memory.
 He just has the same mark as those guysdue to some sort of circumstance.
 Even if he lost his memory,
 he wouldn’t become this good-naturedof a guy if he was a bad person.
 Either way, we’ll know everything if he get his memory back.
 I was…a comrade of the bandits,wasn’t I?
 You heard us talking earlier?
 Don’t worry about it.We don’t know any of the details. Okay?
 Heal that wound for now…
 I’m going to havea look around the area.
 You understand, right?
 Your friends and that guy will die if you try anything funny.
 Do as you like when that happens.
 It’s done…
 Fuki…
 You heard, didn’t you?
 I can’t stand it, after all!
 Let’s get him. Let’s avenge everyone!
 Stop!
 It’s still not certain thatMenma’s one of their comrades!
 You’re just as much to blameif you protect him!
 – Right! 					– Right!
 What’s the ruckus?!
 Naruto?
 Tenten…!
 Why did you let him out of the hut?!
 Sorry. I dozed off…
 I got careless thinking he couldn’t move…
 Guys, stop! He has no memory!
 So he doesn’t even know if he’s one of their comrades or not…!
 We warned you before!
 You guys are just as much to blameif you protect him any further!
 Get them!
 Stop it!
 We should get away for now!
 I’m…fine…
 What?
 Of course, everyone’s angry.I…should be punished.
 You’ll be killed!
 That’s fine!
 What’re you saying, Menma?!
 Byakugan!
 It’s them!
 The bridge! Raise the bridge!
 Right!
 Got it!
 Be careful of the Leaf Ninja andsecure an entrance route!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Now’s our chance.Everyone hide!
 You, too!
 We can take care of this ourselves!
 Come on, Fuki!
 They’ve come from two spots!
 Where’d they go?!
 They vanished.
 Be quiet!
 The wind…
 I get it.
 They’ve trapped us in a Genjutsu
 with a different tone mixed inwith the sound of the wind!
 Be careful!We’re now inside their Jutsu!
 You noticed too late!
 M-My body…
 It’s heavy…
 This is bad… Is it Paralysis?!
 Canceling Sound!
 The Paralysis is released.
 You backstabber!
 Here they come!
 I’ll leave those guys to you!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 It’s futile!
 Heh, what’s the matter?Finished already?!
 I don’t even have a scratch on me…
 This is what I was after!
 Wha--?!
 What’s happening?I’m getting an amazing power.
 Here I go!
 Rotation!
 Now, prepare yourself!
 You won’t get away!
 Here…
 This is precious to you, right?
 Behind you!
 You jerk!
 Your voice… It’s back!
 Th-Thank you…
 Now, let’s go back to the others.
 Right.
 Menma! You okay?
 Yeah…
 We took care of most of them!
 What about their leader?What about Shiin?!
 I chased after him, but he got away…
 This is bad…
 Now that Shiin knows the villagerswon’t abandon their homes and get out,
 he’ll use his last resort.
 There is a dam built upriver to securewater resources during a drought.
 There is enough water for the village to last a year, even if it doesn’t rain.
 The dam has been rigged to blow up
 and to sweep awaythe entire village with a flood.
 All they care aboutis the mine.
 We can’t stop something like a flood
 unless we move mountainsor something!
 Mountains…
 That’s it.We should move mountains!
 Naruto! Take me to the mine.
 Wha--?
 There should be a bunch ofLetter Bombs in the mine!
 Letter Bombs?!What’re you going to do with those?!
 I’m going to blow up the mine itself.
 The crumbled dirt and sand will fill up the valley
 and the flood can be stopped.
 Damn it! He’s started!Let’s hurry, Menma!
 Naruto… There’s something I have to tell you.
 Make it later!
 I haven’t lost my memory.
 Yeah… But stoppingthe flood comes first!
 No, I’d like you to listen now.
 I lost my parents when I was littleand was raised in Shiin’s clan.
 They were a small Shinobi clan evenin the Land of Rice Paddies.
 But they still had ambitious plans…
 However, a Shinobi village was created in the Land of Rice Paddies
 about a year ago.
 It was the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 The Village Hidden in the Sound!
 Clan members confident in their skill
 drifted over to Hidden Sound Village one after another.
 Eventually jobs fromthe feudal lord stopped coming.
 Shiin the leader of the clan thathad lost its means of livelihood
 set his eyes on the mine in this village…
 The plan was to just threatenand chase off the villagers.
 But I encounteredunexpected resistance,
 and I got scared and tried to escape…
 What’re you hesitating for? Hurry up and take care of him.
 Father! Father!
 Stop it!
 You… You jerk!
 Look out!
 I’m a member of a clan thathas committed crimes.
 It would’ve been better ifI’d just died like that…
 How easy things would’ve been if I could’ve died then…
 I got scared thinking about the villagers who died…
 I wanted to forget.
 And so I cowardly escaped intoa Jutsu passed down through the clan
 that erases memory.
 However, the Jutsu didn’t work very well…
 I only temporarily lost my memoryand it came back in a few hours.
 Then you had your memory the whole time?!
 I’m sorry…
 Knock it off!
 Then why didn’t you tell me aboutthat honestly from the start?!
 If you had, it would’ve been…
 I didn’t have the courage to makethe crimes of the clan public.
 But I thought the clan mustnot commit any further crimes.
 So I pretended to losemy memory.
 And to prevent the clan fromadding to their crimes…
 I wanted to bring some of you Leaf Shinobi here
 and have you help out.
 I knew of Shiin’s next plan.
 There must not be any more village casualties.
 Stopping that is my dutyfor having survived.
 Duty…?
 I needed the helpof the Leaf Shinobi
 before Shiin couldexecute his next plan…
 I wanted to round them all up during the attack earlier.
 But since things have come this far,I’ll stop the flood.
 Thanks, Naruto…
 I leave Shiin to you.Find and stop him, no matter what.
 You… This…?
 This is goodbye.
 Somebody has to blow upthe Letter Bombs inside…
 If you do that, you’ll…!
 Thanks to you, my life has taken on more meaning…
 What’s that sound?
 There are intermittent explosionsoccurring upriver…
 The village will be engulfed ina mudslide if the dam breaks!
 No…!
 Neji…
 It’s coming!
 Goodbye…
 Naruto…
 Menma!
 Wh-What happened…?
 It seems the crumbled mountain stopped the mudslide…
 Then, that means the village is saved?
 Yeah…
 – Thank goodness!– That’s a relief…
 H-How can that be?!
 Menma!!
 That jerk…!
 He won’t get away!Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hold it!
 Interfering with our plan!
 You think such a Jutsu will work on me… Huh?!
 Die!
 I’ll stop you in Menma’s place!
 What?!
 Rasengan!
 He sacrificed his life to save the village, huh…?
 No matter what his past was,he was a good guy at heart…
 Mister…
 I wanted to say a word of apology.
 Not being able to rememberanything until the end
 might have been salvation for him…
 It was a promise, right?To eat this with you.
 You don’t needto say anything to him?
 He’ll be fine if he has an appetite.I know how he is.
 He’ll overcome it on his ownas time passes.
 For a while he’ll probably remembereach time he eats ramen…
 That’s fine.
 People can get strongerprecisely because
 they have feelingsthat are never forgotten…
 That’s what’s called growth.
 Damn… This is good!
 Menma…
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by

 It's early afternoon now…
 Let's have a meal.
 You two rest a bit andI'll go find us something to eat.
 Say…
 Hmm?
 As I recall, on the other one…
 ""Heaven"" was written here…
 and unlike this,both edges of the scroll were whitish, right?
 Umm, when I was shownthe scroll before the exam,
 I wasn't really looking.
 So, what of it all of a sudden?
 Y-You've got to be kidding…?
 For all we know…
 there may not be any Heaven scrolls.
 What do you mean, Sakura?
 Well, in this second exam…
 four of the five-daytime limit have passed already.
 So that means we've alreadyused eighty percent of the total exam time.
 Seventy-eight participantsand twenty-six teams.
 There are only thirteen eachof the Heaven and Earth scrolls.
 At most there are onlythirteen passing teams.
 Moreover, you remember,don’t you, Sasuke?
 That the Orochimaru guy burned the “Heaven scroll” that we had.
 Which means…
 The teams that will pass had already,at that point, decreased by one.
 Hmm?
 Also, all of the other scrolls arenot necessarily safe, so…
 After parting ways withthe Leaf Village bunch,
 we allotted two days for healing…
 So from here on, we have to increasethe distance of our actions.
 At any rate,the next enemy is our last chance.
 I'm going to get some drinking water.
 Say! Say!
 I have a good way for us not to fightwith an enemy. Believe it!
 What?!
 Get serious!
 I am serious.
 I have lots of scrolls stocked, so.
 Ninjutsu manual, deadly poison manual,for notes….
 If we tweak this a little and change itinto exactly like the Heaven scroll…
 H-Hold it!
 Huh?
 Even if you did such a thing,you don't know what's written on the inside!
 If the Proctor looked insideyou will be discovered right away!
 Idiot!
 Generally with things like this,
 there's a password orsomething written
 and you can’t get itunless you have both scrolls.
 In other words…
 to pass at the tower goal,we'll surely need a password.
 Or something like that.Believe it!
 What difference does it make?
 If you don't know the content,there's no use making a fake!
 Man, here I was wondering whatyou were going to say, looking all big…
 You're an idiot who just can'tthink through things.
 B-But…
 What if we could predict the content…?
 This Earth scroll…
 You wouldn't…
 I'm going to…open this scroll!
 No!
 You! Have you forgotteneven the rules, you idiot?
 We were told not to look inside the scrollsuntil arriving at the tower, right?
 But, at this rate,we’ll be in a hot spot, right?
 There might be a trap or something.
 Carefully… Be careful.
 Yeah.
 I know…
 Hey, what's wrong?
 Hey!
 What's wrong?
 What happened?!
 Hey!
 Hey! 					Answer me!
 You'd best not do it.
 An enemy?
 Man, you're beyond saving…
 That was close.
 W-We're sorry.
 Those who ignored the rules are forcedinto the situation of having to retire.
 In the previous exam, hypnotismJutsu Formula was set up to
 get into the eyes of those who lookedat the scroll along the way.
 A measure to get them to liein the forest until the end of the exam.
 By the way…
 If I'm not mistaken, you're Kabuto, right?
 What're you doing hangingaround here alone?
 It's not that I'm after your scroll.
 I didn't think so.
 If that was your intention…you could've taken it from Naruto just now.
 So you're also after the Heaven scroll?
 No.
 I already have them both.
 See?
 What?
 Things led to things…
 I was hurrying over tothe vicinity of the tower
 to wait for my estranged companions.
 Now, if you'll excuse me…
 Wait!
 Fight me.
 Lucky!
 Fight you, you say?
 S-Sasuke.
 This idiot-suke.
 What are you saying suddenly?
 Are you serious?
 Sorry, but we don't have anymore time.
 Hey, Sasuke!Kabuto saved us!
 Sasuke, I don't know about that, myself.
 Shut up!
 Sasu…ke.
 It can't be helped.I said it before, too.
 This is all that can be doneto survive through this forest now.
 Hmm…That's a lie.
 A lie?
 Your heart isn't totally in thisas much as you're saying.
 If you could really becomeserious about this exam…
 Why is it necessary to fight me?
 You should jump on meat my unguarded moment,
 without going tothe trouble of announcing it.
 That's…a Ninja.
 Hmm, that's profound.
 I don't dislike that side of you.
 So I shall tell you the way you should go.
 However…let's talk as we move.
 The smell of broiled fish in the fire smokehad reached a great distance.
 At this rate, we'll be markedby fierce animals…and enemies.
 Humph!
 Are there really still enemies around?
 Yes, no mistake.
 If you think about it a little,you'll understand.
 Do you know the cleverest wayof fighting in battles
 in jungles andexpansive forests such as this?
 No.
 The tower located in the centerof this forest,
 the common goal for us test-takers.
 That means when the last dayof the test is here…
 the area near that tower isthe easiest place to gather scrolls.
 Oh, I see. 					Ambush, right?
 In other words, we go after the scrollsof the teams
 that have both the Heaven and Earth scrollsand are setting out for the tower.
 That's one-third of the answer.
 What?
 I mean that you guys arenot the only ones thinking that!
 Near the tower, the same badgershave probably already set traps, so…
 I see!
 That means there are lots of enemieslying in wait to engage us.
 Heh, having a handicapgets me pumped, I say!
 I'm looking forward to it!
 If we just beat them all andget the Heaven scroll,
 we'll all survive the second exam!
 No! This is still two-thirds of the answer!
 What's the remainingone-third of the answer?
 The collectors who are certainto appear during an exam of this nature.
 Collectors?
 In this exam, with the towerjust a stone's throw away,
 you definitely can't rest easy…
 Those particular conditionsare what create them.
 In other words,those who gather extra scrolls…
 as compensation for sparing themwhen coming across an unexpected enemy.
 Also, those who get information toproceed favorably through later exams
 by providing the lacking scrolls tocomrades sharing the same village.
 And those who are thinking of,under conditions favorable to them,
 annihilating the powerful ones whowill probably get through to the third exam.
 It goes without saying,but these guys are quite the big guns
 and the worst enemies whoare definitely not conceited.
 I see.
 I understand the reasonwhy you appeared before us.
 You're scared, too, right?
 That's right.
 Now then, the tower has finallycome into view.
 From here on is the hard part.
 All right, let's go!
 An enemy already?
 There!
 Oh, it's just a centipede.
 Yikes! It's huge.
 All those legs are gross.
 Naruto.
 Huh?
 I'd like to avoid inadvertent sounds andcareless actions from here on.
 Huh?
 Rushing ahead through a dense forestmaking noise like an elephant
 is the same as serving noticein a loud voice that we're coming.
 We'd definitely receivean enthusiastic welcome.
 O-Oh, I see.
 As long as time allows, we shouldgo slowly while remaining hidden.
 – Yeah. 					– Okay.
 Sure.
 Heh, not bad, everyone.
 Oh?
 Okay, it's this way.
 Is it a trap?
 Yeah.  It'll get intense ahead from here on.
 Kabuto!
 H-Huh?
 That was close, Naruto.
 Substitution Jutsu!
 I told you, it would get intense aheadfrom here on.
 I've…had it…
 Oh! Sakura!
 For crying out loud,how far have we walked?
 The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer.
 Here we can see it rightin front of our eyes.
 Strange…
 No mistake about it.
 It seems that we're alreadywithin the enthusiastic welcome.
 Take a look at that.
 Oh, that can't be!
 What on earth is going on?
 No way!
 Is it Genjutsu…?
 So it seems.
 We were lured in perfectly.
 It appears we weremeticulously careful,
 and were made to walk aroundthe same place in a circle.
 We're being watched…
 Probably.
 They intend to wear downour physical strength and
 catch us unpreparedwhen we're bone-tired.
 If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
 Then... they'll be coming soon.
 They’ve appeared.
 Hah!
 This is the perfect handicap.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What's with these guys?
 Crawling out all of a sudden?
 Fighting in numbers isn't necessarilya good thing, you know?
 Since it's come to this,
 it'll be a comparison ofthe number of Clone Jutsu.
 I can get twice of twice oftwice of twice of your...
 Anyway, I'll multiplyto an incredible number!
 It doesn't matter if it'syour Genjutsu or whatever.
 I'll kick all their butts!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 I think we almost finishedshaking off the losers.
 Then I guess I'll moveonto the main issue.
 It has been 45 minutes, so I'll start.
 All right!
 Here is the tenth question!
 Here it comes!
 I have to put everything onthe line for this question!
 The Tenth Question: All or Nothing!
 Hmph! Making such a big deal.
 This is the final obstacle.
 Kankuro, come back already!
 If he starts the tenth question,your cheat sheet has no meaning!
 But before that,
 I'm going to addsome rules for the last question.
 Aren't you lucky?
 It looks like playing withthe dolls wasn't a waste, after all?
 This guy.
 He's figured Crow out!
 Anyway, sit down.
 Let me explain!
 These are
 the hopeless rules!
 Well, anyhow.
 There's nothing to do whenthe subordinates are gone, huh?
 Well, it'll get busy soon enough.
 Why?
 This year's first proctor...
 I hear it's that Ibiki Morino.
 Well then, passing the first examalready seems iffy.
 Of all the people, that sadist...
 Sadist?
 Kurenai, you're a new Jonin, so you wouldn't know.
 Who is this person?
 He is a pro, a professional.
 Professional? Of what?
 Torture and interrogation.
 What?!
 Well, there maybe no physical torturein the exam itself,
 but he's sure to use hishis skills as an interrogator
 to torment them psychologically.
 That is...
 Leaf Village Anbu'sTorture and Interrogation Unit Marshall,
 Ibiki Morino!
 Hopeless rules...?!
 First, you guys will have to choose
 whether or not you will takethis 10th question!
 Huh?!
 Choose whether or notto take the exam?
 What, choose?!
 What happens if you choose notto take the 10th exam?
 If you chose not to take the exam,then your score will be zero.
 In other words, you fail!
 And of course, the same goes forthe two others in the same group!
 W-What does that mean!
 Of course, everybody is going tochoose to take the exam!
 This is ridiculous!As if we have a choice!
 And... one more rule...
 Another one?!
 Finish with it already!
 If you chose to take it andare unable to answer it correctly,
 then you will have to...
 relinquish your rightof taking the Chunin Exam forever.
 What kind of ridiculous rule is that?!
 Besides, there are plentyof people here
 who have taken theChunin Exam many times!
 You're just unlucky.
 I make the rule this year.
 But I did give youthe option to go back!
 For those of you who aren't confident,you can choose not to take it
 and take the examnext year or the year after that.
 Oh! How terrible!
 If one out of the threechooses not to take the exam,
 then all three will be failed.
 If you do choose to take it,but get the wrong answer...
 then that person will be aGenin for the rest of their life!
 No matter what,the odds are against us!
 It's an impossible choicefor anyone with normal nerves!
 Then, let's begin...
 The 10th question…
 Those who will not be taking it,raise your hands!
 Once I confirm your number,I'll ask you to leave!
 What kind of a questionis it going to be….?
 Darn!
 If I get it wrong,I'll be a Genin for the rest of my life.
 I don't want that!
 But if I choose not take it...!
 then I'll fail Sasuke and Sakura, too!I don't want that either!
 I won't raise my hand!
 I'm confident thatI can answer it correctly.
 But…
 But Naruto! You're different!
 You should retreat this timeeven if it means to ignore us
 and think of your next chanceto take the Exam!
 I... I...
 I'm quitting!I'm not going to take it!
 #50 failed!
 # 130, #111 will befailed as well...
 I-I'm sorry...Gennai! Inaho!
 Darn...
 M-Me too!
 Me too!
 Naruto...
 Why don't you raise your hand?
 That guy...
 I am the super elite ninja
 who will be carryingthe name of the Hokage!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki,remember that!
 Shut up!
 I'm prepared to do anythingto become a Hokage!
 I will surpass the Hokage!
 And I will make all ofthe people in the village
 acknowledge my presence!
 He's always got such a one-track mind.
 Saying Hokage, Hokageall the time like a fool.
 I'm sorry, Naruto.
 It seems like...
 I don't want to...
 crush your unachievable dreams.
 That guy...
 Ibiki completely understands howthe human psyche works.
 And the most horrifying part is...
 that by cornering people psychologicallyhe controls their psyche and
 reveals the fundamentalweakness of a human.
 Don't underestimate me!I won't run!
 I'll take it!
 But even if I'm stuck beinga Genin forever,
 I will  become a Hokageno matter what it takes!
 I'm not scared!
 That guy, he wasn't eventhinking of us at all.
 Such audacity!
 That's right…
 That's exactly the kind of fool you are!
 I'll ask again.
 It's a choice that will alter your life.
 If you want to quit, now is your chance!
 I'm not going to take backmy words!
 That is my Way of Ninja!
 Huh... What a funny kid.
 He completely brushed awaythose kids' anxieties.
 78, huh? Much more leftthan I expected.
 It's going to be the same.No matter how much more I push it.
 I like your determination!
 Then...
 For those who are still here...
 The first exam...
 You have passed it!
 Huh?
 H-Hey, what does that mean?
 All of a sudden you're telling usthat we've passed!
 What about the 10th question?
 There wasn't sucha thing to begin with!
 Well, you can look at the choice youjust had to make as the 10th question!
 What?!
 Hey!
 Then, what were allthose nine questions for!
 It was just a waste of time!
 Not a waste...
 The objective of the nine questionswere already accomplished.
 To test your individual abilityto gather information!
 Ability to gather information?
 First…
 The focus of this test was
 on the system of determiningthe pass or failure
 based on the three-person groupsthat was proposed in the first rule.
 By grading the exam ona group basis,
 I added the unimaginable pressureof dragging down your teammates.
 I see, I see.
 I kind of felt that wasthe point of this test!
 No , you didn't!
 However...
 The questions on these tests weren'tthings that
 you Genin Ninja wouldhave been able to solve...
 So in that case…
 I imagined that most of you herewould have come to this conclusion:
 ""In order to score points,I'll have to cheat.""
 In other words,
 this exam was created under the premisethat you all would cheat!
 That being said,
 I had two Chunin in the groupwho knew all of the answers
 from whom you could cheat.
 What?! That's what it was?
 I had a hard time figuringout the guy.
 Yeah. Really...
 It was so obvious!
 There's something wrong with youif you didn't notice!
 Right, Hinata?!
 He... didn't realize it...
 However...
 those who just foolishly cheated,naturally were disqualified.
 That's because...
 Information, depending onthe time and situation,
 it will be more valuable than life.
 And in a mission or on a battlefield,
 you will always have to risk your lifeto fight for it!
 Horrible burn marks, nail puncturesand scratches...
 Those are signs of physical torture!
 When information is gathered
 and the enemy or a third partyfinds out about it,
 that information is no longerguaranteed to be correct.
 Just remember this.
 To be given the wrong information
 can bring a catastrophic blowto your friends and town.
 So that is why, out of necessity,we forced you guys to cheat
 in order to test your abilityto collect information.
 And we filtered out those whowere clearly lacking in those abilities.
 But...
 The last question doesn'tmake any sense.
 However...
 this 10th question wasthe main issue of this first exam.
 Huh?
 What do you mean?
 I'll explain.
 The tenth question was totake on the question, or not.
 Needless to say, it isa painful decision to make.
 Those who chose not totake on the question,
 would be immediately failedalong with their whole squad!
 Those who chose to answerthe question and got it wrong…
 would be robbed of their chanceto take the Exam forever.
 It really is an unfair question.
 Then, how about these two choices?
 Let's say that you guys didbecome a Chunin.
 The mission is to steala secret document!
 You have no idea how manyNinjas the enemy has,
 their ability, and other armamentthey may have.
 On top of that, there maybethe pitfall of an enemy trap.
 Now this mission...Will you take it? Or not take it?
 Because you want your life spared...
 Because your partners willbe put in danger...
 Can you get away fromdangerous missions?
 The answer is...
 No!
 There are going to be missionsyou cannot avoid
 no matter how risky ordangerous it may be!
 Showing your courage toyour teammates in a tight spot,
 and the ability to get throughthe hardships...
 This is the quality that is neededin a Chunin troop leader!
 In a pinch, there arethose who cannot risk their own fate,
 and those who waver and give uptheir chances
 because they think theywill have another chance.
 I believe that such fools who don't havestrong determination
 have no right to become a Chunin!
 For those of you who choseto take on the question,
 you can say that you have successfullyanswered the difficult 10th question!
 You shall be able to take onthe adversity that may lie in your way.
 You've passed through the gates!
 The fist exam for the Chunin Examhas been completed.
 I wish you well!
 All right! Wish us well!
 I did it! I did it! 					Yeaah!
 What a funny guy...
 W-What's going on?!
 Gosh, this one...
 You guys!
 This isn't the time to becelebrating!
 I'm the proctor for the second exam!Anko Mitarashi!
 Let's move ontothe next stage! Next!
 Follow me!
 Read the atmosphere.
 This proctor...ls kind of like Naruto.
 78?! Ibiki!You let 26 teams slide by?
 I guess, the first exam this time aroundwas too easy.
 It seems like this time,there are a lot of excellent candidates.
 Huh! Well, all right...
 I'll drop more than half of themin the second exam!
 M-More than half?
 I'm getting excited.
 I'll give you the details tomorrow.
 We'll be changing locations,
 so get information from your Joninabout the location and the time!
 That's it. You're dismissed.
 I didn't think that there would be a guythat would pass with a blank sheet.
 Naruto Uzumaki...He really is a funny guy.
 W-What is this place?!
 NO TRESPASSING
 This is the location forthe ""second exam"",
 the 44th Training Field.
 Also known as... the Forest of Death.
 The Forest of... Death?!
 I passed the first exam!
 I'm just going to hop, jumpand take a big step and...
 Huh? Konohamaru and the gang?
 Hey, you guys!
 if you want to play a Ninja game...
 No? What?You came here for a mission?!

37,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 If “Heaven” does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge,and prepare for the chance.
 If “Earth” does not exist,
 run the fields in searchof an advantage.
 Open the series of Heaven and Earth,and the perilous way shall be redressed…
 This is namely the secret of“the one that guides…”
 What’s that?
 It probably has to do with the scroll.
 I think this means we’re supposedto open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
 Okay then, I’m going to open it.
 Huh? What’s this?
 A man…?
 A person…?
 This is…a Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto! Sakura!Let go of the scroll!
 Oh...
 Wha--?!
 Y-You…
 Hi!
 It’s been a long time.
 Surviving the Cut!The Rookie Nine Together Again!
 W-What’s going on?
 It appears you guys have hada rough time of it.
 What?!
 Why are you appearing witha Summoning?
 At the end of this second exam,
 we Chunin are towelcome the test-takers.
 I just happened to be given
 the important task of beingthe messenger for you guys.
 Messenger…?!
 Just in time.
 Everyone…
 Congratulations on survivingthe second exam.
 To celebrate your passing,
 I’d like to treat you tosome Ichiraku ramen, but…
 Ohh... Cool!
 Uh-oh…
 H-Hey, Naruto!
 – Listen to the end…– Cool! Cool!
 Ramen! Ramen! 					Believe it!
 I’ve done great job!I’m the greatest!
 I so want to eat ramen!Believe it!
 He’s got so much energy.
 Yaaaay!
 Shut up!
 Man, that scatterbrained partof you is the same as always, eh.
 I see.
 Huh?
 If we had looked at the scrollin the middle of the exam,
 what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei?
 Sasuke, you’re a sharp one,as usual.
 You guessed right.
 The rules of this exam were to testyour conclusive mission execution ability.
 To put it simply,
 in the case of the scrolls being openedcontrary to the rules…
 In the case of them being opened…?
 I was ordered to knock unconsciousthe test-takers in front of me
 until the end of the exam.
 Good thing you didn’t open the scroll.
 Kabuto, thank you!
 Phew!
 That was seriously close…
 Oh yeah, Sensei!
 Huh?
 By the way,what’re the letters on that wall?
 They’re kind of vermiculated and
 we don’t understandtheir meaning at all.
 Never mind, never mind!
 We passed!
 No…explaining that isone more of my duties.
 What, really?
 I’m saying that’s right.
 Give it a read.
 These are Chunin instructionsMaster Hokage recorded.
 Instructions?!
 That’s right!
 Heaven in this textrefers to the human head.
 Earth refers to the human body.
 No kidding…
 If “Heaven” does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge,and prepare for the chance.
 In other words…
 If your weaknesses areinside your head, Naruto…
 learn various logics inpreparing for your missions.
 Hah! So meddlesome!
 If “Earth” does not exist,
 run through the fieldsin search of an advantage.
 If your weaknesses are inyour physical strength, Sakura,
 it means you must notslack off on your daily training.
 And if you combine bothHeaven and Earth…
 Any perilous mission is the right way…
 In other words…
 what can also be called a ruleof might and become a safe mission.
 Then, what aboutthe spot with the missing letter?
 The letter refers to Chunin.
 The one letter for “person” thatwas in the scroll from earlier goes there.
 These five days of survivalwere to test
 the test-takers’ fundamentalabilities as Chunin.
 And you guys cleared it in fine style.
 Chunin is of unit-leader class.
 They have the responsibilityof leading a team.
 Be more deeply aware ofthe necessity of physical strength…
 and knowledge in missions!
 I want you to take onthe next step,
 never forgetting theseChunin instructions.
 That is all of the messenger taskI was given.
 Got it!
 Huh?
 But, as for the final third exam,don’t push it too far.
 Especially you, Naruto.
 – You’re the biggest worry…– Iruka Sensei.
 From when I received theLeaf headband,
 I was no longeran Academy student, you know?!
 There’s nothing to worry!Believe it!
 Also, this is the proof yougave me that I’m full-fledged, right?!
 That I’m scatterbrained maynot have changed,
 but I’m not a kid anymore!
 I'm now...
 A Ninja!
 I see.
 I’m sorry, Naruto.
 I know their strength the best.
 If it’s futile anyway,
 I would like to give themthe final word personally.
 If you’re that hung up on it,I can leave that team to you.
 To think you’d play the devil’s advocate…
 Thank you very much.
 But, they’re Kakashi’s, right?
 If he’s the one whorecommended them,
 I thought I could count on them.
 Stay out of it!
 They’re not your students anymore.They’re my subordinates now.
 The one who might truly understand
 the strength of these kids.might be you, Kakashi.
 How is it?
 Does the Curse Mark still hurt?
 No.
 Thanks to you,it’s gotten quite a bit better.
 Anyway, Orochimaru is oneof those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right?
 He’s a S-rank bingo bookrouge Shinobi
 who even the Anbu couldn’t touch, right?
 I heard that he’d already died, but…
 Why’d he come to this village now…?
 There’s a kid I want, you see.
 This kid inherits the abilitiesof the Uchiha clan, so…
 It's...
 It’s probably Sasuke, right?
 Huh?!
 Master Anko!
 Twenty-one second examfinishers have been confirmed.
 As for the third exam, accordingto the regulations of the Chunin Exams,
 preliminaries are planned forthe first time in five years.
 The second exam is over.
 For the time being,continue the exams as is,
 but while keepingan eye on his movements.
 Yes…
 First off, congratulations onfinishing the second exam.
 There were seventy-eighttest-takers for the second exam.
 To think twenty-one havemade it this far.
 I said to make it less than half,but I’d really thought about single digits.
 I’m hungry!
 There are still this many remaining?
 This is such a major pain.
 Sasuke and others have passed, too.
 Of course…
 We went to that much troubleto save them…
 It’d all be for naught if they didn’t pass.
 Your team didn’t do too bad.
 I guess they were lucky.
 But as long as my team is around,they can’t go any higher.
 After all, whether youlike it or not,
 ability talks at the next barrier.
 Well, adolescence can sometimesbe bittersweet and
 can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi…
 Did you say something?
 Oh my God!
 Not bad, my rival Kakashi.
 But that part of you is so hip...which is what annoys me!
 So that’s Guy Sensei’s eternal rival, eh?
 Guy Sensei totally loses visually…
 Guy Sensei is the hippestof all the teachers!
 He shines!
 Okay!
 Please watch, Guy Sensei!I’ll shine, too!
 I don’t ever want to seetears of those dear to me again.
 So…
 I won’t ever lose again!
 Guy Sensei.
 Sure enough, the outstanding candidateshave gathered.
 Sasuke Uchiha, eh?
 I’ll get you back for my arms,Sasuke Uchiha…
 At any cost.
 To think a mere seven teamsare left of the twenty-six…
 Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt.
 Akamaru’s acting strange…
 Those Sand Village guys…
 Naruto passed, too.
 Thank goodness…
 What, all the Leaf Villagerookies are here.
 Say! Say!
 Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei andeven Intense-Brow are here. Believe it!
 It feels like everyone’s assembled.
 Humph…I don’t have a very good feeling.
 To think this many are left…
 Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookies…
 So that’s why they fought in recommending them.
 Now then, we will now havethe explanation of the third exam
 from Master Hokage.
 Listen carefully, everybody!
 Now then, if you will,Master Hokage.
 All right.
 Before the explanation ofthe third exam that we will start from now,
 I have just one thing I wantto tell everyone flat out.
 About the true purpose of these exams.
 True purpose…?!
 Why do allied nations conductthe exams on a conjoint basis?
 Huh?
 Raising the levels of the shinobiand friendship among allied nations.
 It won’t do to have the wrong ideaof the true meaning of that statement.
 These exams are so to speak…
 So to speak…?
 A microcosm of battlebetween allied nations.
 What does that mean?
 If we look back on history,
 the allied nations of today wereonce neighboring nations
 that continued to vie witheach other and battle for power.
 In order to avoid a futile crushingof each others’ military strength,
 those nations mutually selecteda place to battle.
 And that was how theChunin Exams originally began.
 W-Why do we haveto do such a thing?
 We’re not doing this toselect Chunins?!
 There is no question that these examsare to select Shinobi
 worthy of becoming Chunin.
 But on the other hand,
 these exams also provide a venue
 for Shinobi who carry their nation’s prideon their backs to fight for their lives!
 Nation’s pride…?
 Many feudal lords and those ofprominence from many nations
 who request Shinobi for workare invited to this third exam as guests.
 And, the feudal lords andHead Ninja of each Village
 of the nations will watch your battles.
 If the gap in national powerbecomes unbridgeable,
 the strong nations are inundatedwith job requests.
 The requests of nations deemedweak, on the other hand, decline.
 And therewithal,
 we can exert pressure uponeach neighboring nation...
 That is to say, just how much militarystrength our Village is developing and has.
 Even so, why is it necessary forus to fight for our lives?!
 The nation’s strength isthe Village’s strength.
 The Village’s strength isthe Shinobi’s strength.
 And the true strength of the Shinobiis created only in a fight for one’s life!
 This exam is a place to seethe strength of home country Shinobi,
 and a place to display this as well.
 It is because it’s an exam whereyou truly fight for your life
 that this has meaning.
 It’s for this very reason thatyour forerunners fought in this exam,
 a dream worth striving for.
 Then why…use the expression “friendship”?!
 I said it at the start, didn’t I?!
 That it won’t do for you to havethe wrong idea of the meaning!
 It’s a custom where balance ispreserved by fighting and removing life.
 This is the friendshipof the Shinobi world.
 This is a fight for life withthe pride of the village and
 one’s own dream on the line.
 Heh, I’m convinced.
 Anything is fine.
 Just tell us the content ofthat fight-for-life test.
 Very well.
 Now then, this is where I’d like toexplain the third exam.
 But actually…
 Master Hokage, please allow me,Hayate Gekko,
 who was given the task of judge, to speak first.
 I leave it to you…
 Nice to meet you, everyone…
 Umm, there’s something…I'd like you all to do...
 before the third exam.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What's the idea?Sudden preliminaries?
 Didn't we just get to the tower?Also, something's wrong with Sasuke.
 It's too much for you, Sasuke!Please, drop out!
 You're in no conditionto fight properly!
 No matter what you say,
 I'm going to tell the teachersabout that bruise.
 Next episode: ""Narrowing the Field:Sudden Death Elimination!""
 Sasuke, I'm scared.

 As for me…I stand by my words.
 That’s…my Way of Ninja!
 If you die, there will be no dreams,no nothing!
 Just get out of the way!Run away!
 Just like our wager,
 I will definitely winthat unlucky necklace from you.
 I…
 I will absolutely not dieuntil I’ve become Hokage!
 This way, I can hold on to you.Here I go!
 I-It can’t be…
 The Fifth Hokage!A Life on the Line!
 Rasengan!
 This is…?!
 Way to go, Naruto.
 That Nine-Tailed Fox kid…
 a kid like that,doing a technique like that…
 I-It can’t be…
 He can’t be, really…
 In only one week,that Rasengan…
 You… Even after you receivedthat Jutsu…?!
 I gathered the Chakra in my stomach,
 and before I received the JutsuI had started healing.
 The reason why Orochimaru favors me…
 is not because of my use of Jutsuor my sense for Jutsu…
 It is because my recuperative power.
 The power to energize cellsand make new cells.
 On the other hand…I’ve used up almost all of my Chakra.
 That Jutsu…seems it was Naruto’s last effort…
 Wh-What?!
 I-It can’t be…
 Even with my powers of recuperation,this much damage.
 I don’t…have…enough Chakra.
 Arrhythmia!
 Drats! His heart muscle is in tatters…
 Why did that happen…?
 That moment?!
 At that moment of release…
 did he shred the musclesaround his heart…?
 Stop shaking!
 Hey, Big Brother Gamakichi.
 Are we really getting a snack?That guy looks like he’s going to die.
 You’re annoying! Be quiet!
 It’s all over…for Naruto.
 I…cut…his heart’s Chakra Networkwhich restores the strength…
 through the Nine-Tail’s Chakra…
 With all my strength.
 In order to eliminate the possibilitythat he would heal with his own power.
 There's no way he can recover…
 Even with you.
 Shut up!
 I’ll kill you later…
 He’s stopped breathing…!
 Dammit!
 Dammit!
 Dammit!
 It’s dark…
 Dark…
 Why is it getting dark?
 My strength is… Why…?
 What…?
 Don’t die…
 Don’t die!
 Don’t die!
 Don’t die!
 Don’t die!
 The bet…
 I won it.
 I-It’s impossible…
 “Hokage is…my dream,” eh?
 For the last time…
 For the last time…
 Just one more time…
 I want to bet on you…
 That child, he’s not well…
 Tsunade is a medical specialist.
 Don’t worry, there’s no need toworry about Naruto’s body.
 That’s not what I meant.
 What?
 Your battle is with me,there’s no time to look away.
 Who would have imagined this?
 If that child is found by the Akatsuki,there will be trouble.
 In other words,if I'm to kill him…
 now is the time!
 Shoot!
 He’s aiming at this child!
 Tsunade… You’re the only oneI wasn’t going to kill…
 If that child lives,
 there will be trouble in the futureon a variety of levels.
 Don’t get in my way.
 This is one child…
 This is one child…I will absolutely protect!
 Trembling at the sight of blood,why would you, one of the Sannin,
 risk your life to protect that Genin kid?
 To protect…
 my hometown…the Leaf Village…!
 To protect the Leaf Village…?
 Because…because…
 this small child…
 is the kid who will becomeHokage some day…
 What utter nonsense…
 By the way…to hell with Hokage!
 Only a fool does that job.
 To hell with Hokage!Only a fool does that job.
 The wishes of the two…
 More importantly, Lady Tsunade,your wish…
 Have you forgotten your dream?
 The successive lines of Hokagehave protected
 the Leaf Village andand those living in it.
 They brought troubled times under controland helped the village to prosper.
 They risked their livesfor this dream, this ideal!
 Anyone who makes fun of the old manand the Fourth Hokage…
 It doesn’t matter ifyou are a woman!
 I’ll clobber you with all my might!
 And now,I also will put my life on the line!
 If your life is worth throwing awayfor a kid like him… !
 Then dying now would bea fitting end!
 All that’s left…is Naruto.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Make it in time!
 She’s still able to move evenafter I pierced her down to her lungs!
 You mean you’ll still protect that kid?!
 That’s what I said…
 From now…
 I’m putting my life on the line!
 You, half-dead corpse!
 No matter how cool you try to be,your trembling doesn’t stop.
 You can’t get away fromthe curse of hemophobia.
 And yet, why would youtake the blows for that kid?
 Why would you battle for the Leaf?
 No way!
 Tsunade’s trembling has…
 has stopped?
 That is because…I am…
 the Leaf Village’s…Fifth Hokage!
 That sign is?!
 Lady Tsunade has conqueredher fear of blood,
 but that’s…
 What are you saying you’ll do,after all this time?
 You can’t fight with that woundeven if you’ve conquered your fear.
 W-Wait! I’ll treat that wound.So don’t release that seal!
 Tsunade: Release the Secret Seal!
 Ninja Art: Mitotic Regeneration!
 What is this Jutsu…?!
 It looks like I’m not the only onewho develops new Jutsu.
 What in the world is this Jutsu?
 Well…
 For many years I’ve stored Chakrain my forehead.
 The mass of Chakra stimulateda variety of proteins.
 The number of times my cells dividespeeds to a dizzying rate…
 The cells rebuild…
 and all the organs and body systemsare revitalized.
 It’s not the ability to restore,it’s the ability to reincarnate.
 That means I won’t die…from battles.
 But the number of times a person’s cellsdivide in their lifetime is fixed…
 If that is sped up,it essentially shortens the life!
 Lady Tsunade!
 That action is…
 Lord Orochimaru!
 Come out!
 Hurry!
 Ino, inu, saru, tori, hitsuji!
 – Summoning Jutsu!– Summoning Jutsu!
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 The time to conclude this long, fatefulconfrontation has come, Orochimaru.
 You have sunk too deeply into vice.
 You are no longer a comrade!
 Comrade? How odious.
 That word makes me shiver.
 I will bring you down!
 Today is the last day thatwe are called Sannin!

 Huh?! What ?! What?!
 This is it!
 Wow!
 They're breathable andmoisture-wicking,
 and perfectly designed for free movement,all in a beautiful, stylish package.
 You'll notice a difference immediatelyif you train with them on!
 They're going to grow on you!
 Before long, you'll be wanting towear them all the time like Lee!
 Of course, I have a thing for them, too!
 Woooow!
 Why couldn’t you bring a mirroror something
 instead of carrying aroundthose things, you dork!
 Do you think they'll look good on me?
 Don't even think about it.Get a load of that…
 Now that is truly dorky.
 Okay! This is the place!
 Here?!
 The gambling house frequentedby the entire town…
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priorityplaced by our organization, Akatsuki!
 What's wrong?
 Pervy Sage… Why are they after me?
 You know, don't you, Pervert Sage?Tell me why…
 They're not really after you…They're after what's inside of you.
 What on earth is this thing?
 It's a horrible demon thatattacked Leaf Village, right?
 And was dreaded by all.
 So why do they want it so much?
 Indeed, the Nine-Tailed Foxis a demon
 that appears at each critical juncturethroughout the ages
 destroying everything in its path…
 And people feared it likean act of nature.
 The reason they want that thing…for what purpose.
 Honestly, I can't quite say.
 Just that now that Nine-Tailed Foxis sealed up inside of you…
 they might be thinkingthey want that power in their control.
 It must be harsh to know
 that Ninja like themwould keep coming after you…
 But well, that's your destiny!
 Now don’t you worry,I'm going to protect--
 Then there's nothing to dobut hurry up and get stronger! I've got to!
 Okay! Let's go find that Tsunade person,
 have her save Sasukeand get down to some serious training!
 That's just like this kid…
 A New Training Begins:I Will Be Strong!
 Th-This place has the highest antes…!
 Don't go fretting overevery little thing!
 Let's go!
 Oh dear! Please wait!
 Hmm?
 What?
 The beautiful woman youwant to ""research"" on…
 That's this Tsunade person?
 Whoa! That’s sharp coming from you!And what about it?
 She's part of the Sannin thinglike you, right, Pervy Sage?
 Yes, and what of it?
 How…old is she?
 My age.
 Heck, she's an old lady.
 Yikes!
 Huh?!
 Th-This woman is…!
 Would you mind changing allof this money into chips for me?
 Oh no! She's really going for it!
 Just who is this? This lady…
 You don't know?
 She's that woman withthe famous alias…
 Famous alias…?
 So, well…what kind of personis this Tsunade like?
 Oh, you want to know?
 Yeah.
 Let's see…
 Put simply, she's an unpleasant type.
 Besides that, she's a diehard gamblerand her face is known far and wide for it.
 Then we should have no problemsfinding her!
 If she's that famous!
 She's famous, all right…Legendary, you might say…
 Boss, what's this alias…?
 The Legendary…
 Legendary…?
 Oh dear! They're all laughing!
 – Legendary… 					– Legendary…
 Sitting Duck!
 Yup! But no matter how famousLegendary Sitting Duck is,
 I doubt we'll find her right away.
 Why not?!
 She hates growing old so much
 she's probably used some special Jutsuto change her appearance.
 She's actually 50 years old,
 but no doubt she looks likeshe did when she was 20…
 And not just that,recently I heard that…
 she transforms into her teens or30s or 40s as the situation calls for
 to escape moneylenders.
 What?! That's a horrible thing to do!
 Tsunade has always lovedto gamble more than anything
 But she has terrible luck and no skill.
 She was always being playedfor the Sitting Duck and the name stuck…
 Then she was always borrowing moneyand skipping out on her debts, too…
 Ah, it brings back memories.
 This is no time to begetting all nostalgic!
 Tell me, how do you proposewe go about finding her?!
 Well…
 We may very well have toput our noses to the ground,
 but we're not without our little tricks.
 What?! So you have no ideahow long it's gong to take?!
 We won't be wasting any time.
 All of our time on the roadwill be your time.
 My time?
 Time to make you strong…Training!
 Okay!
 No, no… I told you that is definitely out.
 I won't be seen walking with someonedressed like that.
 Come on, Pervy Sage!Let's hurry up and start training!
 Now now, don't get ahead of yourself…
 The training won't mean anything
 unless it's done in the process ofgathering information on Tsunade.
 Huh? Gathering information…?
 In this town.
 Wow!
 Cool! This is my first timefor this kind of thing!
 Down time is important, too!
 You go have yourself some funbefore we start training.
 The festival should continuefor some time.
 We'll stay here in this cityfor the duration.
 We'll train here, too!
 All right!
 Whoa! That's a fat wallet!You're rich!
 I have quite a bit!
 I've saved it little by littlethroughout my missions.
 Well then!
 – Wait! Naruto! 					– Huh?
 I'll hold on to your wallet for you!
 Wh-What do you think you're doing?!
 You can spend this much…
 What?! Only 300 ryo!
 No complaints!
 Remember Shinobi must honorthe "" Shinobi’s Three Taboos""!
 Shinobi’s Three Taboos…?What's that?
 What?! You don't know!
 The ""three taboos"" arethe three temptations
 that will bring Shinobi to ruin!
 The three temptations arebooze, women and money…
 Oh, then this doesn't really applyto me all that much!
 I'm minor, so I can't drink yet!I don't quite get the women thing!
 And I worked so hardto save all that money,
 I don't really feel much like using it…
 You fool! Don't you underestimatethe desire for money!
 Once you start using it,it goes really fast!
 Money has a frightful power.
 This Tsunade we are goingto be looking for
 has ruined herself over it!
 Your desire for women is always getting the better of you, too, Pervy Sage!
 I'm going onan information-gathering mission!
 Here, you hold on to my bag for me!
 If you get lost,
 my tracking SummonsToadwill follow my scent!
 He's really just a child after all,contrary to appearances…
 Okay! First, I'll get a little something to eat!
 I’ll take one order ofoctopus dumplings, sir!
 Right!
 – Potatoes with butter please!– You got it!
 – I want chocolate bananas.– Right!
 – I want apricot candy!– Thank you!
 – I want okonomiyaki too!– Here you go! Watch out, it's hot!
 One extra-large orderof fried noodle, sir!
 Right…But my you've gota lot of food there, young man!
 You don't planto eat it all yourself now, do you?!
 Eh? As a matter of fact,I am gong to eat it all myself.
 Oh, um, here you go…
 I think I ate a bit too much.
 I wonder how everyone is?
 Kakashi Sensei… Sasuke… Sakura…
 I'm going to train hard every dayand come back stronger.
 Just you wait and see!
 But before that…I better work off that meal!
 Last one!
 – All right! Perfect!– Oh! Amazing!
 That's the fruit of hard trainingthrowing shuriken.
 You stink, sonny!
 Hah! Gosh darn it!Well, just watch this!
 Hold it!
 Huh?
 Attention: Shinobi!Ninjutsu strictly forbidden!
 Thanks now!
 You shouldn't try to walk aroundwith the mask on.
 It's Pervy Sage’s bank saving book.
 One, ten, one hundred…
 L-Look at all those zeros!
 He should be treating me now and thenif he has this much money.
 Stingy old geezer!
 There's only a little left… .One more stand and that will be it…
 Time to make you strong…Training!
 Two grilled squids please, sir!Make one of those an adult size!
 Okay! Someone sent youto buy some squid, eh?!
 I'll throw in a child size for free!Coming right up!
 Hurray for you, sir!You're a man among men!
 Oh, you can tell, eh?! All right!I'll give you the adult one for half price!
 Thanks!
 Good grief, where did he go to?!
 Huh? The voice of Pervy Sage?
 Young ladies are so nice.
 Oh, Naruto! You've already hadyou're fill of the festival?
 Repeat those three Shinobi Taboos again!
 You're breaking all three at once!You bastard!
 W-Wait, Naruto…
 N-No, I won't wait!
 You used all my hard-saved money!
 – Take this and this and this!– N-Naruto, stop!
 I'll pay it all back!I'm sorry, p-please!
 You! You!You made my froggy wallet all flat!
 Hey! Look what you did, you urchin!
 You stained Leader's designer suit!You'll have to pay for it!
 Fork over 100,000 ryo!
 What?! You're telling methat suit cost 100,000 ryo?!
 Yeah, really, that's quite a stretch
 to say a dorky suit like thatcost 100,000 ryo.
 Are you asking for it?!
 You better put a lid on itif you know what's good for you.
 The leader used be a Chunin fromthe Hidden Village of Stones,
 the legendary dark Ninja, feared by all!
 Come again? Legendary what?
 You seem to want to get hurt!
 Naruto.
 Perfect timing.
 I'll show you a Jutsu now…Watch very carefully!
 Now you've done it!
 A-Amazing!
 I was holding back quite a bit…You guys are so weak.
 A-Are you? The…legendary…
 I'm sorry…We kind of destroyed your stand…
 H-Here… Fix it with this.
 Oh! Thanks.
 Would you mind if I bought allyour balloons and water balloons
 at the same time, my man?
 Fine by me…
 That wasn’t an ordinary hand move…
 What in blazes was that?!That Jutsu!
 Naruto!
 Come with me! It’s training time!
 Yes, sir!
 Finally, the mood is rightfor a little training.
 – Here! Water balloon!– Wha--?
 Eh?! What is it for?!
 You saw that Jutsu I just used, right?
 Y-Yeah.
 What Jutsu did it look like to you?
 It looked like you madeyour opponent spin violently.
 His perspective's off…But I guess that's to be expected.
 Right, okay… Yes, spinning!
 He's spinning the water in the balloonwithout moving his hand?!
 Whoa!
 The tree-climbing exercise
 to learn to gather andmaintain Chakra in necessary places…
 The Walk-on-Water exercise
 to learn how to releasea set amount of Chakra…
 You did both of these, right?
 And now with this water balloon exercise,
 you'll learn how to createa stream of Chakra…
 In other words, spinning.
 Create a stream of Chakra…
 I'll give a more detailed explanationof the Jutsu
 once you get these first steps down.
 First, you must gatherand maintain Chakra in your hand
 using the tree-climbing technique.
 Then you must continuouslyrelease Chakra
 using the Walk-on-Water technique.
 Then you push and churn the waterin the balloon with the Chakra!
 I get it!
 Then you spin the waterin the balloon faster and faster
 until the balloon pops!
 You're catching onmore and more quickly!
 Okay, today we're goingto train until evening!
 Yes, sir!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools
 I will break this water balloonno matter what!
 Hey, you're full of spirit!
 Perhaps I can expect himto master the Jutsu.
 The water inside the balloonis moving.
 By the way, when does that pop?
 Next time: “Keep on Training:Pop Goes the Water Balloon!”
 Aw geez! Why won't it pop?!

 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left

 Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Wh-What is that Jutsu?!
 Damn it!
 Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
 I’ll win no matter what!
 Don’t flatter yourself!
 Stop it!
 Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds
 It’s a tranquil village as always…
 The security sucks.
 Humph!
 We should just massacre everybodyin such a seedy village.
 Calm down, Sakon.
 We haven’t come here to fight.
 Shut up, you chicken.
 If you’re scared,
 you should just go homeand go to bed already.
 I’m telling you to calm down, Tayuya.
 You understand whatour job is this time, right?
 Let’s go.We escort our special guest.
 Stop it!
 Damn.
 I can’t stop completely.
 Kakashi Sensei?
 Naruto… That thing you just did was…
 What’re you guys doingup on top of the hospital?
 You went a bit too farfor just a fight, you two.
 That Jutsu earlier, no mistake.
 It’s the Rasengan.
 What’s going on?
 How can Naruto use that Jutsu…?
 Were you going to kill Naruto, Sasuke?
 What’re you doing giving yourself overto a sense of superiority?
 The size of the Chidori therewasn’t one to be aimed
 at a comrade of the same village.
 Why such infantile behavior…?
 Sure enough, a reunion with Itachi…
 Sasuke.
 Damn it!
 Naruto…
 How far will you go…?
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Whatever happened to teamwork?
 Was it you…who taught him that technique?
 I think Naruto is still too youngto be handling that Jutsu.
 He could’ve killed Sasukehad something gone wrong…
 Even if it’s a means of resistingthe Akatsuki,
 to think you would teach Narutothat Jutsu…
 Right back at you…
 That Chidori was also considerably hairy.
 But I didn’t think he wasthe kind of kid
 who’d fire that Jutsu at his comrade.
 Or is it that there’s something quitecomplicated between him and that kid?
 Well, all sorts.
 All sorts?
 Quite simply, it’s a relationship
 like the one between youand Orochimaru in the past.
 I see.
 To him, Sasuke is a comradeand a rival at the same time…
 Well, someone he considersan equal.
 Most likely, he couldn’t takeSasuke’s cheap provocation.
 He’s been chasing him…
 Chasing him since the Academy days.
 Are you hurt…
 Scaredy-Cat?
 Sasuke!
 I won’t lose to you!
 For him, it’s neither younor me now…
 More than anyone…
 he wants to be recognized by Sasuke.
 On the other side of the coin…
 Sasuke feels the speed of Naruto’s growthat close range and feels inferior.
 To the extent that he thinkshe himself isn’t growing at all.
 Scaredy-Cat?
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto has gotten strong…
 And Sasuke…
 I’m going to kill a certain man,no matter what.
 Revenge, huh…?
 I wonder if Itachiis frustrating that kid.
 So Sasuke doesn’t wantto acknowledge Naruto.
 If he acknowledges him,
 he just might deny himselfup to this point…
 Rivalry is a difficult thing.
 It’s not a very good trend…
 Maybe I’ll do some scolding.
 Then I leave Naruto to you.
 Well, I have a mission.And there’s the Chidori thing, too…
 Sakura.
 It’s okay. Things can go back to the waythey were in the old days again.
 Cheer up.
 See ya.
 Thanks, Kakashi Sensei.
 Naruto…
 Sakura.
 Don’t interfere with us!
 You are weak.
 Why are you weak?
 It's because you don’t have enough…
 …hate.
 What’ve I been doing…
 up until now?
 He got a nice look in those eyes.
 Shall we go soon?
 What do you think you’re doing?
 If I don’t do this,you’ll run away, right?
 You’re not the typeto listen quietly to lectures.
 As I recall,that’s Kakashi the Copy Ninja.
 Sasuke… Forget about somethinglike revenge.
 What?
 Well, in this businessI’ve seen a stink of guys like you.
 But the final days of those who speakof revenge are never good.
 They’re tragic.
 You’ll only hurt yourself andagonize more than now.
 Even if you succeed in revenge,all that will remain is emptiness.
 Shut up!
 What do you know?
 Don’t talk to me as if you know!
 Well, calm down…
 If you like,
 shall I go and kill the personmost important to you?
 You’ll be able to realize justhow far off you are
 on what you just said.
 Well, I wouldn’t mind if you’d do that.
 Unfortunately, I don’t even haveone person like that.
 Everyone’s already been killed.
 I’ve lived longer than you have…
 The times were not good.
 I know all too wellthe agony of losing something.
 Well, both you and Iaren’t the lucky ones…
 That’s for darned sure.
 But we’re not the worst, either.
 You and I,
 we both have already founddear comrades, haven’t we?
 It’s because I have lostthat I understand.
 The Chidori is a power…
 I gave to you becauseyou now have something important.
 You should know thatit’s not a power
 to be used on your comradeor to use for revenge,
 and I’m sure you knowwhat it should be used for.
 Think hard about whether or notwhat I’m saying is wrong.
 It’ll be tricky with a Shinobiof that level hanging around.
 So let’s wait a bit.
 Maybe jerks like you’d be no good.But I could do it.
 I wonder. “Two”should be ample to rip him apart.
 Don’t be butting in all the time,you clod.
 Tayuya, women shouldn’tuse words like that too…
 Shut up, fatso.
 – More, please!– More, please!
 Wanna head back?
 Sure!
 We both made itto the top of the tree.
 Sakura.
 I have a something to talkto you about.
 I’ll go out on a date with you,so come along.
 Damn it…
 Damn it!
 The Curse Mark left by Orochimaruduring the Chunin Exam…
 Kakashi Sensei saidit was okay now, but…
 Master Orochimaru.
 You didn’t need to send outall four members, did you?
 It seems those kids are all interestedin Sasuke to whom I've taken a liking.
 To see what extent his power is…
 A contest of strength or whatever,
 at this point Sasuke would beno match for them.
 That is precisely why…he will come to mein search of power.
 Who’re you guys?
 I’m Kidomaru, the East Gateof the Sound Ninja Four.
 I’m Sakon,the West Gate of the same.
 I’m Jirobo,the South Gate of the same.
 I’m Tayuya,the North Gate of the same.
 I’m in a bad mood now…

 I won’t go easy on you!

 What do you want to eat, Sakura?
 Anything's fine.
 At any rate,Kakashi Sensei's over the top.
 I just wanted to fightSasuke a little.
 But if Kakashi Sensei hadn't stopped it,right about now…
 Of course, which of us was strongerwould be settled, believe it.

 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,

 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.

 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 Wait, Naruto!
 I won’t wait.
 I told you not to be actingon your own.
 Then you’re saying toleave Sumaru be?!
 Sumaru just now seemedquite upset…
 He’s definitely intending toget revenge on Akahoshi.
 Now that he’s been tarred withthe reputation of Rogue Ninja,
 he’ll have no place to gothroughout his life
 if he raises a hand againstthe village leader.
 Hokuto?
 Mother!
 I finally…
 Here, I finally got to meet you…
 Mother.
 The Star's Radiance
 Wh-What’re you doing?
 Shh! Don’t be acting onyour own anymore.
 But, something’s strange.
 This number of Ninja isindeed something serious.
 It seems they’ve mobilized allof the village Ninja.
 Anyway, we should seehow things go for a little while.
 Byakugan!
 Sumaru’s inside the training room…
 Hey, what about Sumaru’s mom?
 Damn it!
 Sumaru…
 Do we really have to do awaywith him?
 He’s still a kid.Wouldn’t it be okay to let things slide?
 At this moment,he’s a dangerous element.
 No good would comeof letting him live.
 But Sumaru’s beenthe most effective Genin in the village.
 We have more thanenough materials…
 We can just train more…
 Materials…?!
 I won’t stand for it anymore!Leave it to me!
 – Forget about it.– Let go of me!
 I’m going to kickthat Akahoshi jerk’s butt.
 This is a Star Village issue.
 Village issues have to be resolvedby those in the village.
 Isn’t there somethingwe can do for him?
 That’s right.
 Let’s charge on in andbox Akahoshi’s ears…
 What’re you saying?
 That’d be the same as Naruto!
 Are you saying we mustremain idle spectators
 even when things have gone this far?!
 That’s right!
 As long as there’s no commission fromthe village to kick Akahoshi’s butt,
 there’s nothing we can do.
 Archer unit! Forward!
 Fire!
 Until now, I felt resentment towards you,Mother, for leaving me behind.
 But…I understand clearly now.
 I understand why youhad to do that.
 Akahoshi… I will never forgive him!
 Sumaru…
 Wh-What a pitiful mother and son, eh?!
 What’re you talking about…?
 I buried them both together…There is no greater happiness.
 Incredible Chakra!
 Wait!
 This jerk’s an enemy...He suddenly attacked.
 You’re Leaf Shinobi, right?
 I can tell even if you give methe runaround…
 The people from other landsare all after the star.
 If you have that power,
 you can stand above all ofthe Hidden Villages.
 Is your awesome Chakra alsothe power of the star?
 If they had that star,
 would everyone havethe same Chakra as you?
 No! The more tremendous the power,
 the more hard work is requiredto control it!
 I’ll work hard, work hard, work hard!
 I’ll become the Hoshikage!
 Yeah! I look forward to workingwith you at that time!
 I’m also going to becomethe Hokage someday, believe it!
 You’re a strange guy.
 Really?
 That red star sure is pretty…
 Natsuhiboshi…
 It watches over me all the time…
 Are you still gonna sayI should bear it after all this?
 Sumaru!
 Sumaru…
 Listen, everyone.
 If you continue the star training,you’ll all die.
 Sumaru’s mother is the onewho took away the star.
 She did that in order toprotect everyone’s lives!
 Lord Akahoshi?
 Is it true that we’ll die?
 Are you going to believesuch nonsense?!
 Being unable to withstandthe star training
 is because the heart that lovesthe village is weak!
 Those who really love the villagecan become true Shinobi
 and can also surpass the Hidden Villagesof the Five Great Nations!
 Hokuto or Lord Akahoshi…Who’s telling the truth?
 Mizura?!
 In that condition…!lt’s reckless!
 Wait, everyone!
 There’s… There’s somethingI want everyone to see.
 Mizura…
 What’s that?
 What’s going on?
 Is that the effect of the training?
 How awful.
 Lord Akahoshi… I take pride inthe Hidden Star Village.
 Even though it was painful,
 I endured it and continuedthe star training…
 Even so, were my feelings forthe village still not enough?
 Mizura!
 I don’t think there could be liesin that child’s words…and body.
 Yes. So that’s whythe Third Hoshikage prohibited
 the star training for a long while.
 We adults got carried away withour feelings for the village
 and may have made the wrong choice…
 You loser!
 Do you intend to mislead everyoneand crush the village?!
 What’re you doing, Akahoshi?!
 They aren’t traitors.
 They’re children of our village!
 Protect Hokuto and Mizura.
 Are you going to betray the village?!
 I can’t go along with your wayof doing things, Lord Akahoshi!
 Me, too.
 Me, too!
 Me, too.
 Me, too.
 Death to those who betray the village!
 Execute them all!
 Are you insane, Akahoshi?
 If we lost all the children,there’d be no future for the village!
 H-Hey…You’re taking things too far, Akahoshi.
 Take everyone’s feelings intoconsideration and yield for now.
 Shut up!What’re you doing talking nice now?
 We’ve long since dirtied our hands.
 S-Stop! What’re you going to say?
 Akahoshi, what do you mean?
 There’s a star in this village thatno other villages possess.
 I just thought we didn’t needa foolish village leader
 who wouldn’t allow the star to be used.
 What?!
 Could it be that you are the ones whokilled the Third Hoshikage?!
 Indeed, there were suspicious rumorsconcerning the Third Hoshikage’s death.
 Akahoshi, prepare yourselfand answer!
 You’ll pay depending on your answer.
 The three of us assassinatedthe Third Hoshikage!
 It was the quickest wayto save the village.
 Say what?!
 You guys are the traitors!
 – Right! 					– Right! Right!
 No, don’t get the wrong idea.
 We just helped a little.
 Idiot. That’ll be an acknowledgement!
 Akahoshi!
 We will not acknowledge youas leader of the village.
 Justice is not with you anymore.
 It is the children who possess the heartsthat truly care about the village.
 Everyone! Let us rise togetherwith those children
 for the sake of the village.
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 We’re sorry, children.
 We were completely taken inby Akahoshi’s fast-talk.
 As of now, we’ll fight with you!
 Give it up, Akahoshi.
 We’ve lost!
 Shut up! I haven’t lost.
 Mizura!
 Hokuto… Live for me…
 Mizura!
 Akahoshi, we won’t let you do asyou please anymore!
 I won’t let you do somethinglike go against me!
 Have you gone mad?!
 Akahoshi, you’ve lost!
 Give in to justice with good grace!
 I won’t lose!
 The star is now…in my hands!
 The star?!
 I will now becomethe Fourth Hoshikage!
 Power… I’m starting to brimwith power.
 I do not need any training.
 I could have become one withthe star if I’d done this from the start..
 What…What’s this?
 What’s that?!
 Byakugan.
 Massive Chakra from the star haspoured into his Chakra Network
 and is causing it to go out of control.
 Hokuto!
 I can’t take it anymore!Neji! Hey, Neji!
 Don’t… Naruto…
 No matter what you say,I’ll kick that Akahoshi jerk’s butt!
 You jerk. I won’t be responsible.
 Right. Just say that I butt in on my own.
 L-Lord Akahoshi.
 Akahoshi!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!

 You jerk.

 Despite having been assigneda mission to protect the star,
 to think you’d smashthe all-important star…
 You didn’t just fail to completethe mission!
 The compensation feewill be massive.
 But Grandma, I had no other choice!
 It’s my fault as the leader fornot being able to stop him.
 I’m responsible as well!
 Right. I also…
 Well, that’d be a matterunder normal circumstances.
 We haven’t received complaintsfrom the Star Village
 with regard to the incident ofthe star being smashed.
 In fact, the culprit of this incident
 was the client Akahoshi,the deputy Hoshikage.
 So the mission itself is forgotten!
 Come to think of it,what happened to him?
 It seems the three,
 the main culprit Akahoshi andaccomplices Yotaka and Shisou,
 will be punished severelyby Hidden Star Village!
 That’s good! Now the Star Villagewill be peaceful.
 Come in.
 Lady Tsunade, all the Genin fromthe Star Village have been examined.
 And…?
 If they all receive proper treatment,they will return to good health.
 Hey, what about Mizura?
 Yes. That boy will also be fine.
 Yes! So, where’s everyone?
 They’ve completed their examinationsand are heading for their quarters.
 Hey, Naruto! The lecture isn’t…
 He never changes.
 Hey, guys.
 That’s great! Get better, Mizura.
 Right!
 I won’t lose to you.
 Huh, what?!
 I’ll become Hoshikage before you!
 Even without the power of the star,
 I’ll make the Village Hidden in the Starsinto a most powerful Ninja village!
 Say what?
 No way will I lose!I’ll become Hokage before you!
 Shut up. I’ll be first.
 I’ll be first, believe it!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 There is no way that I alone canlose in a place like this!
 Guy Sensei…please allow it.
 It is now…
 A time to carry through and protectone’s own Way of the Ninja!
 The Fifth Gate: A Splendid Ninja is Born
 The color of his body changed…!
 He’s red…?!
 What’s up with him...?!
 He’s opened the third gate,the Gate of Life…
 He’s going to make his move!
 No, not yet!
 What?!
 And also,
 the fourth gate,the Gate of Pain…open!
 What an incredible guy…
 It’s not as though effort alonecan make this happen…
 That boy…
 is he in fact a genius…?
 He’s fast!
 Gaara!
 Where are they?!
 He’s above!
 But we can’t find Lee!
 Where?!
 The sand isn’t keeping up at all!
 So it’s the Sand Armor again…?
 Then how’s this?!
 What…?!
 This Sand Armor is…
 being peeled away…!
 You’re a stubborn one.
 Since it comes to this…
 The muscles have torn…
 Is that really Lee…?
 When did he become like this…?
 This is the end!
 The Fifth Gate of Closing…open!
 I can’t defend myself…
 Is this the movement ofa human being?!
 Neji…
 This technique is my ace inthe hole to take you down…
 but I will specially show it to you!
 Huh?!
 The Sand Shield can’t keep up!
 Most of the armor has also been peeled off…
 He’s done for!
 W-Wow!
 Hidden Lotus… In other words...
 it’s a high-speed continuousTaijutsu that can’t even be touched!
 The answer to take Neji down isthat high speed combination…
 There is no way thatthe sand can keep up!
 This technique will be the last!
 Hidden Lotus!
 I can’t see anything, it’s too fast…
 That’s impossible…
 The gourd has turned to sand…?
 He’s done it this time!
 Gaara!
 Lee…
 Oh!
 What’s…that?
 He protects himself…
 using a gourd made of sand?!
 That technique is…!
 Sand Coffin!
 No way!
 He got hit by the Hidden Lotus
 and is still able to bringforth a technique…!
 Sand Coffin!
 I just can not lose in a place like this…
 I want to…
 my Way of the Ninja…
 Oh no!
 Die!
 Why…?
 Why…save him?
 He’s…
 I’m all right!
 I’m strong so…
 The Chunin Exam…
 Guy Sensei, please watchme with a smile...
 I’d like to prove that I couldbecome a respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t use Ninjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 He is...
 an important subordinatewhom I care for!
 A subordinate…whom I care for...?
 Those words are definitelynot understandable to Gaara…
 I quit…
 He quit…?
 The moment Guy jumped in,Lee lost.
 The winner…
 Gaa-!
 – Wha…? 					– Huh?
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Wha--?!
 That’s impossible…
 Having opened the fifth gate…
 And his hand and feet are crushed…
 There’s no way he shouldbe able to stand…!
 Lee…
 It’s all right.
 It’s over!
 You’re in no condition to stand…!
 Lee…
 Y-You…
 You are…
 Even after havinglost consciousness…
 You still want to prove yourown Way of the Ninja…?
 So he had already…
 lost consciousness…
 Lee...
 You’re already…
 a respectable Ninja…!
 The winner…
 Gaara.
 Lee!
 Stop!
 Even if you went downwhat could you do?
 Your words of encouragementwould only make him feel worse.
 There’s no way he couldhave beaten Gaara…
 He was faced with a tougher battlethan we thought…
 That Naruto…
 Bushy Brow lostto a guy like this…!
 Medics, please hurry.
 Bushy Brow…
 Lee…
 You are the Jonin in charge of him,aren’t you?
 Y-Yes.
 Please come with mefor a minute.
 Careful…
 Don’t shake him.
 There is faint breathing…
 but because of comminuted fracturesand muscle tears to his entire body,
 recovery will likely to takequite some time…
 If that was all, it wouldn’t be so bad, but…
 The damage to the left armand leg which received the attack is severe…
 It’s too severe…
 Oh…!
 I don’t want to say this,
 but he won't be able to...live as a Shinobi again.
 T-That…
 that can’t be true…
 I will take Bushy Brow down.Believe it!
 It is not you whom I want to fight,it’s Uchiha!
 You…!
 Naruto, I get where you'recoming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be doneofficially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted geniusthrough sheer effort…
 Wouldn't that make foran exciting main battle?
 Though, I am probably going to be the one fighting Neji…
 Lee…
 I didn’t want to think... that you’d lose.
 I wanted to let you fulfill…
 your Way of the Ninja!
 Yay!
 I finally mastered it!
 Yahoo!
 This technique…
 after all, only Lee managed to master…
 Okay, you became Genin from today.
 I want to hear what it isyou all are aiming for!
 I-I’d like to prove that I can becomea respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t useNinjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 Please forgive me for not…
 stopping it...!
 Lee…
 It’s not true…it’s not true.
 After hearing that,what should Bushy Brow do…?!
 This guy…
 He said the failure would takedown a genius with effort…!
 Isn’t there something thatcan be done?!
 Calm down, Naruto.
 B-But…Kakashi Sensei!
 He kept saying he wantedto battle Sasuke and Neji!
 Perhaps…that led to his ruin.
 To fulfill that dream…
 the boy even used a self-sacrificingforbidden technique to try to win!
 The result is what you see…
 That boy…
 Sasuke and Neji…
 and you…
 he sacrificed himself toa promise he never spoke of.
 He risked his life…
 so that he might havea chance to battle you guys…
 Don't forget that…
 I wonder if Lee…
 will be all right…?
 Lee…
 You didn’t realize it even at the end…
 Heaven does not allow it.
 One who tries to move aheadwhile achieving victory
 through a method like dyingupon each other’s swords.
 So it ended without incident…
 Welcome back Gaara.
 Guy…
 Well…
 I spoke self-importantly earlier but…
 I’ve thought about it andhad I been in your position…
 I probably... wouldn’t havebeen able to stop him.
 Guy.
 We’re in the way of thenext tournament…let’s go up.
 All right…
 Then, the tenth and final round is next,both contestants come forward!
 So it’s finally my turn…
 I’m gonna win and havesome barbecued beef!
 In any case, I need to last untilthe main tournament and battle Sasuke.
 Or I will not have met your expectations,Lord Orochimaru…
 I can almost see through it…
 The reason that you went to the troubleof getting to Sasuke before us and...
 putting a Curse Mark on himwithout killing him…
 In other words,
 we were the guinea pigs to measureSasuke’s abilities during the examinations.
 What you wanted isn’t Sasuke’s life,but Sasuke himself…
 I was also taken for a fool…
 Now, let the tenth round begin.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Sakura!
 Do you know whereKakashi Sensei is?
 Naruto...
 I’m gonna have him watchmy training until the main tournament.
 Kakashi Sensei is probably with Sasuke.
 What’s up with you, Sakura?You seem a little down.
 No, nothing…
 It’s just that I get this bad feeling…

 Brothers:                     Distance Among the Uchiha
 Big Brother…I’ll get off.
 Don’t push it…
 Okay…
 Oh…
 What’s up?
 This is the place…where Father works, right?
 Yeah…The headquartersof the Leaf Police Force.
 I was curious about it from before,
 but why’s the Uchiha Clan creston the Police Force mark?
 Oh… so you noticed, huh?
 Of course…
 Yeah…Let me see…To put it simply…
 it seems the previous generationsof the Uchiha Clan
 set up and established the Police Force.
 So they used their own crest forthe symbol mark of this organization.
 From olden times,the Uchiha Clan has always been
 in charge of protectingthe public and the peace of this village.
 The Uchiha crest isa testament to the proud clan.
 The Uchiha Clan has gotten small now.
 But even now, nearly all membersbelong to this first force here.
 and contribute to maintainingpeace in the village.
 Only even more exceptional Shinobican crack down on the crimes
 committed by Shinobi, so…
 Sure enough, father’s awesome!
 Leaf Police Force		Are you going to enter		the Police Force, too?
 Well…I’m not sure…
 Why not?!
 When I grow up, I’m also goingto enter the Police Force, so!
 Father’s also coming totomorrow’s entrance ceremony.
 It’s the first step to my dream.
 That’s right.
 You’re late…What were you doing?
 Father…
 I have something to talk to you about.Come quickly.
 That's my boy.
 You’ve come this far just half a yearafter being promoted to Chunin.
 About tomorrow’s special mission…
 I’ve decided to go with you, too.
 Tomorrow?
 If you complete this mission, Itachi…
 your entrance intothe Anbu Black Ops is almost assured!
 You understand, right?
 You don’t have to be so worried.More importantly…
 Umm… Father…
 Tomorrow’s my…
 Tomorrow’s mission will bea very important mission not just for you,
 but for the Uchiha Clan!
 I’m quitting tomorrow’s mission, after all.
 What’re you doing talking insanity?!
 You should know how importanta day tomorrow is!
 I’m going to Sasuke’s Academyentrance ceremony tomorrow…
 The general rule is for relativesto attend the Academy entrance ceremony.
 There was the notice, right… Father?
 I get it already.
 I’ll go to the Academy…
 Your left leg…
 Be sure to ice it.
 Right…
 Big Brother… He’s so distant…
 Entrance Ceremony
 Everyone! Congratulationson your entrance!
 From here on, please work very hardtowards striving for the Shinobi path.
 And I’d like you to bring further prosperityto the Hidden Village in the Leaf.
 Gee… I rememberthe time when Itachi entered.
 Just what I’d expect from his brother.
 Thank you for your help with both boys.
 Oh, it’s nothing like that.
 The first prodigy since the beginningof the Academy…
 There were no studentsas exceptional as that boy.
 That’s a bit too much praise.
 Not at all…
 I’m hopeful for you, too.
 Become a fine Shinobilike your big brother.
 Yes.
 Hey…That’s Uchiha, right?
 Yeah.
 I wonder…if he’s awesome, too.
 Hmm…Must be.
 Recess at last! What a drag.I’m still not used to this place…
 You want some too, Shikamaru?
 I mean, all of your recesseshave become meal times.
 That’s my boy…
 I’ve great confidenceyou’ll make it great in Anbu.
 This won’t do!
 Won’t do!
 I’ve got a long way…to go…
 Really…
 You should rest your bodyon your days off at least.
 You don’t have to push it.
 I heard…that Big Brother graduatedfrom the Academy in just one year.
 The times are different, then and now.
 Besides, that kid is a bit special, so…
 That’s my boy…
 Now, I’m going to hand outthe report cards for the first half.
 Taijutsu: 1st in class and academyNinjutsu: 1st in class and academy		lndividual rank: 1st in class and academy		Team rank: 1st in class and academy
 Do a fine job in this vein likeyour big brother.
 Father… I wanted you to say,“That’s my boy,” to me…
 What did you say?
 What do you mean you can’t participatein the assembly tomorrow?!
 You don’t understand your own position!
 I’m setting out on a mission tomorrow.
 What’re they doing this lateat night with the lights off?
 What mission?!
 I can’t say…lt’s a top secret mission.
 Itachi…You also have the roleof the pipe which connects the clan
 with the keystone of the village.
 You know that, don’t you?
 Yeah…
 Keep that well in mind!And come to tomorrow’s assembly!
 Sasuke…
 Get to bed afteryou’ve gone to the bathroom.
 Right…
 What’re you doing hanging aroundthis late at night?
 Get to bed!
 Okay.
 Report Card
 Father only thinks about you, Big Brother…
 Am I loathsome to you?
 It’s okay.
 It’s logical for Shinobi to beill-thought of by people, so…
 That's not how I feel…
 Brother's right.I really do…think ill of him…
 Excellence is not easy at all.
 If you have power,you become alienated and also arrogant.
 Even if you’re covetedand sought after at first.
 But, we only have each otherfor siblings.
 I will continue to exist with youas a wall you must get over…
 Even if I’m ill-thought of…That’s what a big brother is.
 Is Itachi home?!
 I have something totalk to you about. Come out!
 Why’s everyone gathered here?
 There are two people who didn’t cometo yesterday’s assembly.
 Why didn’t you come?!
 He didn’t go to the assembly Fatherwas talking about last night, after all.
 I understand that when you enter Anbu,
 you get roped into varioustroublesome things.
 Your father also said somethinglike that in your defense.
 But for us, we don’t intendto treat you special.
 Understood. I shall be careful next time.
 Now I’m going to haveto ask you to leave.
 Right… But before that,there’s a little more I want to ask you…
 It’s about Shisui Uchiha who threw himselfinto the Nakano River to kill himself.
 Threw himself?!
 The other person who didn’t cometo the assembly is that Shisui.
 As I recall, you adored himlike a real older brother.
 I see… I hadn’t seen him at all recently.
 That’s too bad.
 And we the Police Force have decidedto launch an all-out investigation.
 Investigation?!
 This is the will Shisui wrote.
 The analysis of the handwritinghas been completed.
 No mistake, he did indeed write it.
 If there are no murder leads,then what’s the investigation?
 It’d be easy for a person who can useSharingan to copy handwriting, you see…
 The most adept Uchiha.
 The man feared as Shisui,“the Instantaneous Man.”
 He was a man who would takethe lead no matter what the mission
 if it was for the sake of the clan.
 It’s tough to think that
 such a man would leave somethinglike this and kill himself.
 You shouldn’t judge people…only on looks and speculation.
 For the time being,I leave the will with you.
 Take that and you request cooperationin the investigation from Anbu Black Ops.
 Understood…
 I hope we get a lead.
 Also, we have a different routeto Anbu Black Ops.
 We’ll know right away if you do somethinglike crushing the investigation request.
 Why don’t you just come right outand say it?
 You suspect me, right?
 Yeah. That’s right, you little punk…
 Listen up, Itachi.
 Just try doing somethinglike betraying the clan and…
 it’ll cost you!
 I told you before.
 You shouldn’t judge people…only on looks and speculation.
 It’s because you take the liberty tojudge me as patient and take me lightly.
 Clan…Clan…
 You measure incorrectlythe size of your own vessels
 and don’t know the depth of mine,so you grovel there…
 I’ve never seen him like this…
 Shisui…was monitoring you recently…
 Half a year after entering Anbu…
 the strangeness of your behaviorcouldn’t be overlooked.
 What the hell are you thinking?
 Fixated on the organization,
 fixated on the clan,fixated on the name.
 It’s a dreadful thing that constrains oneselfand labels one’s own vessel.
 And it’s a foolish thing…
 that fear and hate…what one has never seen or known…
 Stop, Itachi!
 What the hell’s the matterwith you?!
 Itachi…You’ve been a little strange lately.
 I’m not strange at all.
 I’m carrying out my own role…That’s it.
 Then why didn’t you come last night?
 In order to elevate myself higher…
 What’re you talking about…?
 My vessel is dismayedat this foolish clan!
 From olden times,the Uchiha Clan has all along
 been in charge protectingthe peace of this village.
 The Uchiha crest is a testamentto the proud clan.
 That’s my boy…
 I’ve great confidenceyou’ll do great in Anbu Black Ops.
 Because you're fixatedon insignificant things like clans…
 you lose sight of what’s truly important.
 True change cannot be made if stuckwithin the restrictions of regulations,
 and constrained predictionsand imagination…
 Saying such arrogant things!
 Enough! You’ll be imprisonedif you say any more foolish nonsense.
 Excellence is not easy at all.
 If you have power,you become alienated and also arrogant…
 even if you’re covetedand sought after at first…
 Why… Big Brother…?
 What do you say?!
 I can’t tolerate it anymore…Captain, order imprisonment!
 Big Brother! Stop it already!
 I’m not the one who killed Shisui.
 But I apologize formy numerous slips of the tongue.
 I’m very sorry…
 Recently, it seems he’s been upto his ears in Anbu Black Ops missions
 and was a little tired…
 Captain!
 The Anbu Black Ops is a forceunder the direct control of Lord Hokage…
 Even we the Police Force can’t arrest him,if we don’t have an arrest warrant.
 And as for Itachi…
 I will take the responsibilityand monitor him.
 Please…
 Understood…
 With this, you’ve woken up, right?
 We had a hindrance back at that time…
 But it won’t be like that this time.
 I’ll show you…the true power of Sharingan.
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Give me all you've got,Naruto.
 Or is this all you've got?
 You were talking impudentlyabout your Way of Ninja
 and this is all you've got?
 You've gotta be kidding! Right now,you're not even worth beating!

 What?
 Gaara Sensei.
 Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.
 What?
 Darn it.
 Did you see that? This is the Dragon Eye:Fang Release: Dark Sword.
 You’re just a kid!
 I see.
 It’s an adjustable sword with daggers
 connected by an iron wiregoing through the center.
 Like a Bamboo Snake?How nostalgic.
 I used one a lot with puppet gameswhen I was a kid.
 It can look like a living snakedepending on how it’s controlled.
 But there’s no pointonce it’s been identified.
 Though we both use Puppets,compared to mine, it’s just a kid’s toy.
 Go, Gaara.
 Can I leave it to you?
 Yeah. I don’t need your help for this.I’ll catch up right away.
 I’m counting on you.
 Now, bring it on. I’ll play with you.
 What’re you doing acting tough?
 You’ll die if you take me lightly!
 That goes for you!
 Then die, Kabuki makeup jerk!
 Here I go.
 That’s no good.
 Come on, that was too easy.
 Too bad. This swordisn’t just an adjustable sword.
 The sword itself amplifies Chakrain response to my Chakra
 and changes into the form of a dragon.
 Gaara, I’m sorry.This might take a little time.
 Suiko, you ambush him here.
 Draw him intothe Reverse Scale Position. Got it?
 Yeah…
 You won’t get through here.
 Gaara, fight me.
 Very well.
 Bring it.
 Hey, Shikamaru. How long are wegoing to stay like this?
 Shut up. There are many difficultieswith ambushes.
 Right now, Shino, Neji and Hinataare taking on those difficulties for us.
 What? They are?
 Did you find them?
 Byakugan!
 In that direction, right?
 Byakugan!
 Got it. There are three battle areas.
 It’s the scent bag ofthe female Parasitic Insects.
 With this, the insects will find youno matter where you go.
 Right. I’m counting on you, Shino.
 Then, we’ll be going on ahead.
 Be careful!
 Oh, information has arrived.
 I was getting sick of waiting!
 All right, I’m counting on you guys.
 This is bad.lt’s already begun.
 All right, Kiba and Choji,you take the western forest.
 Ino and I will take the northeastern hills.
 Naruto and Lee, you takethe northwestern forest.
 We’ll take on back-upin two-man cells.
 Now then, let’s beginthe favor-returning operation.
 – Right. 					– Right.
 I was waiting for this time!
 Scatter.
 What is it?
 Hold up.
 If the guys who are fleeing will take onpursuers with One Shinobi, One Kill,
 the battle area not beinga straight line means…
 Could it be a Barrier?
 What?
 Just to be safe.
 That should do it. Let’s go.
 Right.
 Now, there’s nowhere left to hide.What will you do?
 To think she’d evade all of my attacks.
 Since it’s come to this, I’ve just got touse that technique!
 Wind Style: Sea Dragon!
 What’s that? Nothing’s happening.
 How pitiful. It seems the winddoesn’t like you.
 I don’t know about that.
 The wind is my friend.
 This battle is just starting.
 Wind Reversal!
 Die!
 Darn it! Hey, let go!
 Done already? I thoughtwe could play a little more…
 That’s the spirit!
 What kind of toy is it this time?
 That’s funny. You think you candefeat me with junk like this?
 The junk is your sword.
 What?! A three-headed dragon!
 You’re just quick to escape, eh?
 Darn it.
 Sure enough,Crow is at a disadvantage
 unless teamed up with Black Ant.
 Not bad, Gaara of the desert.
 How much Chakra is built upin that sand?
 You want to test that out?
 However…
 It’ll be in exchange for your life.
 Sand Coffin!
 Impossible.
 That’s a nice sand bath.
 You, the sand’s Chakra…
 Exactly. This armor sucks up Chakra.
 Aw, is this good night?
 Just sleep as is! For all eternity!!
 What?!
 That was a close shave,
 but Shadow Possession Jutsuwas a success!
 Die already!
 Uh, oh!
 What?
 You guys.
 Who are you?
 Who are you guys?
 – An ally of the Sand.– An ally of the Sand.
 – Leaf Shinobi.– Leaf Shinobi
 Believe it!
 He’s not here!
 – They're further ahead.– Right!
 Guys, fight as much as you want.
 I don’t see any Chakra abnormalitiesin the basin…
 There’s no Barrier.
 Good luck, guys.
 I’ll protect you.
 Gaara Sensei.
 Just wait, Gaara!
 We’ll return the favor, no matter what.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Damn it.This was their aim from the start.
 To think they would take advantageof the terrain.
 Damn. At this rate,Gaara will be in danger.
 That’s been said,we can’t move from here.
 Please hurry, Naruto, Lee.
 You two are the only oneswho can help Gaara now.

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 He's late.
 Naruto!
 Stay still.
 Why's it that onlyour squad's teacher is late?
 The other squads have gone offsomewhere with their new teachers,
 and Iruka Sensei's also left.
 Don't look at me.
 Hey, what're you doing, Naruto?!
 Hey!
 It'll be his fault because he's late.
 Man! You're asking for it!
 I like stuff like this!
 A Jonin wouldn't get caughtin such a weak booby trap.
 That's right. You're such an idiot...!
 I got him, I got him...
 I-I'm sorry, sir.
 I tried to stop him,but Naruto did it on his own...
 It's all good.
 Get real.ls he really a Jonin?
 How can I put this?
 As for my first impressionof you guys...?
 Well, I hate you.
 Pass or Fail: Survival Test
 Let's see.
 First off, let me haveyou guys introduce yourselves.
 Introduce ourselves...
 What should we say?
 Your likes, dislikes, your future dream,hobbies, things like that!
 Hey!  Before that, please tell usabout yourself.
 Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.
 I don't feel like telling youguys about my likes and dislikes.
 I've never really thoughtabout my future dream...
 As for my hobbies, I have many.
 In the end,isn't all we know his name?
 Yeah.
 Next is you guys.
 Let's start with you.
 My name's Naruto Uzumaki!
 I like instant ramen,
 but what I like even moreis the ramen from Ichiraku
 that Iruka Sensei treats me to.
 What I dislike is the three minutes
 after pouring hot waterin the instant ramen.
 My hobby is eating andcomparing ramen!
 And my future dream...
 is to surpass the Hokage!
 And so I'm going to getthe entire village
 to acknowledge my existence!
 I see...
 this kid's grown up inan interesting way.
 Okay, next.
 I'm Sakura Haruno.
 What I like... I mean, who I like is...
 And, my hobby is, 					I mean...
 My future dream is...
 And?What about your dislikes?
 Naruto!
 Girls at her age are probablymore interested in love
 than the Ninja Arts.
 And lastly.
 My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.
 I have lots of dislikes,but no likes in particular.
 Oh...
 And...
 I don't feel like summing upmy ambition as just a dream
 but I do have an ambition!
 The ambition to restore my clanand without fail...
 to kill a certain man!
 He doesn't...
 mean me, does he?
 Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.
 I knew it...
 Good!
 The three of you are very distinctiveand interesting!
 We'll have a mission tomorrow!
 Yes, sir! What kind of mission?
 First, we'll do what we can dowith just four people.
 What-what-what?!
 A survival exercise.
 Survival exercise?
 Why are we doing an exercise
 even though this is supposedto be a mission?
 We've had more than our shareof exercises in the Academy!
 This is no simple exercise.
 Then... then what kind of exercise is it?
 Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?
 Uh, well, if I tell you,I know you'll grow disenchanted.
 What?
 Of the twenty-seven graduates,
 only nine will be recognizedas junior ninjas.
 The remaining eighteen willbe sent back to the Academy.
 In other words, this exerciseis an extremely difficult test
 with a failure rate of 66% or higher!
 See, see?
 You got disenchanted!
 That's crazy!
 To have suffered that much!
 T-Then, what wasthe graduation test for?
 Oh, that.
 It was just to select those who havethe potential of becoming Genin.
 Whaaaat?!
 Well, that's the way it is.
 I'll be determining whetheryou pass or fail.
 Bring your complete setof Ninja tools!
 We meet at five in the morning.
 N-No way am I going to bedropped now!
 I've got to have my strengthrecognized for real.
 I'll be separated from Sasukeif I fail this test.
 This is an exercise of love!
 Okay! You're dismissed.
 Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.
 You'll throw up.
 Morning.
 Hi, folks. Good morning!
 You're late!
 Well, a black cat crossedmy path, you see.
 Ahem! Oh well...
 Okay, it's set for 12:00!
 Today's assignment is to takethese bells away from me by noon.
 Those who can't do it won't get lunch.
 They'll be tied to that...
 and I'll eat my lunchbefore your very eyes.
 So that was the point...
 for us not to eat breakfast...
 But, hold on.
 Why are there only two bells?
 There are only two,so at the very least,
 one will have togo to the logs.
 That person will be disqualifiedfor failing the mission...
 and will return to the Academy.
 It might be one personat the very least,
 or it could be all three of you.
 You can use your Shuriken.
 You won't be able to take the bellsunless you come with the intent to kill me.
 But, that's dangerous, sir!
 Y-Yeah, that's right!
 You couldn't even evadea chalkboard eraser!
 In this world,
 those who aren't skilled enoughtend to complain more.
 Well, just ignore the loser...
 Begin when I givethe ""ready-go"" signal.
 Loser, loser, loser.
 Don't be so hasty.I didn't say start, yet.
 No way...!
 I didn't see him at all.
 So this is a Jonin.
 But, that's fine.
 At least you came with the intent to kill me.
 How can I put this...?
 I feel like I'm finally starting...
 to like you guys.
 We're going to start.
 Ready... start!
 What do you want to know?
 I didn't think you justcame here to drink tea.
 The Jonin in Naruto and company'sGroup Seven...
 What kind of teacher is he?ls he strict?
 You mean Kakashi?Does he concern you?
 I heard a rumor that concerns me.
 What's this?
 It's a pass-fail list ofthe junior ninjas
 Kakashi has beenin charge of up until now.
 Let me have a look.
 T-This is...!
 Fundamentally, ninja must masktheir presence and hide.
 Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...
 Alright! Let's face offfair and square!
 Oh?
 That goof.
 Say, aren't you a bitoff kilter?
 What's off kilteris your hairstyle!
 I'll teach you the firstShinobi Battle Jutsu...
 Taijutsu.
 Taijutsu...?
 That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...
 That being said...he's going to use weapons?
 Make-Out Paradise
 What's the matter?
 Why don't you come at me?
 But hey... what's with the book?
 Why do you ask...?
 It's because I was curiousabout what happens next.
 Don't worry.
 With you guys as opponents,
 it makes no differenceif I'm reading or not.
 I'm going to rip you apart!
 Darn! This time a spin kick!
 Man!
 Wha--?!
 Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take themfrom behind multiple times, fool.
 The way his hands are positioned...
 Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!
 No way!
 With Naruto as his opponent,
 that's too strong a Ninjutsuno matter how you look at it.
 That Sign...lt's a fire-style skill.
 That idiot teacher's doing morethan just running around?
 Naruto, get out of there quick!
 You'll die!
 Too late.
 Leaf Village Secret!Ultimate Taijutsu!
 One Thousand Years of Death!
 Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.
 Those two are idiots.
 Alright...
 Even so, isn't that against the rules?
 What're we supposed to doabout his strength?
 Darn it!
 It wasn't supposed to belike this.
 It... can't be!
 This is more than just a rumor.
 Kakashi's test mightbe a bit difficult...
 Even so, this means absolutelyno one has passed...!
 That's right...
 Kakashi has never had someone pass.
 They have all...
 been annihilated...
 What's the matter?
 You won't get lunch if you can'ttake the bell by noon.
 I know that, I say.
 You're not very energetic,
 considering you said thatyou'd surpass the Hokage.
 Darn it! Darn it!I can fight even if I'm hungry.
 I didn't even have dinner last night.
 I shouldn't have gone on a diet.
 I just got a bit careless earlier!
 Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...
 But... I've got to take the bell,no matter what.
 No matter what...
 I'm... not...
 turning back now!
 I'm going to become a Ninja!
 Security is your greatest enemy!
 Now for my favoriteMulti-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Seven... Narutos?
 What? They're not just images?
 Are they all real?The real thing?
 Not the clone,but the shadow clone, eh.
 If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,I'll kill you!
 Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
 Those aren't just imagesbut actual clones!
 That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
 It's the forbidden Jutsuthat did in Mizuki.
 Judging from your ability,
 that Jutsu should havea one-minute limit.
 Even if you talk trash,
 Naruto is Narutoafter all is said and done...
 You still can't beat me with that skill.
 W-What?! Behind me?!
 Ninja shouldn't letthe enemy take them from behind.
 Right, Kakashi Sensei?
 Using the Shadow Clone,
 I had one of them come up
 from the bottom of the riverand sneak behind you!
 Here's one for that attackon my butt earlier!
 Naruto, not bad!
 So... a diversionary tactic, eh?
 Now... allow me to punch you!
 What?!
 The one who got punched was...
 Naruto?
 Ouch!
 You...!
 You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!
 You used the Transformation Jutsuto change yourself, didn't you?!
 It's you!
 You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.
 You smell like Kakashi Sensei!
 The smell of an old guy!
 Why you--!
 Hey! For the time being,let's try undoing the Jutsu.
 If we do that,only the two will remain... so...
 You should've realized that sooner,you idiot!
 You're me, you idiot!Just undo the Jutsu!
 Naruto...
 You're embarrassing to watch...
 That was the Substitution Jutsu,you fool.
 Essentially, it's a skill usedto quickly switch one's own body
 with an object or animal.
 This makes your enemy thinkyou're being attacked,
 but then you strike duringtheir unguarded moment.
 After letting himself get caughtby the real Naruto,
 the Jonin fool switched bodieswith one of the clone Narutos.
 Not only did he make Narutothink he'd been nailed...
 he used Naruto's own attack on him.
 A bell?!
 You really must have been in a hurry.
 You've dropped a bell!
 What the heck is this?!
 Of course it's a trap...
 H-H-Hey!
 That jonin doesn't lower his guardeven when he's fighting Naruto.
 The bell!
 You have to think when using Jutsu.
 They can be used against you.
 Also...
 ...don't get caught inan obvious trap, you fool.
 A Ninja must seethrough deception!
 I know that, I say!
 You know, I'm telling youbecause you don't get it.
 Listen up!
 Your movements are wasteful.
 Now!
 He finally dropped his guard!
 You're so...
 No way!
 You jerk Sasuke!
 You're overdoing it!
 Darn it!
 At this rate, there's no wayI can beat Kakashi Sensei.
 But if I don't take the bell...
 I won't get lunch...
 No... I'll fail the test!
 He says a Ninja must seethrough deception,
 but I have no idea what that means.
 How in the world can I takethe bell back
 from Kakashi Sensei?!

163,"I want to try and gatherthe unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Is this really Moso’s house?
 Here he’s a superintendant officer,
 so I thought it’d be a more luxuriousbuilding with gold folding screens.
 Your voices are too loud.
 Lord Moso is a magnificent personwith no self-interests.
 So he lives frugally.
 But you know, he’s an old man
 who’s the second most important guyin the land next to the feudal lord, right?
 He smacks of being really poor.
 Naruto!
 Well well, how shameful of meto present such a poor residence.
 Lord Moso.
 What?!
 This old man like fromsome dumpling shop?
 I’m an old man froma dumpling shop?
 Geez, unbelievable!
 Idiot!
 What’re you doing, Neji?!
 Well, make yourselves comfortable.
 So you are Ninja who came fromthe Village Hidden in Leaves?
 From the right,this is Naruto, Neji and Tenten.
 I hear you encounteredthe Cursed Warrior that appeared
 in Lord Komei’s residence last night.
 Yes.
 So, how did it go?
 Did you figure out the true identityof the Cursed Warrior?
 Yeah, it’s a real ghost.
 Oh, a ghost, huh?
 Don’t be jumping to conclusionson your own.
 But he appears all of a suddenand flies around.
 Yeah, and on top of that,the inside of his armor was empty.
 No matter how bizarre the thing,there’s always a trick.
 I’ll pin down the true identity without fail.
 That is encouraging…
 We have just changed feudal lordsand the public is still anxious.
 Please eliminate the rumors ofthe Cursed Warrior as soon as possible.
 I beg of you.
 Please!
 Tsurucho Yakitori
 Here are your chicken wings.
 Oh, here we go!
 They look tasty!
 Hot!
 That Moso superintendant officerseems like a good guy.
 Yes. It was also Lord Mosowho came to my rescue
 and selected me to be a page.
 The son of the feudal lord succeeds him
 and an excellent superintendant officeroffers him tutelage…
 The government appearsto be stable, but…
 Then why is there a strange rumorgoing around
 about the hauntingof the previous feudal lord?
 There’s probably somebody displeased
 with this dramatic replacementof the feudal lord.
 Do you have any idea who it might be?
 Well, it might be Lord Komei, after all.
 Isn't that the name ofthe tactician you were talking about
 who wanted to become the feudal lord?
 Then why did the Cursed Warriorappear in his residence?
 Perhaps to deflect attention.
 That’s it. 					I bet that’s it.
 All right, since it’s come to this,
 if we can nab that old mancalled Komei or whatever
 and quickly get him to own up…
 Guys, let’s get fired up andget going!
 Idiot. We can’t do somethinglike that without proof.
 He is a tactician of this landmore or less, so.
 Oh man, that’s no fun.
 First, I want to meet Lord Sagi,the feudal lord.
 That’s not possible. Lord Sagidoes not like to meet anybody.
 Don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud.Let us meet him, okay?
 You’re a “nipple” friend, right?
 If you’re going to say that,say, “childhood friend.”
 Huh?
 Can we really meet himin a place like this?
 This lake holds fond memoriesfor Lord Sagi.
 And…for me as well.
 In our young days,
 Lord Sagi always played withhis little sister Lady Toki here.
 He might come here around about todaywith his attendants…
 If we’re lucky.
 It’s up to luck, huh?
 It’s Lord Sagi.
 Lord Sagi, we have arrived.
 Thank you.
 Oh wow…So that’s Lord Sagi, huh?
 He’s cute. He is kind of my liking…
 My watch has remained stoppedsince that time.
 Hey, what’s he doing?
 He’s probably reminiscing.
 The only thing that can comfortLord Sagi’s heart
 is his memories with Lady Toki.
 Byakugan.
 Where is it?
 Where’s this bloodthirsty auracoming from?
 It’s not above ground?
 Could it be, underwater…?
 Assassins! Protect Lord Sagi!
 I don’t think so!
 Who the heck are you guys?
 Damn it!I won’t let you get away.
 Wait, Naruto!
 What is it?
 A letter bomb in the water.
 That was a close one.
 If you’d chased after them as is,you would’ve been totally entangled.
 Settle down.
 Lord Sagi!
 Are you all right?!
 Yes, I’m fine.
 Thank goodness!
 Lord Sagi, these three are Ninjafrom the Village Hidden in Leaves…
 They came to investigatethe true identity of the Cursed Warrior.
 That was unnecessary.I bet it was that  Moso’s idea?
 It was all becausehe was worried for your life, Lord Sagi.
 The fact is, if these peoplewere not here now…
 Silence.
 Y-Yes, my lord.
 Hey-hey, do you really not gethow this guy feels?!
 Chishima was seriouslyworried about you.
 Without his passionate friendship,
 the Hidden Leaf Village wouldn’t havetaken action with that low commission fee.
 I am not obliged.
 How bothersome!
 Say what?!
 Friendship is in the past.
 I became a feudal lord andhe is a mere page.
 We are now standing ondifferent surfaces.
 Say that again! I’ll slug the guywho tramples on friendship--!
 Let it go, Naruto.
 What’re you doing?! Let go of me!
 I have to give guys like thisa good thumping!
 You are talking about a feudal lord!
 It would have been betterhad it pierced my throat.
 Go.
 Yes, my lord.
 Jeez, who does he think he is?!
 Jeez, a feudal lord.
 Please forgive him.
 What? You don’t have a problemwith being told off like that?!
 He wasn’t like that in the old days.
 His father and little sisterdied in succession
 and he became cold-hearted.
 So that’s what it was.
 I’m sure the day will come
 when he will turn back intothe kind-hearted Lord Sagi.
 I don’t know about that.
 The Shuriken from before.
 This is an odd shape.
 Hm? Let me have a look.
 Oh!
 Does it look familiar to youor something?
 Y-Yes. There are no Ninjain the Land of Birds.
 But there are guardsmenreceiving special training.
 Is it a weapon those people use?
 Yes.
 Who commands those guardsmen?
 The person who organizes themis Lord Komei the tactician.
 Say what?!
 Komei again.
 Komei must have originally thought tomislead the public with the Cursed Warrior
 and attempted to createa rift between Lord Sagi and Moso.
 But the relationship betweenthe two is tight.
 And by Moso summoning us here,he probably sensed that the day
 was approaching when the truthbehind the incident would be revealed
 and he plottedto assassinate Lord Sagi.
 If we’ve figured out that much,let’s charge on in--!
 Hold your horses, Naruto.
 We have to find more hard evidence.
 Hey, is that how it is?
 Yeah, that’s how it is.
 Neji, look at that.
 No doubt, it’s Komei!
 To think he’d go out without attendants
 even though the Cursed Warriormight appear.
 All right, let’s follow him.
 This is the temple wherethe Cursed Warrior appeared last night.
 Something smells fishy.
 He’s shown up…!
 Byakugan.
 What’s this?!
 There’s no need to waver anymore!
 Hey! Wait.
 I’ve witnessed the true identityof the ghost!
 Who’s there?
 Hey hey, Komei!
 You’re the one responsiblefor controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?
 What?
 H-Hold it!
 Naruto, get down!
 I did it!
 Damn it! No good.
 This thing’s not just a ghost, after all.
 A tornado?
 I can’t see the Cursed Warrior!
 Byakugan.
 A Shuriken Shadow Clone?!
 8 Trigrams Palm Rotation!
 What’re you letting your mind drift for?!
 Sorry… I never thought a ghost coulduse Ninjutsu.
 It’s not a ghost inside the armor.lt’s a Shinobi.
 And quite a wily one at that.
 This is the same shapeas the shuriken from this afternoon.
 He’s an important witness.Take him alive.
 Leave it to me!
 But we can’t take him alive
 if we don’t do something aboutthat tornado.
 Naruto.
 I’m counting on you!
 Right. I’ll try!
 Tenten, use as many weaponsas possible and draw his attention.
 Roger.
 No good. No effect at all.
 That’s fine. Just keep at it.
 Neji…now!
 Gentle Fist Technique,8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
 8 Trigrams 2 Palms.
 4 Palms.
 8 Palms.
 16 Palms.
 32 Palms.
 64 Palms.
 All right, we did it!
 We’ll find out the true identityfor sure this time.
 Show us your real face.
 What’s this?
 It’s empty again.
 This can’t be!
 Lord Komei, we have seized froma storeroom in your residence,
 one suit of white armor alongwith guardsmen Shuriken.
 We would like you to reportto the magistrate’s office
 as a material witness inthe recent Cursed Warrior incident
 as well as the attempted assassinationof Lord Sagi.
 I have no choice.
 Thank you very much.
 With this, Lord Sagi’s heart shouldsettle down somewhat.
 Case closed.
 Still, they were sure prepared.
 Here an hour has barely passedsince contacting Moso.
 At that time…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 There was a human presencein tonight’s Cursed Warrior.
 The presence of someone alive.
 A presence?
 But you said you didn’t feel sucha presence in the first Cursed Warrior.
 Yeah.
 Hey, what does that mean?
 In other words, the two Cursed Warriorare separate beings.
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 How can we go back to the villagewhen there's all this mystery?
 If we're gonna investigate,this has to be it.
 What? Could this black thing be…?
 I get it! We use thisto get through the dark…
 Hey, why did we end upin a place like this?!

 Okay! Let’s go!
 Huh?
 ""Let's go,""with so much energy…
 Don't act like a little kid!
 Oh? You’re in a bad mood.
 Because! Because!lt's in the middle of my training!
 There are three stepsin the training, right?!
 I’m only done with the second step!
 You can do the third stepeven while walking.
 What! Really?!
 A balloon?
 Here!
 What’s this…?An ordinary balloon?
 The first step is “Spin.”The second step is “Power.”
 And finally, the third step is this.
 An Impossible Choice:The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart
 Which one is “this”?!
 Watch me, it looks as ifI am simply holding a balloon…
 You say it “looks as if,”but nothing is really happening.
 Then, I will do the same thingon my left hand.
 Let’s see what’s really happeninginside the balloon.
 Wow!
 The Chakra is randomly spinningand going faster and faster…
 But still, it’s perfectly round…lt’s almost like…
 Like a small typhoon, right?
 What’s happening in your left hand…
 is happening inside that balloonin your right hand, too?
 Yeah! That’s right.
 Cool…
 The balloon isn’t moving at alleven if he’s spinning that much Chakra…
 There’s more power thanthat time the rubber ball popped,
 and it’s spinning a lot more too!
 Listen, in this third step,
 you’ve got to use 100% ofwhat you have learned…
 and retain them.
 In other words, while keepingthe “Spin” and the “Power” at their max,
 imagine creating a single layerwithin the balloon
 and compressing the Chakra within it.
 Got it!
 So, this training is about keeping
 the spin and power that I didin the second step,
 and conversely,trying not to pop a delicate balloon!
 Oh! That’s the most perceptiveyou've been so far!
 Huh?
 But, what’s the point in goingto all the trouble?!
 In short, it means this.
 Watch! It’s like this up untilthe second step of the training.
 Next, after you have masteredthe third step!
 This is what happens!
 If you can keep this small typhoonthe size of your palm,
 the force won’t disperse.
 The spinning gets faster and faster
 and the power getsmore and more compressed.
 And the destructive powerwill reach its max.
 Well, so, that’s that.
 All right! I’ll do this, too!
 Okay, this feels right…
 Now!
 Retain it here!
 Retain…
 Retain…
 No cutting-corners!
 You’ve got to put out 100% spin and power,and retain them.
 You gotta be kidding…
 Unless I can perfectly control all my power,it’s impossible!
 Now I can see it…
 This third step…
 It’s on a totally different levelcompared to the others.
 I told you…
 With an achievement difficulty of Rank A,it’s a super advanced Ninjutsu.
 Well, I’m done explaining!We’ll continue as we go on walking.
 Hey, hey!
 We don’t need to rush so much,until I can properly…
 We have already wasted enough timewaiting for your body to recover.
 There’s no guarantee thatTsunade stays in this town much longer.
 What?!
 But, but…
 It’s not like an old acquaintanceis going to conveniently pop up
 and start talking aboutthe good old times with her…
 Come on, let’s go!
 All right…
 Long time no see…Orochimaru.
 I’d looked for you everywhere.
 What do you want from meafter so long a time?
 You aren’t thinking of talkingabout the old days…?
 Actually, I need to ask youfor a little favor…
 His heartbeat is fast…
 From that complexion,he must have a high fever.
 He must have been fatiguedfor quite some time…
 And that arm…
 Lady Tsunade.
 You must have understood by now.
 Go to someone else,I don’t treat anyone any more.
 That won’t do…
 You must know how seriousthis wound is…
 No one can treat this wound.
 Except for one of the Legendary “Sannin”
 who won her fame asa medical specialist, Princess Tsunade…
 You…
 That arm…it’s not an ordinary wound.
 A special Sealing Jutsu or something…?
 What have you done?
 Well, it just happened…when I killed the Third Hokage.
 You… Really?
 Humph. Don’t look so scary.
 Anything that has a formwill one day decay…
 Same goes for humans.
 You must already know that too.
 For you have let two ofyour most beloved ones die…
 Let two of the most beloved ones die?
 I see… He thinks of terrible things.
 That was a really terrible way to die…
 You!
 Poisoned…
 She’s fast!
 Get out of my way!
 Won’t let you!
 Calm down, Shizune!
 This attendant…is an expert.
 Orochimaru…
 Your personality's been like thisfor a long time.
 And you know my personalityvery well…
 So stop fooling around with me.
 I’ll kill you, bastard!
 She’s powerful…
 And so scary…she definitely must be single.
 Tsunade is impatient and short-tempered…
 Hey Naruto,there’s no time to be falling.
 If we don’t hurry,
 who knows where that shrewwill disappear again.
 Hey you, Pervy Sage!
 That’s no way to speak toa hard-working apprentice!
 Shut up. Tsunade is the first priority now,not you.
 Well, what the heck!
 To have this Pervy Sage comeall the way to meet her…
 Who could this Kunoichi Tsunade be?
 Hope she’s still here…
 We didn’t come here to fight.
 We just want to negotiate with you!
 Negotiate?
 Yes.
 Don’t make me laugh!
 I’ve already told you once.Get out of my sight!
 We can’t do that.
 Get out of my sight.
 You are the only onewho can treat Lord Orochimaru’s arm.
 Get out of my sight.
 We’re not asking you to do it for free.
 Let’s make a deal!
 I’ll count up to five.Leave before I’m done.
 Or else, I’ll make you disappear myself.
 Please calm down.lt won’t be a bad deal for you…
 Five…
 Four…
 Three…
 Two…
 One…
 I’ll resurrect the little brotherand man, both of whom you loved…
 with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.
 Since we haven’t disappeared yet,
 I’m guessing that the deal is made?
 Yes. I do know this young lady…
 Really?
 Yeah.
 To win back the money she lost here,I think she said…
 she was going over there.
 Spin… Power…
 Letting them out to their maxand retain it…
 Hey, kid.
 Hmm?
 Wanna gamble a bit, too?
 Over there? Where is that?
 Hmm?
 See, if the total number of the pipson these dices
 comes out as even numbers,that’s “Cho”
 and if it’s odd, that’s “Han.”
 Shut up! I am training right now,don’t bug me!
 What nonsense!This is a gambling house.
 Instead of that balloon,let’s play with these.
 No way! I don’t have any timeto be playing with those dice!
 Ha, what a boring kid!
 Shut up!
 So…can you tell me where that is?
 Well, you can’t expect things to be freein a gambling house, you know?
 Okay…
 Let’s make a deal.The information will be free if you win…
 And if you lose,I’ll give it to you for 1000 ryo.
 All right!
 So choose, odd or even!
 Okay! Here we go…
 Well, so…since I am exactly 50 years old.
 I’ll go for…even!
 If it’s odd, I win…
 I’ll open it now.
 Oh no! 2 and 5, odd!
 W-What the heck--?!
 1000 ryo…
 Nice, Naruto!
 Looks like I won…
 Darn! It didn’t work again!
 Retain…
 Where shall I look next?
 Geez, she’s nowhere to be found!
 Hm? Me?
 Lotto?
 Kids, grownups, everyone loves it.
 Come and play withthis fun, fun Lotto.
 There’s one that you knowthe result right away.
 Which one do you want?
 Really, you are so much cuterbeing chubby!
 I can’t believe he wonwith just one draw.
 He’s very talented in this…
 though his talent in Jutsuis still immature.
 Well…anyhow…
 Where could have Tsunade gone?
 She couldn’t have gone that farin this short amount of time.
 I guess we’ll have tosearch for her from a higher place.
 If I remember it correctly,this is a castle town.
 If we go up to the castle…
 Naruto! This way!
 Don’t you want to see those two…Tsunade?
 Nawaki…Dan…
 If I treat your arms,what do you intend to do with them?
 Well, I don’t like to lie…
 So, I will tell you the truth.
 Hey, hey! Where is the castle?
 It’s not there…?
 In addition to getting what I want…
 This time, I will completely destroythe Leaf Village!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools
 Hey, enough already!
 Who cares if she is one of the Sannin?!
 Who cares if she isthe legendary Kunoichi?!
 Who cares if she'sthe medical specialist?!
 There's no way I'll acceptthis person as the new Hokage!
 If she belittles the Thirdand Fourth Hokages…
 I don't care if she's the candidateto be the Fifth Hokage!
 I'll kick her butt!

 Wow. There’s a lot of new housesbeing built around here.
 I hear it’s been a bit ofa construction boom recently.
 Seems like a lot of the construction sitesare short-handed
 and they’re hiring carpentersfrom people outside of the country, too.
 Even I know that.
 Oh, Old Man Genno!
 Oh… Naruto.
 Who is he?
 He’s a carpenter from the Land of Sand.
 He likes ramen, and we bumpinto each other at Ichiraku.
 How about we go there after this?
 Yeah!
 Here you go,thanks for waiting!
 Thank you for this meal!
 Thank you.
 Ichiraku’s ramen is the best, after all!
 Isn’t it so? Isn’t it so?
 I’m sorry, but can I have some water…?
 Sure!
 Thank you for this meal!
 That was fast!
 Are you full already?
 No… Not really…
 Then, I’ll give you mine.
 Lucky!
 Hey, Naruto!
 The two of them are always like this.
 They act as if they’re reallygrandfather and grandson.
 Oh come on, Sakura,stop being so harsh.
 There’re lots of other peoplewho complain. Like Grandma Tsunade.
 And there’s Shino, Ino, Kiba,and Kakashi Sensei…
 But I guess you're the harshest, Sakura.
 Come on, Naruto!
 That’s only becauseyou’re always at fault!
 Now, now, Sakura calm down.You hair will turn gray… Ouch!
 – Looks like it’s time– Just leave it and eat up already!
 – I got to business…– But I got nothing left!

 Crisis The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather
 Damn!
 What is it? Fog?
 Well, I guess it doesn’t matter…
 Lady Tsunade.
 I’m sorry to bother youduring your sleep,
 but the man that the Anbu Black Opshave had marked…
 Has made his move?
 He is currently on the run.
 On the run?
 Are you telling me even withthe array of the Anbu Black Ops,
 we still can’t catch him?
 Who is he?
 You must know his identity by now.
 There was nobody inthe recent Bingo Book
 that fit his description,
 but when we checkedan older Bingo Book…
 Genno?
 Genno the Trapper?
 You do know of him?
 He should be quite old by now.
 I hadn’t heard his name in a while,
 so I thought thathe had already retired, but…
 I never would have thought thathe was infiltrating the Leaf Village.
 I guess I can’t fight against old age.
 No… I guess I should say this is justwhat I expect of the Leaf Anbu Black Ops.
 We want you to hand over the thingyou took from the master carpenter’ house.
 You think I would still be holdingonto that thing?
 I've had a long life as a Shinobi…
 I guess it wouldn’t be so bad toclose the curtain at this time.
 Though I regret thatI won’t be able to see
 the end of the Leaf Villagewith my own eyes!
 Paper Bombs!
 Retreat!
 Are you saying that someone
 is planning a huge attackagainst the Leaf Village?!
 That would be the only reasonanyone would want those plans
 besides carpentry purposes.
 Genno’s last words suggest that as well.
 It’s going to take some timeto decipher those plans,
 but it’s too dangerous to depend on that.
 The enemy mayattack us any minute.
 Activate the S-Level EmergencySecurity Alert!
 Leave the least amount ofmen necessary here,
 and all other men are to securethe border!
 Attack anyone who tries to crossthe border!
 Don’t allow them to attack the village,no matter what!
 Such great weather!
 Naruto!
 Oh! Sakura!
 That sound like a big pain in the ass.
 I think you’ll be able to do it.That is why we left you in the village.
 At the very least, is there any waythat we can get more people?
 Under these circumstances,we can’t turn over more people to you.
 They’re the greatest line-up for you,aren’t they?
 The greatest…huh?
 Fog? Last night’s weather didn’t seemlike it was going to be foggy.
 How strange…Was it all a dream?
 Doesn’t it seem likewe’re really low on people?
 That’s what I was thinking, too.
 From the looks of it,
 the village must beunder special security alert.
 What?! For real?!I didn’t notice it!
 You should notice these kinds of things.You’re a Ninja.
 But if we’re in a state of emergency,
 it’s a huge deal for the village,isn’t it?
 Why haven’t they told us anything?
 That’s why Lady Tsunade is calling us.
 Come in.
 Lady Tsunade, I brought Naruto.
 Shikamaru…
 So you must’ve been left out, too.
 Huh? What are you taking about?
 Nothing…
 Oh, hey Shikamaru.About last night’s weird fog…
 Did you see it?
 Stop it.You were just dreaming.
 There was no fog.
 See. I told you…
 That was a smoke screen.
 Smoke screen?
 I’ll explain onceeveryone gets here.
 – Huh? 					– Naruto, Sakura…
 The reason why we left you out of
 the S-Level EmergencySecurity Alert unit
 is because we wanted youto work under Shikamaru
 for a special mission.
 What?
 Well, that’s the case.
 First, I want you to gatherthe people I’m about to name.
 Hey, calm down, Naruto!
 But it’s already past the timewe were supposed to gather!
 Not quite. To be accurate,we still have twenty more seconds.
 Seems like he’s here.
 Oh? Everyone’s already here?
 No matter how you look at it,you’re the last one!
 Everyone’s here now.Then let’s begin.
 I’m sure thatyou all have already noticed.
 The village is currently underthe S-Level Emergency Security Alert.
 It all started when…
 The smoke screen last night, right?
 You guys noticed it?
 Of course.
 The bugs were being noisy…
 Huh? I didn’t notice it.
 You’re always so out of it!
 SAME LEVEL AS CHOJI!		I didn’t notice it either…
 WORSE THAN NARUTO!!		Could it be then that		I’m worse than Naruto?
 Worse than Naruto… Worse thanNaruto… Worse than Naruto…
 So what was that?
 It seemed like something involvingthe Anbu Black Ops.
 So I stayed put…
 Yeah, that’s correct.The Anbu Black Ops were involved.
 Just as I thought…
 It was late last night.
 A man that the Anbu Black Ops hadbeen marking for the past two weeks
 had snuck into the home ofLeaf Village’s top carpenter boss…
 And he stole the plans of our village’simportant facilities from the secret safe.
 Plans…?
 So what’s so bad about that?
 He just stole the plansfor the facilities, right?
 Just stole? You’re so…
 Naruto…
 For example, let’s say the plans forthe fort that surrounds the village
 fell into enemy hands…
 By analyzing those plans in detail,
 the enemy could figure outthe most efficient way
 to break into the village.
 Now let’s say that there wereplans for Lady Tsunade’s mansion.
 If you were to examine those plans,
 you could find out howto get the Lady Tsunade’s room.
 And if the plans were to getinto the hands of an assassin…
 That’s really, really bad.
 Last night’s smoke screen was…
 something that suspect spreadas he was running away.
 I see…
 In the end, Anbu Black Ops cornered himin the Western Forest…
 He killed himself beforethey could get him to talk.
 Unfortunately,when he committed suicide,
 he wasn't in possessionof the plans he had stolen.
 If the plans have already falleninto the hands of the enemy…
 it'd be a re-enactment of the nightmare ofthe Destruction of Leaf Village.
 In order to prevent that from happening
 The S-Level Emergency Security Alertwas deployed this morning.
 So, what is the mission for thoseof us who were left behind?
 Find out the location ofthe stolen plans and bring them back.
 That's our mission.
 It’s like finding a needle ina haystack.
 We just need to investigatethe path he took
 and people he was acquainted with.
 It turns out that the guy was famousfor being a top-level trap technician.
 It’s a huge possibility thathe left traps where the plans are.
 It’s definitely plausible.
 I understand.We’ll follow your instructions.
 I’ll do it.
 Then let’s start the investigation.
 Turns out that the manhad snuck into the village
 a few months ago and workedas a carpenter.
 Th-This guy…
 His name is…Genno
 You’re kidding me.
 There’s no way! Old Man Genno lovedthe ramen at Ichiraku!
 He would never do anything thatwould destroy the Hidden Leaf Village!
 Listen… There’s no way that a guywho’s sneaking in to an enemy village
 would show his bad side.
 He played the part of a good guyto let people’s guard down.
 There is no way that anyonewho loves ramen could be a bad person!
 No. That’s not true Naruto.
 Choji… You tell him.Put some sense into this guy.
 Anyone who loves Ichiraku’s ramencan't be a bad person!
 Choji!
 Gosh, I can’t depend on anybody…
 This is a list of the stolen plans.
 I'm so embarrassedwe lost our important plans…
 I can’t show my face to Lady Tsunade.
 Which construction jobswere Genno involved with?
 None of them.
 But wasn’t he working under you?
 I don’t allow outsiders to workon any construction
 that involves the safety of the village.
 That old man only workedon residential construction.
 Which means…
 There’s little possibility that hesnuck some traps into the construction.
 I think it’s impossible.
 We should check everything,just in case…
 I’m counting on you.
 Lady Hinata, please take care of these.
 Y-Yes!
 I’ll go too.
 Me too.
 I’ve mentioned it earlier,but there is a possibility
 the the plans haven't fallen intothe enemy's hands yet.
 It’s possible that he could have hidden itwhile he was running away.
 And it’s our mission to find that.
 Understood.
 It’s the start of a treasure hunt.I’m depending on you Akamaru.
 Go!
 Ino and Sakura, you guys gocheck the old man's body.
 There might be some clues.
 What?! Us?
 I got it.
 All right! You just want me to go right?!I’ll go!
 Sakura, are you really okay with this?
 I have to be. I’m training to becomea Medical Ninja.
 I can’t be afraid of something like this.
 That might be the case for you, but…
 Now…master carpenter.
 Can you tell us everything you knowabout Old Man Genno?
 The old man came to Leaf Villageabout three months ago…
 He came to my place witha recommendation letter
 from a famous master carpenterfrom the Land of Sand.
 As you may already know,
 there’s a bit of a construction boomin Leaf Village.
 Every place is in need of more people.
 And we needed more hands ourselves,
 so we decided to hire him right away.
 His carpeting skills…were all right, just average.
 I didn’t feel the urge tohire him permanently,
 nor did I feel like I wanted tofire him right away.
 He took his job seriously.
 He was perfect to hirewhen we were short on people.
 But after a while,
 I found out that the recommendation letterhe brought was a fake.
 This is the recommendation letterhe brought.
 And how is this a fake?
 There was a guy who broughta recommendation letter
 from the same master carpentermore than ten years ago.
 I just happen to find thatrecommendation letter,
 so I compared it and I noticedthat the handwriting was different…
 And that recommendation letter?
 It’s over there in that cabinet…
 Oh? Where did I put it?I know I put it here…
 It’s okay if you don’t have it.
 I’m sorry.
 For us, we really didn’t care ifhis recommendation letter was a fake
 as long as he didn’t do anything bad.
 I just thought that I should let thingslike this be known to Lady Tsunade…
 I didn’t think thatthe old man was
 a Shinobi from another countryand that he would steal our plans…
 I still can’t believe it.
 Hey, is it really thatold man’s doing?
 I can’t believe it either.
 There're no signs of traps…
 All right.
 This is where the old man lived, huh?
 He always paid the rent on time.
 He really was quite proper…
 Once in a while he’d come homeafter drinking with his carpenter friends,
 but he would never cause trouble.
 Well, I did predict it,but there are no clues…
 I found it!
 What did you find?
 A special bonito broth, refreshing udonand light broth super thin udon!
 We’re not looking for food!
 But usually if somebodyis living by himself,
 he’d probably stack upon a bit more food…
 There’s only instant cup-udon.
 Didn’t he eat out a lot?I hear that he went to Ichiraku a lot…
 Right, Naruto?
 Oh… Yeah.
 If he cooked himself, he could haveeaten more and saved money…
 Choji, we’re not talking about you.
 That old manbarely talked about himself…
 Just as I expected.
 Oh, but he did happily talk about
 how he became friendswith one of the kids in the village.
 He might have heard somethingfrom the old man.
 Oh, I wonder about that.
 What you mean you wonder about that?
 We won’t know until we find the kidand question him, won’t we?
 But it seems like there’s no need for usto look for him or question him.
 What?! Then, where is this guy!
 Idiot, that kid is you, Naruto!
 What?! Me?!
 Yeah, there’s no mistake about that.
 You’re Naruto Uzumaki?
 Huh?
 We want you totalk with us for a bit.

 Spat at that beloved face!!Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stagedoes bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feelin my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s fromthat coke I just drank?
 I wonder what kind of interrogationNaruto is undergoing?
 I guess they would useRegressive Hypnosis or something.
 What’s Regressive Hypnosis?
 It’s a Jutsu to draw outsubconscious memories.
 Then Naruto might know somethingeven with his bad memory.
 Hmm. I wonder about that.
 Well, this Old Man Genno soundslike he was pretty tricky…
 Wait, why are you here anyway?

 How is that your answer…Princess Tsunade?
 To think you’d try to kill me…
 At any rate,I have a sincere trust in you, Kabuto.
 A trust for your loyalty and your eyesthat spotted Tsunade’s attack.
 Yes. We’re both fromthe same medical corps so…
 Her Chakra was overflowingwith violent intent.
 Tsunade… I was really planningon resurrecting those two people.
 And here I went so far as to promisenot to smash the Leaf Village…
 Orochimaru…
 I know that your promise of”not touching the village” was a lie…
 Even though I knew that…I…
 Just one more timewould’ve been fine…
 Just one more time,I wanted to see them…
 Just one more time…I wanted to touch them…
 Just one more time…To see those smiling faces…
 But…
 the moment I felt thatrush in my bones…
 that I’d be able to see Nawakiand Dan shortly…
 I realized that I’m a hopeless fool!
 Just by remembering those faces…
 I become this blinded.
 Big sister!
 Tsunade…
 I loved them…I truly loved them!
 So, I wanted to see themand hug them in my arms!
 But…I couldn’t…
 I won’t lose the bet,no matter what!
 Because of that kid…I remembered the dreams of the two.
 Here I was trying to forget…
 This village is grandfather’s treasure!
 I’m going to protect it!
 'Cuz I’m the grandsonof the First Hokage
 who built the Village Hidden in Leaves!
 I love this village and my comrades…
 So I want to protect them.
 Right! Someday,I’ll become just like Grandfather.
 And the Hokage name will be mine!
 Unlike you… I will be the heir tothe Hokage name, no matter what!
 Since my little sister died,that sole thought has sustained me.
 So I’ll become the Hokage…
 An existence that protects everyone…
 – Becoming the Hokage is my dream!– Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 The precious dreams thatthey risked their lives for…
 Making those dreams come truewas also my desire…
 Things that have formedeventually decay… You said that.
 But…
 after all, these are feelingsthat won’t decay…
 So our negotiations have broken down…lt can’t be helped.
 Since it’s come to this, I have no choicebut to ask forcibly.
 Breakdown! The Deal is Off!
 Come! Orochimaru!
 Come to think of it,
 we’ve never gone at iteven once until now.
 That’s right!
 What’re you saying?
 I’m the one who hasto go at it with her, right?
 Now I’m going to killyou two worthless punks…here!
 Incredible strength as usual…
 It’ll be over if you’re hit once.
 I can see that…
 It’s a bit cramped herefor fighting at a distance.
 Are you going to change the location?
 That would probably be better…
 There was another troublesome personwith the Lady Tsunade’s attendant.
 That person may cometo her aid.
 You’re going down!
 Who is…the troublesome person?
 One of Sannin,the same as you and Lady Tsunade…
 Jiraiya!
 I won’t let you get away,no matter what!
 Wh-What’s this?!
 Huh… Princess Tsunade tore it up…big time.
 This means that Lady Tsunade refused…
 Where did old Tsunade go?
 That belongs to Lady Tsunade…!
 Tonton… Which way?
 Okay!
 It looks like you’re quiteout of breath, too… Tsunade.
 It’s just about time.
 I’m not that great at Taijutsu, but…
 A Food Pill!
 That Sign…!
 This kid can also use Medical Ninjutsu…
 He got my muscle…!
 I severed, ever so slightly,
 the bicep muscle of your upper armand the rectus muscle of your thigh.
 Now you won’t be able to releaseyour incredible strength.
 A Chakra scalpel, eh…Why don’t you target the arteries?
 Indeed, with this scalpel,
 I could cut the muscles and vesselswithout external injury.
 But as may be expected,
 I can’t make a long, delicate scalpelin the middle of battle
 that can reach the arteriesand the heart muscle.
 But, even so…
 there’d be no problem at allif I target the opponent’s neck!
 Dang it! My intercostals got hit.My breathing…
 He’s no ordinary Medical Ninja.
 His Jutsu sense and his edgeexceed even me in my heyday!
 It would still be troubleif you were to die on me.
 I won’t target your vital spot…
 But with this, you can’t move anymore…
 She’s amazing…
 Ordinarily, one wouldn’t be ableto budge due to difficulty breathing.
 It looks like it will be necessaryto rough her up a little more…
 but not enough to kill her.
 Even though I’m trying to move my hand…
 my leg moves?!
 D-Don’t tell me! This is…
 You little!
 In my present condition,
 this seems to be the extent of my power…
 I see…
 It’s… It’s not the muscles…lt’s the nerves!
 It seems you’ve realized…That’s right. It’s the nerves!
 I changed Chakra into electricity…
 made an electrical field andpoured electricity into your nerves.
 The communication betweenthe brain and the body
 is all done with electric signals…
 Tsunade jumbled up all ofthe electric signals that are exchanged
 at a velocity of 360 kilometers per hour.
 Having left battle and yet such power…
 So this is the legendary Sannin?
 Healing-types use too much Chakra…
 But in this condition…
 If I try to move my right hand…
 my left leg moves.
 If I try to move my left ankle…
 my right shoulder moves.
 It’s difficult…
 But I’ve already grasped eighty percentof what moves when I move what.
 Don’t mess with me…
 with this low-level…
 Jutsu!
 What?! In only a moment,his body movements…
 You’re scared of blood, aren’t you?!
 I’ll show you plenty from now!
 Jiraiya…?
 It’s been a long time… Jiraiya.
 Orochimaru…
 You’ve got an evil look as usual.
 Huh?!
 K-Kabuto?
 Naruto…
 I see… So you know each other?
 We took the Chunin Exam together!
 Why are you here, Kabuto…?
 Get out of the way!
 Hey…
 I’ll take…
 these guys!
 Just because you’ve masteredyour body movements…
 it doesn’t mean…
 you can move like normal!
 I won’t let you get away now!
 Too late!
 My body movements havefinally returned…
 Blood…!
 Having two of the legendary Sanninas opponents is hairy, isn’t it…?
 So even if it's just one…I'll stop you!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Say! Say! What’s happening?!
 Why’s Kabuto fightingwith old Tsunade?!
 You’re slow, Naruto…
 That’s why you’re no match for Sasuke.
 Take a good look at the headband!
 He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.
 Wha--?!
 That’s right…
 I was a spy fromthe Village Hidden in the Sound.
 Wh-What’re you saying?
 You’re lying, right, Kabuto?
 During the Chunin Examyou taught us a lot…
 And you also saved us.
 Well, I wanted to gather dataon you guys.
 Naruto, there’s somethingI understood by gathering your data.
 You have no Ninja ability.
 Unlike Sasuke!
 It’s the first timeI’ve seen Lady Tsunade like this…
 Please don’t push it too far alone.
 I’m your attendant, so…
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 Even with a fierce look,
 you’re just a cute Geninwho’s a fish out of water.
 Admittedly, I was anticipatingthe monster dwelling inside you…
 But now,with the legendary Sannin before me,
 you leave something to be desired.
 You’re just a puny zero.So if you meddle…
 I’ll kill you.
 You little!
 Don’t, Naruto!
 My body’s still…
 That hand…
 He shouldn’t be able to usethat right hand anymore.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 I’ll attack at once with four…
 and break him from the right sidewhere he can’t defend!
 You little!
 Okay!
 What?
 Blood?
 Poison Needles!
 My neural reflexes still haven’tcompletely returned!
 I can’t dodge completely!
 With the headband…!
 Good job, acting so quickly…
 Thanks, Shizune!
 That’s…
 A Plasma Pill!
 A Plasma Pill?
 So he’s trying to replenishlost blood, huh…
 That kid is a Medical Ninja same as me…
 The blood is gushing out nicely,eh, Kabuto?
 Lord Orochimaru…
 Please take off the bandageon your left arm.
 That man is Orochimaru…
 At last, the real thing appears…
 Shizune!
 Y-Yes!
 You take care of…that guy with the glasses!
 I’ll take care of Orochimaru!
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 Enough already, you traitor!
 Don't you dare touchOld Lady Tsunade again!
 Hey Old Lady,just like our wager
 I will definitely winthat unlucky necklace from you!
 I won't run away!I won't give up!
 Just watch.This is my Way of Ninja!

 Remembrance:  The Lost Page
 All right! I’m up for it today again,believe it!
 However… There haven’t beenany flashy missions around here lately.
 C’mon! It’s unbelievable, right?!
 Yeah well…
 Lately, I’m dead tired from doingnothing but training.
 Sakura!
 Naruto!
 There’s someone who gottoo much time on his hands!
 What’s that?! Speak for yourself.
 No matter how I look at it,you are just helping the shop.
 What happened to Shikamaruand Choji?
 On a mission with Asuma Sensei!
 Oh, I wanted to go on a mission too!
 While Ino was down with a cold,everyone went on urgent missions.
 And now I’m completely recovered!
 What am I going to do withall my fighting spirit?
 Why don’t you use that fighting spiritin some training?
 That’s what you think!
 In my family, if you don’t havea training partner,
 then they make up some reasonfor you to help out with the shop!
 They must know that if you’re aloneyou’ll skip training, eh?
 H-Hey! Don't say something thatcould hurt a person’s reputation!
 I do it properly by myself.
 Naruto…
 Stop it, Shino! Don’t surprise me!
 Naruto Uzumaki… Yamanaka Ino…
 The Hokage is askingfor both of you.
 What? Me too?
 By the way, I’ve also been ordered to go,along with you guys.
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Ino… me and Shino?
 Huh?
 Demon of Ocean causing disturbance…?
 Yes, literally a demon in the ocean.
 It seems to be the cause of the disturbancehappening in the remote Land of Sea…
 What’s wrong…?
 You’ll go for me, won’t you?
 Of course.
 Shizune…
 Y-Yes!
 Explain…
 Y-Yes!
 As you can see,
 the Land of Sea is made up ofa group of islands of various sizes.
 Recently in that area, their only meansof transportation, ships,
 are being attacked and robbedof money and valuables.
 The people on the boat whowere victimized
 unanimously claim that the damagewas done by the “Demon of the Ocean.”
 And exterminating this Demonof the Ocean is the mission?
 Well… more or less, yes.But there’s more.
 The Land of Sea does not havea hidden village of its own,
 so they’re prepared for contingencies
 through military cooperation withthe neighboring country, the Land of Water,
 and have been paying thema retainer every month…
 However, the other day,one of their ships that collects funds
 was attacked bythe Demon of the Ocean as well…
 I see. To preserve their relationshipwith Land of Water,
 Land of Sea will do anythingto protect the next ship.
 Yes… This mission is to guardthe ships collecting funds
 and destroy the Demon of the Ocean…
 I’ve got a few people to work under you,so I’m counting on you.
 Work under me… ?
 Enter!
 Huh?
 The Chunin Exam’s…
 Th-That scary proctor!
 Oh, you’re bringing back memories..!
 A-Anko Mitarashi Sensei?
 Why are you here?
 – Everyone! 					– Yes!

 Naruto Uzumaki!
 The three of you will work under Ankoand accompany her on a mission!
 What?! These members?
 The team is pretty disjointed, isn’t it?!
 No use talking about it!
 Listen... I’ve thought throughthe matter and
 I believe that this combination is
 the most qualified for this mission…
 All of you display your own capabilitiesto the full extent and execute this mission!
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 She just gathered the available Genin…Really, she is such a…
 Still, something doesn’t feel quite right…
 Yeah, yeah, no complaints abouta mission that’s settled!
 Ouuch… I got it!
 Okay, we’ll depart right away!
 Everyone prepare and assembleat the front gate!
 – Roger! 					– Roger!
 Oh, ouch!
 Anko…
 Be careful…
 Yes…
 Characteristics ofthe Demon of the Ocean...
 It’s like a fish, like a person...What is this?!
 Huh, someone’s eyes are playing tricks.Something like that can’t exist!
 Not true, it’s possible that Ex-Ninjabecome pirates
 and use Transformation and Genjutsu.
 Well, whatever, if we don’t gatherinformation, there will be no solution.
 Right…
 Mother Island is the biggest islandat the center of Land of Sea…
 We’ll go to a nearby fishing portand cross over by boat!
 – I understand!– I understand!
 Yeah! Let’s depart for the Land of Sea!
 This guy is always hyper…
 I'm anxious about what’s going to happen.
 Here you are…
 Um… Lady Tsunade…
 Hmm?
 It’s about…Anko Mitarashi just now…
 Did, uh…Did something happen in the past?
 Sort of…
 Oh? This is…
 Her record of missions from aboutthe age of ten is pretty sporadic.
 Because Anko was under Orochimaru...
 So the parts that are blacked out
 are combinedwith Orochimaru’s movements…
 and in the confidential file?
 Part of them are…
 Huh?
 There are some partsthat aren’t recorded…
 That’s the truth.
 No record?! Even thoughAnko herself was in the village?
 That Orochimaru…
 It seems he really didn’twant to be traced…
 When he left the village…
 He erased part of Anko’s memories.
 The wind is salty…
 Coming this far, we can alreadysee over the Land of Sea.
 Then, that must be the Mother Island?
 What ? What is this feeling?
 Everyone… Sorry but…
 Go ahead and take careof the arrangements for the boat.
 What? But, what would you do, Sensei?
 I’ll take care of some businessand join you… See you!
 Oh! Sensei?!
 C’mon, it can’t be helped…
 What are you doing, Shino?
 We’ll leave you behind!
 Yeah…
 The Curse Mark aches.
 This presence… No question about it.
 This way?
 I can say their nameswithout a problem!
 Um… That’s Mother Island…
 These are Taro Island and Jiro island.
 And… That there’s Demon Island!
 Seems you prepared before you came…
 I want to become a wiser, strongerShinobi like you, Master Orochimaru…
 Oh…?
 Here.
 Sorry, but I can’t give you anythingmore than this.
 What’s up…lno?
 Hey, mister!
 Aren’t you bringing prices downway too much?
 That’s high-quality fish, isn’t it?
 Oh dear…
 I’m not price-cutting…
 See...
 Because of that ""Demon of the Ocean""  uproar,
 customers are completely staying away...
 This is the market price around here.
 Really? That fish is rarely…Oh!
 What’s with her appearance?ls she injured or something?
 No… That girl, she has her reasons.
 Well…
 She’s a female diver from a small townon the cape of Mother Island…
 What?!
 Why would a woman diver onMother Island transfer islands on purpose?
 That’s because, the island peopledidn’t want to do business with her…
 That girl…
 In the past, she was spirited away…
 Spirited away…?
 A person suddenly disappears…is that it?
 That’s right!
 In the past,
 a lot of island people disappearedfrom being spirited away.
 The story is that out of all those people
 that girl was the only onewho suddenly returned one day.
 Hey, hey!
 It’s a little village…
 So everyone felt creepy.
 They say that now, she lives aloneoutside of the village…
 I see… I feel sorry for her.
 With her appearance...And then you hear things, I too...
 feel a little bit creepy…
 That's true.
 Hey, where’s Naruto?
 I don’t know…
 Hey! What are you guys doing?!
 Oh no!
 Hey, are you okay?
 Yes…
 You’re uh… You’re from a place calledMother Island, aren’t you?
 Hm?
 Uh… Nothing…
 Ninja…
 Oh, I’ll help!
 That’s okay…
 Huh…? H-Hey… Wait.
 What the…?
 It’s too bad but, the last boat fromthe port has already left.
 But the sun hasn’t even set yet…
 Around here, there’s nobody whowill take you across in the early evening...
 Sorry, but come back tomorrow.
 No way…
 Well, is there a way to get toMother Island besides the ferry?
 Mmm, I can’t really advise it, but…
 If it’s necessary,I’ll let you borrow my little boat.
 Hey! I was looking all over for you guys!
 C’mon! Where were you?!
 Sorry, sorry…
 You should at least say somethingbefore you disappear.
 You and Sensei are exactly alike,suddenly going someplace.
 Feels like there’ll bea bumpy road ahead.
 What?! That’s rude.
 Placing me in the same category togetherwith that unreasonable sensei--!
 Who’s what?
 S-Sorry.
 This sensei… is dangerous, after all…
 Good work procuring the boat!
 S-Sensei… Where in the worldhave you been all this time?
 Oh, something likegathering information…
 Well, let’s go!
 The Shinobi of Leaf Village are here…
 Land of Sea must havepleaded with them
 to investigate onthe “Demon of the Ocean.”
 Well then, we should give themthe best welcome.
 It’s getting dark…
 We’re almost to Mother Island.
 All right, all right!
 Full speed advance to Mother Island!
 Although the sun has already set ...
 Where does all your hyper-energycome from?!
 Times like this,your state of mind is important!
 Sakura sure has her share of trouble…I feel sorry for her.
 What the…!I ran up against a rock or something!
 Hang in there, Naruto!
 Hey, all of you look forward, front!
 Dodge it, quick!
 You say that, but…
 It’s no good, the oar won’t move!

 Oh! Hey, wait!
 Summoning Jutsu.
 Please come out, Chief Toad!
 Hey, good evening!
 It can't be!I have been calling for Chief Toad!
 Stupid! If you summonedthe old man to a place like this,
 terrible things would happen.
 Huh? Why?

 I don’t like salty things either.

 Shoot! I can’t approach themso easily with this.
 Naruto…
 I can’t stand this!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 To think the departure ofthe collection ship
 would be moved upat the time like this.
 It can’t be helped.
 We’ve got to find Naruto somehowby tomorrow morning.
 I hope we pick up some information aboutthe Demon of the Ocean along the way.
 The search range is quite expansive, huh?
 It’d be best to split up.
 Then I’ll go from the south,you guys take the north.
 – Roger! 					– Roger!
 Think about what happened yesterday.
 Each of you, tackle this with care. Scatter!
 Next time: “The Closed Door”

 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Mess up the village…you say?!
 I won’t let you do thatno matter what!
 I mean, there’s no wayjust the four of you can do that!
 But, we can…
 A person who knows village mattersvery well gave us information
 on where and how to attack.
 Knows village matters very well…
 It couldn’t be!
 You mean Orochimaru?!
 Who knows…?
 Well, that’s how it is,so we can’t have you guys living.
 Umm, can you see this?
 Paper Bombs!
 We’re going to detonatethe Paper Bombs
 after we’ve left here…
 There’s nowhere to run…
 There’s no chance of someonecoming to save you.
 Prepare yourselves.
 It’s better than going backto the Academy, isn’t it?
 Umm, rest in peace.
 H-Hey! Just a minute!
 Farewell, real me.
 Run, Dodge, Zigzag!Chase or be Chased!
 It should’ve just beenhunting for treasure,
 but to think this would happen…
 Sure enough,nothing good comes
 of being together with youon missions, Naruto!
 This isn’t the time to besaying stuff like that!
 They’re attempting to mess upthe Leaf Village by impersonating us!
 Then how’re we goingto get out of here?!
 Well…
 If I use the Rasengan,I could somehow…
 They’d notice that!
 It’d be the end if we wereto get ambushed outside.
 Then, with your Fang Over Fang…
 That’d be the same, the same!
 You moron!
 Then what should we do?!
 – Umm… 					– Huh?
 If I usemy Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms…
 I get it!
 With that we can weather this crisiswithout the guys outside noticing!
 If I could just loosenthese ropes a little…
 Leave that to me!
 N-Naruto?!
 All right!
 Me, too!
 Kiba…
 Akamaru…
 Just a little more…
 It snapped…
 Protective 8 Trigrams…
 64 Palms!
 Now then,shall we go as arranged?
 – Kiba! 					– Yeah!
 – Hinata! 					– Yes!
 Naruto!
 I know!
 Hinata!
 You okay?
 Oh…!
 What…?
 Hey, Hinata!Cut our ropes before you faint.
 Right.
 It seems the guys outsideare gone.
 It doesn’t look like this placeis going to hold up now.
 It looks like it’d be best for usto escape as soon as we can.
 What’s that?!
 It’s the buried treasure chest.
 Leave it be!
 It’s a fake anyway.
 And there might besome kind of trap set.
 But it’s our mission totake this back with us, so…
 There really might beburied treasure in it, right?!
 Byakugan!
 It looks empty inside…Wait, there’s paper inside.
 Isn’t it a Paper Bomb?
 It doesn’t seem to beanything dangerous…
 Then I guess I’ll take it for now.
 Come on, there’s no needto go to the trouble of…
 But it might make for a good markto distinguish him from the imposter…
 I get it.
 Akamaru, you’re the mark forthe real me, so stay close to me.
 There’s no time.
 I’ll be going with our Fang Over Fang.Make sure you keep up!
 R-Right.
 Man-Beast Clone…
 Fang Over Fang!
 You okay, Hinata?
 I’m fine… I just have to followafter Kiba, so…I’ll be o…
 Hinata!
 All right!
 You okay, Hinata?
 Naruto!
 Does your leg hurt?
 Kiba…
 If your leg hurts, say so first.
 I was thinkingI must not cause trouble, so…
 Actually, that is trouble.
 I’m sorry…
 Surprisingly, this might bethe weakness of our team.
 Huh…?
 Hinata shows too muchconcern for us.
 Naruto and I speak too bluntly toeach other and we get into fights…
 N-Now that you mention it…
 If we’d take on our missions whilebeing a little conscious of stuff like that,
 we might…become a pretty good team.
 Got it!
 I’ll try…
 All right. Then Naruto and I will goafter those guys.
 Hinata, you come later.Your leg’s hurt, so don’t force things…
 Got it.
 Listen up. You’re hurt, Hinata.So you follow later.
 I just said that, didn’t I?
 Huh? Did you?
 Right…Thanks…
 Let’s go, Naruto!
 I have to hurry, too…
 I’m back!
 You’re back, Naruto?
 We couldn’t catch upwith them, huh…?
 Naruto? Kiba?!
 Was I here just now?!
 Y-Yeah.
 That one was an imposter!
 Say what?!
 But the dog didn’t notice anything…
 He can’t be sniffed out evenwith the nose of a Ninja Hound!
 Akamaru was fooled, too!
 We’ve got trouble!To the Hokage, immediately.
 Right!
 Akamaru! You remember the smellof that Agari old man, right?!
 After him!
 Lady Tsunade!
 We’ve just receiveda communication…!
 Nobody realizes it.
 Stay sharp.Our mission isn’t over yet, so.
 That’s right.The crucial part comes now.
 Someone’s coming!
 We found you, imposters!
 We’ll kick your butts!
 Oh-ho… So you’re alive…
 Naturally!
 This time it’s your turnto prepare yourselves…
 After all, this is our home field.
 There are times when you lose
 even when fightingon your home field!
 We won’t let you get away!
 H-Hinata?!
 I’m going to inform the Hokage!
 Naruto, you go after the imposters!
 Got  …it.
 Hey…
 Upon careful thought,the real Hinata hasn’t come yet…!
 You imposter!
 What the…?!
 What’re you doing to Hinata?!
 It’s just like I’m the imposter.
 Naruto!
 What’re you doing?!
 W-Well…
 He’s an imposter!
 What?!
 Prepare yourself, imposter!
 Hey! Wait a minute…!
 Hey, you’re also an imposter!
 Even if you can copythe appearance and scent,
 you can’t go so far ascopy Ninjutsu, right?!
 Let’s go, Akamaru.
 Fang Over…?
 Knocked out…?
 No way. It was just a punch,and I didn’t even use a Jutsu…
 Come to think of it…
 I was slugged good and hard,but I didn’t feel it at all.
 Hey! Weren’t you goingto mess up the village?!
 You guys are utterly weak!
 Damn it!
 I’ll catch the fake Hinata,so you handle yourself somehow!
 Leave me to me!
 Hold it!
 Hold it!
 I wonder if I got overly ambitiousand borrowed too many books…
 Hey, Naruto!
 You…
 You moron!
 You’re butt is so heavyyou fell right on it!
 Ugly! Ugly!
 Forehead girl!
 I’ll kick your buttthe next time I see you!
 I’ll kick your butt,no matter what!
 Sakura, get out of the way!
 Naruto.
 I’ll kick your butt!
 Wh-Why?!
 What?
 Why’s the Naruto who ran that waycoming from over here?
 I’m off on a delivery.
 Right. Take care.
 What is it?! You okay, Ayame?!
 Y-Yeah. Naruto suddenly flew in…
 What…?
 Na-ru-to!
 How dare you do thatto my daughter…?!
 Wh-What…?
 I’m okay, Dad.
 No, you rest a bit.
 I will have Naruto take the responsibilityand make the delivery!
 What?!
 But, but I…
 If you refuse,
 I’ll never let you eatmy ramen ever again!
 This isn’t the time for meto be making a delivery!
 I finished the delivery!
 Okay! Good work!
 Where did he go?!
 My…imposter!
 This jerk was also weak…
 Kiba… Stop… 					Forgive me…
 That might’ve worked on Naruto.But I hate soppy stuff…
 like that!
 Did these guys seriouslyintend to attack the village…?
 Where are you, imposter?!
 Come out!
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Could it be that I came here?
 Yeah, you did.
 You’ll be paying me forwhat you ate earlier.
 That jerk…!
 Forty-five plates…
 Here.
 Eating and running withsomeone else’s face…
 That imposter…
 He’s not messing up the village,he’s messing up my reputation.
 Hey…
 No way…!

 I’d been setting aside!
 I won’t allow it…!
 No matter what, I won’t allow it…!

 – Go! 					– Go!
 – Where is he?!– Where’s the imposter?!
 – Where are you?!– Imposter!
 Where are you?! Come out!
 I’ll kill you, imposter!
 I’ll pay the bill later!
 – Find him! 					– Where is he?!
 There he is!
 Hey!
 – I won’t let you get away!– Got you!
 – I’ve got you!– You're wrong!
 – Is it you?!– I’m not an imposter!
 Calm down, guys!
 The imposter isn’t carryinga chest on his back!
 – What? 					– It's not him?
 – Now that you mention it…– That's right.
 That’s right!
 Then…
 It’s him!
 Yikes!
 At the end of the day,these guys were nothing special.
 Hey, are these guys reallyOrochimaru’s henchmen?
 Who knows?
 The Hokage will lookinto the details for us.
 That’s right.
 Man, I’m tired.
 My shoulders got stiff from carryingthis thing around the whole time.
 Naruto! Kiba!
 Oh, the real Hinata’s come back.
 Hey, Hinata! Over here!
 Naruto!
 He’s not carrying the chest on his back…Then this Naruto…
 He’s the imposter!
 Gentle Fist!
 Oh, boy. I feel bad for that Naruto…
 – What?! 					– What?!
 A test?!
 This mission was a test
 in order to see the teamworkof you three.
 A Shinobi will often have toform teams with various others
 in response to the qualitiesand conditions of the mission.
 At such times,
 failing if teamed witha certain other person is a problem.
 And so I gave you a missionthat was easy at the start.
 And I made it so alongthe way…
 something would happeninvolving a village crisis.
 At that time,
 I wanted to see whetheryou could handle it as a team.
 So that’s what it was…
 That’s harsh!
 We would’ve died ifwe’d made the slightest mistake.
 It’s okay. I got the story aboutyou guys from Lady Tsunade.
 It was set up so even ifyou were to make a mistake,
 you would only be injured.
 Since this time aroundyou had the Ninja HoundDog Akamaru,
 I enlisted the helpof the Kedouin Clan…
 so you wouldn’t be ableto distinguish the enemy.
 And?
 How did these three do?
 Let me see…
 They floundered part of the wayand I was worried about the outcome…
 But I shall pass them.
 In terms of results,they did capture us, so…
 Oh yeah.
 That’s…!
 It was more or lessour mission to bring this, so.
 With this, our mission is complete.
 There’s no point in goingto the trouble of bringing…
 No, no.
 There is something important insidethat I must give to you, Lady Hokage.
 Farewell, Naruto. Take it easy.
 You, too.
 See ya.
 Yeah.
 Are they going to looklike that forever?
 It seems they’ll get their own faces backnaturally in a few days.
 I see…
 Wh-What’s this…?!
 A bill for the recent training…?!
 Here…he said he’d be gladto cooperate…
 It comes to this much?
 This is a hard world to live in,isn’t it?
 My name is Tsunade…
 My concern now is a debtthat absolutely will not go down.
 More like, it’s growing, isn’t it?
 I shouldn’t have become…the likes of Hokage…!

 You gave it?
 So it should reachthe other party today.

 Yup!
 Yes!
 Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!
 This medicine works really well!
 Here! Do you want touse it too, Sakura?
 Only your wounds healwith such speed…Naruto.
 The power of Nine Tail nevercease to amaze me.
 U-Umm...
 T-This is…
 ointment for your wound,
 for you Kiba and Akamaru.
 Rather than worrying about others,
 it’s about time you worriedabout yourself!
 Kiba…
 There are only 6 people left…
 you, Choji, Neji, Lee, one Sound guy,and the Sand guy.
 Listen, Hinata…
 If you pull that guy from Sand,withdraw quickly.
 And there’s one more…
 Do the same if you get Neji, too.
 Withdraw quickly…
 That guy will be hard on you.
 He will destroy you.
 Well, let’s announce the next match.
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 – What? 					– Huh?
 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 Hinata…
 This is going to be an interesting match…
 I never thought that I wouldhave a fight with you…
 Lady Hinata.
 Brother Neji…
 Brother?
 Huh?!
 Those two are siblings?
 They’re descended from
 one of the most honorableold families in the Hidden Leaf…
 The Hyuga Clan.
 But, they’re not siblings.
 Then, how are they related?
 Well, the relation of a head familyand branch family…
 That may be an appropriateway to say it.
 Head family and branch family?
 Yes!
 Hinata is from the head family.
 In other words, a person fromthe main household
 and Neji is from a branch familythat is descended from that family.
 In other words,it’s a fight between relatives.
 It must be uneasy for both of them…
 Yes.
 However…
 Huh? What is it?
 I’ve heard that from long ago,
 there’ve been various incidents betweenthe head family and branch family,
 and now their relationshipisn’t on very good terms.
 Hmmm.
 Why?
 I don’t know the details either.
 Only…
 The so-called distinguished Ninja clanslike Uchiha and Hyuga
 have special techniques andabilities that run in the family.
 It seems that the Hyuga householdlaid down rules
 for communicating those techniques…
 It seems that there are many rulesthat favor the head family…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 And there have beenvarious incidents
 between the head family andbranch family due to those rules.
 So this is a confrontation billedas a clash of fate…
 Oh, it’s gonna begin.
 Start the battle please!
 Just one thing before we square offagainst each other in the fight…
 I should advise you, Lady Hinata.
 Withdraw!
 You’re not suited to being a Shinobi.
 You’re too nice.
 You wish for harmony andavoid conflict,
 you’re open to going withthe thinking of others.
 And, you have no confidencein yourself.
 You’re always feeling inferior…
 You thought it’s a good ideato stay Genin.
 However, you can’t register forthe Chunin test without three members…
 So you couldn’t turn down when Kibaand the other proposed it and,
 the truth is, you enteredthe exam reluctantly.
 Is that wrong?!
 T-That’s wrong…
 That’s not true…
 I…
 I only…
 I wanted to change that about myself…
 So I proposed it myself…
 Hinata…
 Stand up, Hanabi!
 From now on, I’ll keep Hinataunder my wing…
 But is that really okay?
 Hinata should be the heir tothe Hyuga clan…
 But, there is always death involvedwith the job of Genin.
 Do what you want.
 She’s a failure who’s inferior even to heryounger sister Hanabi, five years her junior.
 We don’t need her herein Hyuga clan…
 Is that all you have to say?
 If so, leave!
 You’re in the way!
 Yes.
 Hinata is trying to changeherself in her own way.
 Lady Hinata…
 You are a spoiled one ofthe head family.
 People can never change!
 A failure will always be a failure…
 That personality and strengthwon’t change.
 That guy…
 Since people don’t change,differences exist among them…
 and expressions like “elite”and “failure” are born.
 Everyone judges and are judged
 based on the value of their face andbrain, ability and body type,
 good and bad points oftheir personalities.
 People have to suffer and live
 within the means of theelements they cannot change.
 Just like the fact that I’m from abranch family
 and you’re from the head family,
 these things can’t change.
 I’ve seen everything withthis Byakugan.
 That’s why I understand!
 You’re just talking tough.
 You’re really thinking that you’dlike to run away from this place…
 T-That’s wrong…
 I really…
 Byakugan?
 It’s said that if you tracethe Uchiha Clan’s history,
 the clan’s ability has its sourcein Hyuga clan.
 The Byakugan is one of theHyuga clan’s Kekkei Genkai,
 a Visual Jutsu similarto Sharingan…
 However, with the ability of insight alone…
 it gets the better of Sharingan.
 Byakugan!
 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 My eyes can’t be deceived.
 Just now from my pressure,
 your line of sight was pushedto the upper left.
 This is the sign that you're recallingyour past experience…
 your bitter past.
 And soon after that, your line of sightmoved to the bottom right…
 This is the sign that you're imaginingphysical and mental suffering.
 That means…
 you’re picturing your old self,
 and from all of your experiencesup until now,
 you’re imagining the resultof this battle…
 The image of you losing!
 Even the act of propping your armsin front of your body…
 It’s a gesture that means
 you want to build a wallbetween us and keep distant.
 And that reflects your mind...
 that you don’t want any moreof your deepest feelings to be raided…
 Because everything I’ve saidis right on the mark, right?
 Furthermore…
 Laying a finger on your lips,
 that too, is a self-familiarizing actwhich represents a sense of panic.
 It represents a defense instinct--
 you want to alleviate the tensionand unease.
 In other words…
 deep in your heart,you know it’s true, don’t you?
 Changing yourself,is something you absolutely can’t--!
 Sure, she can!
 You don’t have the privilege ofdeciding what a person is like, stupid!
 Give it to him, Hinata!
 Naruto…
 Hinata!
 Don’t just take it!Argue back!
 I’m getting irritated watching this!
 Naruto…
 What an annoying guy!
 Naruto…
 Thank you!
 The expression of her eyeshas changed…
 So you’re not going to withdraw?
 I ‘m not taking responsibilityfor what happens!
 I…
 I won’t run away!
 I don’t…
 I don’t change my words…
 That’s my Way of Ninja!
 ...want to run anymore!
 Byakugan!
 Brother Neji!
 I challenge you!
 T-That is…
 Fine…
 Of course, the same Hyuga style…
 Her pose is very similarto Neji’s.
 Hyuga style?
 The strongest Taijutsu stylein the Village Hidden in the Leaf…
 Huh?
 I said it before...
 The man who is most likely
 the strongest Genin of HiddenLeaf Village is on my team…
 That’s…
 That guy, Neji Hyuga.
 Here!
 Did it go in?!
 No…it was shallow!
 No. Even a graze works.
 That’s the reason that the Hyuga clan
 is called the Hidden Leaf’sdistinguished family.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 The Hyuga has a particularTaijutsu passed down through generations.
 It’s not like the kind of Taijutsu thatLee and I are good at…
 Our way of fighting, Furious Fist,
 is mainly to inflict external damageon our enemy,
 like broken bones and surface wounds.
 In contrast, the Hyuga’s Taijutsuinflict damage
 on the Chakra Network throughwhich Chakra flow through the body,
 and damaging the insides,namely, it destroys internal organs.
 They possess the Gentle Fist.
 It’s not spectacular to watch…
 but later it slowly takes effect.
 Well, you can’t train the internal organs…
 Even if you were really robust,
 one hit from it would bea deadly blow…
 Even I can…
 Hinata’s on the offensive…
 Hinata…
 Way to go, Hinata!
 To attack the Chakra Network…
 What are they, those people…?
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Chakra Network, what’s that?!
 Here we go again…
 a question from a stupid guy.
 I’ll explain.
 They’re like blood canals.
 In the same way that blood flowsthrough vessels throughout the body,
 They’re bundles of canals that takeChakra’s into every corner of your body…
 Oh!
 Like a path for Chakras, huh?
 Yes…
 Furthermore, the Chakra Networkis closely connected
 with the internal organs whichenfold Chakra within the body.
 That’s why ifthe Chakra Network is attacked
 the internal organs also suffer damage.
 Huh, you know a lot, don’t 'ya?
 Hey you!That's no way to talk to your senior!
 It’s no wonder…
 Lee’s greatest long-standing enemy.
 That’s…
 him.
 Sensei…
 But, how can they do that?
 After all, the Chakra Networkisn’t visible to the eyes.
 How do they attack the Chakraline inside the body?
 No.
 The eyes of those two…
 They can see it withtheir Byakugan.
 And a Gentle Fist attack is a littledifferent from a regular attack.
 They release their own Chakra
 from a Chakra opening in their handand screw it into their opponent’s body.
 It directly inflicts damage onyour enemy’s Chakra Network.
 All right!
 Has she done it?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Amazing!
 That Hinata!
 She’s always melancholyand wishy-washy and…
 I thought she is kinda weird, yet…
 Even when she gets blow after blow,she gets back up and goes.
 There’s something abouther way of fighting.
 Just a feeling,but she resembles you, I think.
 Resembles me?Hinata resembles me?
 Now that I think about it, that girl,she was always watching you.
 Huh?
 Next episode: “A Failure Stands Tall!”
 Hinata, fight!

165,"I want to try and gatherthe unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Kakashi Sensei…
 The mission in the Land of Birdsis over…
 That is enough.
 But, then what about Naruto…?
 As the leader,I am responsible for all of this.
 Sacrifice is an unavoidable partof Shinobi missions…
 Now…
 Let’s go back to our village!
 Do you think they’re really going backto their village, Nagare?
 Perhaps…
 But I’m concerned about that masked guywho joined up with them later…
 Shall I follow him, Hokushin?
 No, I’ll do that.You give the report.
 All right…
 The Death of Naruto
 How did things turn out…?
 The two as well as the onewho joined up with them later…
 seem to have crossed the border
 and are heading forthe Village Hidden in Leaves.
 I see.
 And it seems Lord Sagitook care
 of the one who infiltrated the residenceof the feudal lord.
 Very nice indeed.
 What’re they doing therefor the past hour…?
 P-Persimmon! 					Wh-What the--?
 – Ouch… 					– That hurts…
 It couldn’t be!
 Substitution Jutsu!Since when…?
 They tricked me!Those Leaf Shinobi…
 Lord Komei… Come out.
 Land of Birds Tactician Komei.
 You have abused the key positionin this land of tactician
 and committed the crimeof assassinating
 the previous feudal lord Lord Owashiand his child Lady Toki.
 And you also ordered a subordinate
 to run wild as the ghostcalled the Cursed Warrior,
 disturbed the public, you underminedthe government of the land,
 endangered Lord Sagi’s positionof feudal lord
 and attempted to attainthe position himself,
 an unforgivable crime of treason!
 Therefore, you are orderedto perform seppuku!
 I see… That explains it.
 You ensnared me,didn’t you, Moso?!
 You’re disgraceful, Komei!lf you’re a warrior, kill yourself like one!
 Assist him with the seppukuat once!
 – Yes, my lord!– Yes, my lord!
 Is this it now…?
 Wh-What?!
 Hidden Mist Jutsu?No! This is…
 It does not matter! Kill him!
 Yes, my lord!
 Begging your pardon,I shall assist!
 Who are you?!
 Wh-What is this?What’s going on?!
 – The Cursed Warrior!– It’s the Cursed Warrior…
 That’s the Cursed Warrior?!
 Yes!
 After him! Don’t let him get away!
 – Right! 					– Right!
 You guys go after him as is…!
 I’ve got somethingI want to look into,
 so I’ll be going on ahead!
 – Roger! 					– Roger!
 I knew it!
 You two were conspirators, right?!
 Hold it!
 You’re the guys fromthe other night…
 I’ve witnessed the true identityof the ghost.
 Who’s there?
 Hey-hey, Komei.
 You’re the one responsible forcontrolling the Cursed Warrior, right?
 I was also attemptingto investigate
 the true identity ofthe Cursed Warrior that day…
 I was almost sure it couldn’tbe anyone but that person…
 What a pain! I’ll exposethe true identity here.
 Don’t bother…
 Kakashi Sensei.Where were you until now?
 I’ll explain later.Go on ahead!
 Hurry! You’re going with them.
 But…
 Let’s go, Tenten!
 Wait, Neji!
 Come on out…
 You were following methe whole time, right?
 If that’s your intention…
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What is it, Kakashi?
 Smoke out the Ninja hidingon the temple grounds…
 Consider it done.
 Hey! You there…
 Hide-and-seek is over.Come on out now!
 I can’t fool a dog’s nose,as would be expected…
 You finally grace me withyour presence, huh?
 Why is there a hole…in a place like this?
 I have heard the feudal lord builtsecret passages such as this
 all over the land in order to look inon the lives of the general public…
 The feudal lord?!
 Then that Cursed Warriorhas something to do
 with the feudal lord…?
 At the very least,it seems he’s not a ghost.
 When the time comes,
 I’m sure he will revealhis true identity from his end.
 Isn’t it common sense forhired Ninja
 to return quietly to their villageafter completing a mission?
 It’s different in the case
 of the premise of the commissionedmission breaking down.
 There were too manysuspicious points in this mission.
 You’re sticking your nose too farinto the business of another land.
 Here you could’ve returned safelyto your land
 if you hadn’t secretivelysniffed around like a dog.
 Excuse me for being a dog!
 Universal Assimilation Jutsu!
 Prepare yourself!
 What?!
 What is this guy?!
 Has he introduced propertiesof stone into his body?
 Since you’ve learned of partof this land’s secrets,
 I can’t let you live!
 He seems to be a somewhattroublesome opponent.
 Yeah. That’s good enough, Pakkun.
 I’ll be okay by myself from here on.
 I see… See you later!
 Assimilation: Rock Tank.
 I’ll crush you!
 A Shadow Clone…?!
 This is as far as it goes…
 It can’t be…
 A Paper Bomb?!
 Now… That should be enough, right?
 Huh?
 Yeah… We should be okayhaving come this far.
 Th-That voice…?!
 N-Naruto…!
 I knew it.
 The true identity of the Cursed Warriorwasn’t Lord Sagi?
 Your…
 Your true identity is…
 Lord Sagi?! It is you, Lord Sagi?
 From the way he was standing still,
 I thought for sure it was Lord Sagi.
 There’s a profound reason for this…
 What’re you doing, Tenten?!
 Then tell me sooner!
 It seems you also knewit was Naruto, Neji.
 Yeah… Ages ago.
 Jeez, you two!
 I was really worried!
 There was a surveillance Shinobifollowing us the whole time, right?
 Neji, Tenten…Don’t look back.
 We’re being followed!
 We’re going back tothe Land of Birds.
 Just do as I say… Got it?!
 Y-Yes!
 Understood…
 But didn’t we shake the pursuerwith Substitution?
 Yes… Once…
 However…
 when we chased the Cursed Warriorfrom the execution grounds…
 a different Shinobi followed us.
 Jeez… Am I the only onewho didn’t know?
 It was a waste to worry!
 Then you,in the place of Lord Sagi…?
 Yeah…
 I see… So Lord Sagi is safe!
 You okay, mister?!
 I’m sorry…
 That Moso acted rashly,
 forcing me to makea false confession.
 Man, you’ve been beaten up good…
 Well, we’ll tell you aboutthe developments inside.
 Sagi is waiting!
 Assimilation: Rock Shower!
 We’re Wandering Shinobi…
 We make do without having a villageby going around to every village,
 stealing Jutsu anddevising new Ninjutsu.
 For example,a Jutsu like this one, too…
 S-Say what?
 Sharingan!
 Assimilation: Sand Coffin!
 He’s using the same Jutsuas Gaara!
 Assimilation: Sand Funeral!
 Sagi!
 How’s Chishima doing…?
 He’s okay…There’s no threat to his life.
 He’s resting and receiving treatment
 in the treatment roomof my residence.
 That’s good…
 Did something happen to Chishima?
 Who…? Who hurt him?!
 Komei… I’m sorry forthe misunderstanding!
 My lord, I don't deservethose magnanimous words!
 Although he had suffered injuries,Chishima came to tell me.
 At that time…
 I must not let you live as is
 now that you have learnedof everything!
 As the thief who snuck intothe residence of the feudal lord,
 your fate is the death sentence!
 No way…!
 L-Lord Sagi…
 Chishima?!
 Bro!
 Shuriken wounds…?
 Go to the residence doctor!
 Lord Sagi…
 Please listen…
 Lord Moso, no,Moso has betrayed you…
 What?
 Moso was the one
 who killed your father, Lord Owashi,and Lady Toki!
 And Moso had his own Ninja henchmenuse the guardsmen shuriken
 to falsely accuse Lord Komei…
 I’m sure Lord Komei learnedof Moso’s scheme and…
 Hang in there, Chishima!
 Lord Sagi, please…Stop Lord Komei’s execution.
 We have to go save him quickly!
 I must not stop the execution!
 Wh-Why is that?!
 I won’t be able to have my revenge
 if Moso realizes thatI have learned the truth…
 Are you saying it doesn’t matterwho is sacrificed
 if it’s for the sake of your revenge?!
 Then what would you do?
 Komei is being kept under strict watchby powerful soldiers.
 We would have no chanceof winning
 if theywe were to causea rebellion there…
 Then I’ll go!I will save Komei on my own!
 You don’t have a problemwith that, do you?
 Lord Sagi…
 Do as you like…
 And so I disguised myselfas the Cursed Warrior.
 I played the part of Cursed Warrior
 and attempted to look forthe assassination culprit…
 But against my intentions…
 Instead of findingthe true culprit…
 Komei… I was used as a toolto incriminate you.
 I thought the Cursed WarriorI encountered in my bedroom
 was you, Lord Sagi…
 And so I headed forthe abandoned temple
 where the Cursed Warrioronce vanished.
 There I encounteredthe Cursed Warrior, but…
 That Cursed Warrior wasn’t me.
 Perhaps it was a fakethat Moso devised.
 That’s it, believe it!All of it was that old man Moso’s trap!
 That Moso!
 Did he think to first disposeof me
 and then eventually attempt to rulethe Land of Birds
 by doing away with Lord Sagi?
 That guy acting like a good guy!
 I’ll grab him up and kick his butt!
 Naruto, was it?You did good work.
 However…
 I will take care of thingsfrom here on!
 Well… But…
 I will even the score by myself.
 As long as the score isn’t settled…
 the clock inside my heart…will remain stopped in the past!
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 What do you mean you willeven the score on your own?!
 What good can you dogoing by yourself?!
 Even you did avenge them,the dead won’t come back!
 Do you still insist on having  revenge?!
 Would that make youfeel better?!
 Would that really makeyour father and sister happy?!

 Master Jiraiya…I believe in you.
 The Summoning Jutsu:Wisdom of the Toad Sage!
 Well well…
 You don’t sleep at all?
 What do you want?
 I thought I’d crush you now.
 If I do that,there’d be the possibility for me,
 after the first battle,to be able to fight Sasuke.
 I know your Sand attack.
 I wonder which is faster,yours or my Sound.
 In the full moon…
 in the full moon, his blood boils.
 W-What the heck…are you?
 Amazing… So that’s his true form?
 But…is it okay?He’s a Sound Ninja …
 It’s all right.He’s long since served his purpose.
 I thought he was a guinea pigin order to see…
 the power of the boycalled Sasuke or something…
 Why…is he with the Sand Ninja?
 No, that’s not necessary anymore…
 Actually, I’d already been orderedto seize Sasuke.
 But I failed…
 What did you say?
 That’s right.
 …for the likes of you?
 Are you looking to take me on?
 You willful little brat…Don’t mess around with grown-ups.
 Don’t be so arrogant.The situation is in my favor.
 It’s also been found out thatI’m a minion of the Sound.
 Then…if they find out that you’rehaving a secret meeting here with me…
 the plan to destroy the Leaf Villageand everything will be for naught!
 I heard…that you’re Orochimaru’s right-hand man.
 Being revealed to them and comingnonchalantly to meet with me…
 You must be a fool.
 Well…to be exact, my true identitywasn’t found out…
 I let them find out.
 I wanted to see how farthe Leaf Village would go…
 Even after that it wouldn’tbe too late to seize Sasuke.
 If you guys are going to fail,we’ll back off immediately…
 It’s a plan that was originallyposed by the Sound, so.
 The Sand is invisible untilthe last moment.
 This is the will of the Kazekage.
 Holy smokes…
 That’s fine.
 This is the carry-out plan from Sound.
 Okay.
 And please…tell them aboutthis plan soon.
 Yeah.
 I know.
 Okay, I’ll be going.
 To think our allied nation,the Village Hidden in the Sand,
 has been already associatedwith the Sound…?!
 I must tell Lord Hokage about this quick.
 Oh, by the way…
 I’ll take care of the clean up.
 No, I’ll do it…
 As the member of Sand Villageof the Land of Wind,
 I must do what I can for my allies…
 Besides…it’s just one mouse.
 It’ll be easy.
 Well well, it’s Mr. Proctor.
 What in the world are youdoing here alone?
 It seems I have no choice, but to fight.
 Leaf Style…
 Crescent  Moon Dance!
 I can’t pull it out.
 This technique is…the Leaf Style Crescent Moon Dance.
 Being able to manage itat such a young age.
 As expected,this village is full of talented Ninja.
 Your talent with a sword is superb.
 But, a real sword with substancecan be stopped.
 However…a Wind sword can’tbe stopped by anyone.
 Take that!
 That does it!
 Nice, nice.
 Hey…
 This is paradise.
 Hey, I said.
 Isn’t it time for you to turnthis way already?
 If you join my training,I’ll give you lots of “service.”
 P-l-e-a-s-e.
 So you finally came out…I was waiting for you.
 What?!
 Are you making fun of me?
 Right back at you.
 I’m hungry.
 Let’s get back to the inn.
 Owww, darn it!
 Okay…I’ll teach you a technique.
 Do you really mean that?
 Do you remember what I told youyesterday about the two types of Chakra?
 Huh? Yesterday’s talk?
 You know, what you said about blueand red Chakra or something.
 Oh… What about it?
 You said that when a great powercame out, you felt red Chakra.
 Yeah, it was like that.
 Try building up that red Chakra right now.
 Hmm. Even you say so…
 I’ll give it a try, but…
 How about it?
 Hmm, it’s not right.
 It’s the same Chakra as always.
 Jeez, you have no talent.
 Don’t be talking all high and mighty!
 In the first place,
 I really don’t understand thosetwo types of Chakra myself!
 Just keep trying.
 Humph… So he doesn’t understand it…himself, eh.
 It seems Naruto himself still hasn’trealized that
 the red Chakra isthe Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra.
 Well, guessing from his story…
 it seems the excitement of dangerand heightened emotion
 are the key to summonthe Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra.
 No good, not good.
 Only the usual Chakra’s coming out.
 Say, Pervy Sage…
 What the heck does the red Chakra andthe technique you’re going to teach me
 have to do with each other?
 Listen, boy.
 For the techniqueI’m about to teach you,
 the Chakra you’ve had until nowis not nearly enough.
 Therefore, you’ll have to able topull out and use the “other” Chakra
 that has been dormant withinyou at any time you need.
 But how do you know thatI have such a Chakra?
 Oh, just what I wanted to hear.
 Actually…
 it’s because I’m a sage.
 Jeez…that’s no answer.
 Anyway, the special Chakrathat only you have
 will become your greatest weapon.
 Greatest weapon?
 Not using that is like wasting treasure.
 There’s no need to forcedly dothe same training as everyone else.
 Everyone has what they’re good atand poor at.
 You have your own style.
 Your training until now, maintainingand releasing a set amount of Chakra,
 was in other words,
 training to control the suppression ofChakra so that you wouldn’t get exhausted.
 But you who have a lot of stamina
 should be about power ratherthan a cheap trick.
 You, who has two types of Chakraand doesn’t exhaust easily,
 should release the largest amountof Chakra you can
 and train to increase the absolute amountof Chakra that you can use.
 Then there are tons of Jutsuand techniques you can use.
 What, for example?
 For example…summoning Jutsuthat I’m going to teach you now.
 Summoning?
 Right.
 It’s a type of spatio-temporal technique
 where you sign a contract in bloodwith all kinds of living creatures
 and summon whenever you likewith Ninjutsu.
 Oh! That sounds awesome.Teach me quick!
 Before that…
 first, it’s necessary touse up all of your usual Chakra.
 Okay!
 Leave it to me.
 Well… So you can use theShadow Clone Jutsu.
 I have a good idea how to get ridof my Chakra quickly.
 Well, you’ve multiplied quite a bit.
 Listen up. We’re going to havea battle royal now.
 The last one left will bethe strongest me…
 We’re going to determinethe me among me!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 I see.Good thinking considering he’s stupid.
 Okay, let’s go!
 My, this is a sexually unattractive scene.
 The finale is near at last.
 Well done.
 Sure enough, I’m the strongest me.
 It looks like you’ve finally used upalmost all of your Chakra.
 Now, at last I’ll teach youthe technique.
 Oh, I’ve been waiting!
 First, I’ll show you.
 Watch carefully.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Ooh, so cool.
 Open that scroll.
 It’s a contract with thesummoning toads
 that I’ve taken over from generations.
 Sign your name in your own blood
 and stamp the fingerprints of one handin blood under that.
 Then build up Chakra in the placeyou want to summon
 and set down the hand you contracted.
 The Sign isBoar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.
 NA-RU-TO U-ZU-MA-KI.
 Okay…This is fine, right?
 It’s easier for you to releasered Chakra right now.
 So give it a try.
 I already am.
 Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Sheep.
 Ninja Art! Summoning Jutsu.
 A tadpole…
 This kid…has no talent, after all.

 No… It’s nothing.
 Okay…
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Sure enough, it won’t golike it did with Itachi, huh?
 It might’ve still beentoo soon for you…
 I’m just, getting started.Damn it! One more time!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Father!
 Hmm?
 One more time…
 One more time…Please join me.
 It’s still too soon for you.
 Even if I were to teach youfor only after a week…
 It’s not that…
 I’ve gotten…the hang of the Jutsu.
 So I want you to see it.
 Failure is not an option!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 That’s my boy.
 You’ve done well.
 From now on, improve yourselfand soar large
 so as not to bring shameto the crest on your back.
 Right!
 And…let me say one thing.
 Don’t chase afteryour older brother anymore.
 Mother…?
 Hmm?
 What does Father really think ofBig Brother and me?
 What is it all of a sudden?
 The other day, Father said to me,“That’s my boy.”
 He’d always said that onlyto Big Brother.
 So I was really happy.
 I see…Good for you.
 But lately, Father and Brotherhaven’t been getting along, so…
 I was thinking…
 that I might just bea replacement for Big Brother.
 Your older brother’s your older brother.And you are you.
 Your father cares deeplyabout you both.
 Then why does he only thinkabout Big Brother?!
 That’s not it…
 Your father has to protectthe Uchiha Clan
 as a representative of the clan.
 What about it?!
 Itachi is just bigger than youand is your elder.
 He’ll naturally be entrusted
 with that much more workfor the clan, right?
 Your father is the supervisorof the work, so…
 it might be that his eyes werelikely to go towards your older brother.
 But, this is just between us.
 When he’s with me,
 your father does nothingbut talk about you.
 He’s just always sullenand awkward, so…
 I’ll catch up to Big Brotherno matter what!
 Damn it…!
 Big Brother’s back is stillfar out of reach.
 Forgive me, Sasuke…Maybe another time.
 Clan…Clan…
 You measure incorrectlythe size of your own “vessels”
 and don’t know the depth of mine,so you grovel there.
 My “vessel” isdismayed at this foolish clan.
 I feel like…ever since that day,
 he hasn’t been the sameas he was before.
 Big Brother…
 Today, when school’s finished,
 will you join me forsome Shuriken Jutsu training?
 I’m busy.You should have Father teach you.
 But even I know that you’re betterat Shuriken Jutsu than Father is.
 You always treat me likea nuisance like that.
 Forgive me, Sasuke.Maybe next time…
 I don’t have the time tobe dealing with you today.
 You always say, “Forgive me, Sasuke,”and poke me on the forehead.
 and you say “today,”but it never happens.
 Thank goodness…he’s the same as before.
 Big Brother…
 His eyes looking backat Father that time…
 It wasn’t just an ordinary Sharingan…
 And…
 Father…?
 Hmm?
 Are there several typesof Sharingan?
 Oh…You’re already interestedin Sharingan?
 However, it's still too soon for you.
 It’s totally different fromthe Fire Style Jutsu.
 But someday, I too…!
 After all… I’m your kid, so.
 Indeed, there is a Visual Jutsuabove the Sharingan,
 the Mangekyo Sharingan.
 Mangekyo Sharingan…
 In the long history of the Uchiha,
 it’s a legendary Visual Jutsuthat only a few develop.
 And it’s said that it only openedunder a particular condition.
 A particular condition…?
 Don’t chase after yourolder brother anymore.
 I wonder what he thinks of myrelationship with Brother?
 Father…
 Why doesn’t Big Brother careabout me?
 He’s a bit peculiar…
 He’s a type of person who doesn’tcare for making friends with people.
 Why?
 Who knows…?
 Even I, his father, can’t read that boy.
 Here I spoke because I wantedmore of Big Brother’s attention.
 Father isn’t against it.
 Here, Sasuke!Your box lunch.
 I’ll watch your Shuriken practiceafter you come home.
 It’s not practice, it’s training!
 I’m off!
 That’s good…
 It’s not that Father dislikesBig Brother, after all.
 Big Brother graduated from the Academyat the top of his class at age seven.
 He learned to usethe Sharingan at age eight.
 And he was promotedto Chunin at age ten.
 But, I’ve got the same Uchiha bloodflowing inside me as he does.
 I won’t lose to him!
 You’re not gonna tell me this isthe best you can do, are you?
 You boast about your Way of Ninjaand this is all you've got?
 Are you still thinking thatI’m a member of your comrade game?
 If that’s the case, you're…
 a hopeless fool!
 Stop wasting time!
 Give me all you’ve got,
 you number one hyperactive,knucklehead Ninja!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Just as Neji said,
 it seems Sasuke’s inthe darkness right now.
 Damn it.
 He really did hit me withall his might.
 Hey Sasuke, am I not your comradeor anything anymore?!
 Don’t all those things wedid together in Squad Seven
 mean anything to you?!

 What?!
 O-Oh!
 T-That’s…
 It's the empty shell of sand!
 Lee's Hidden Strength:Forbidden Secret Jutsu!
 When did that…?!
 That’s not possible!
 While you had your eyes closedand were praying.
 What?
 For a moment, Lee stopped movingbecause of the pain in his body.
 At that moment…that’s when!
 Gaara!
 That's...!
 There’s no doubt about it – his eyes…
 He’s completely awake…
 The demon…inside him.
 Run away!
 That Bowl-Cut’s totally worn down…
 Gaara is toying with him.
 W-Why doesn’t Lee dodge?
 With Lee’s speed, he should easily beable to dodge that level of attack.
 It’s not that he doesn’t dodge,it’s that he can’t dodge.
 What?!
 What do you mean?
 The Lotus is a double-edged sword.
 What do you mean double-edged sword?
 Why do you think the Lotus isa forbidden technique?
 Well…
 The Lotus isn’t a Ninjutsu or a Genjutsu.
 It’s a Taijutsu, with that muchhigh-speed movement.
 The load it puts on a person’s bodyis beyond imagination.
 So Lee’s entire body is inso much pain right now
 that even moving is out of the question.
 Isn’t that so…
 Guy?
 But that’s…!
 He has no Ninjutsu, not evenone Genjutsu …
 Moreover, the Taijutsu he depends on,
 it’s now even less thanan average person’s …
 There’s no way he can win!
 He’s had it if this goes on…
 Lee…
 Hey, get a move on all of you.
 I’ll add another 200 laps!
 Stupid! There’s no wayyou’ll become a Ninja.
 Yes, I will.
 There’s no way a chump who can’teven use Ninjutsu can become a Ninja!
 Yes, I will!
 Whatever, but the fact that a guy likeyou without Ninjutsu or Genjutsu
 and with less Taijutsu thanan average person
 is in this Ninja academy is nonsense.
 Do you know what you’re called here?
 Hot-Blooded!
 Hot-Blooded!
 Hot-Blooded lose-
 Hey, get in line, Lee!
 Hey Lee!
 So that’s the hot-blooded losereveryone’s talking about.
 Doesn’t he look likesomeone we know?
 Huh?
 In particular…his eyebrows.
 Hmm…
 Rock Lee…
 The chump who can only performless than average Taijutsu…
 But you...
 You practiced your lessthan average Taijutsu …
 You practiced it over andover again like crazy…
 396…397…398…399…
 400…401…402…403…
 If I can’t do a log kick 500 times,then it’s 1,000 squats!
 413... 414...
 415... 416... 417... 418...!
 419... 420…
 So someone’s here before me…
 422… 423... 424...
 425... 426...
 I suppose I’ll come back…
 If I can’t do 1,000 squats,then it’s 2,000 punches!
 795… 796… 797… 798…
 He’s still at it…!
 2,000 punches!
 If I can’t, it’s 2,000 jump ropes!
 You recklessly practiced onlyTaijutsu and eventually…
 All right, you’ve all becomeGenin as of today,
 so I’d like to know whatit is you’re all aiming for!
 Yes, yes, yes, yes!
 Tenten.
 I’d like to become a powerful Ninjalike the legendary Kunoichi Tsunade!
 Hmm...
 And, how about you, Neji?
 I don’t want to answer…
 I…!
 I’d like to prove that I couldbecome a respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t useNinjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 Those are good serious eyes…
 Humph!
 You!
 What’s so funny?!
 I’m serious!
 I will become a respectable Ninjaeven only with Taijutsu!
 He should give up already…
 At this rate…
 He will simply die with Gaarajust toying with him…
 Bushy Brows…!
 Lee…
 Not yet… Not yet!
 Lee, you just won’t learnyour lesson, will you?
 There’s no way you can win…
 Unlike you, Neji is a genius.
 A genius…?
 What is a genius?!
 Even though I may not have talent,I’ll exceed genius with my efforts.
 That is my entire being!
 That is my Way of the Ninja!
 You’ll get nowhere, Lee…
 No matter how much effort you make,
 there’s no way you can take me down.
 That’s simply a fact.
 That's not true!
 That’s not…
 But you…refused to give up, not ever!
 Such meaningless actions…
 The Bowl-Cut was unlucky tohave Gaara as his opponent!
 No…
 Lee’s not one to give upwith this much.
 – What? 					– Huh?
 The reason is that Lee…
 The reason is that Lee…
 You…continued to make effort.
 If I can’t jump rope 1,200 times,I’ll log kick 2,000 times!
 1,116... 1,117...!
 1,118... 1,11--!
 Huh?!
 Lee!
 Are you taking a break already?
 Guy Sensei…
 What is it that you want?
 If it’s about my blunder withthe recent assignment,
 I believe I’ve apologized.
 Lee… It’s true you’re different from Neji.
 You have no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills,and you’re not a Taijutsu genius either…
 But Lee...
 you have powersthat exceed Neji…
 you’re a genius with hidden potential.
 If you’re trying to make me feel better,please stop!
 Idiot!
 I’m not trying to make you feel betteror anything!
 The reason is that you are…
 a genius of effort!
 I wonder if…
 If that’s true…?
 I've…I’ve believed that to be true…
 That if I trained harder than Neji…2 or 3 times as much…
 that I’d surely become stronger.
 But...
 I’ve recently begun to think that…
 I can’t beat a real genius.
 Is effort really rewarded…?
 I’ve wanted to know this and
 so I’ve taken on Neji,but it’s always been the same…!
 I’m no match for him at all!
 Even when I’m on a mission…
 My legs still tremble even now…
 I think that I’ll never becomestronger though I strive and strive…
 I am so afraid that I can’t bear it!
 What am I to do…?
 There’s no point in making the effortif you don’t believe in yourself!
 Lee, you’re very similar to me.
 Do you mean our eyebrows?
 No, not just our eyebrows…
 I was actually a failure once too…
 You were, Sensei?
 But now, I can even win againstthe genius elite Kakashi,
 because of my efforts…
 “I’d like to prove that I can becomea respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t use Ninjutsuand Genjutsu” you said.
 That’s your Ninja way, right?
 That’s a fine goal…
 It’s a fine goal worth sticking to!
 That’s why you should believe inyour path and forge straight ahead!
 Become a man powerful enoughso that I can just watch you smiling!
 Understand, Lee?!
 Yes!
 Thank you…Guy Sensei…!
 Stop, Lee!
 If you fight any more, you’ll die!
 Bushy Brows…
 What?!
 Movement has...
 ...returned to Lee!
 Sensei is smiling and watching me…
 And just because of that,I can come back stronger!
 Stronger… stronger still!
 Lee’s smiling…even thoughhe’s been driven into corner.
 No.
 It’s his turn to do the driving.
 Huh?
 The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice.
 Blossoms twice…?
 Lee said that too!
 The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice.
 When we meet the next time,I vow that I will be an even stronger man.
 No, Guy!
 You haven’t?!
 It’s exactly as you imagine.
 So that Genin…
 that boy can open the Eight Inner Gatesin his body and use the Hidden Lotus…
 The Hidden Lotus?
 That’s right …
 This is incredible…
 Guy…
 How many of the Eight Inner Gatescan that boy open now…?
 Five gates.
 What exactly is it?
 These Eight Inner Gates andthat Hidden Lotus?
 The Eight Inner Gates are“Limiter Releases”
 used in preparations forreaching the Hidden Lotus.
 A “Limiter Releases”?
 That’s right …
 In the Chakra Networkwhere chakra flows,
 there are eight places where thechakra points are concentrated
 in each area of the body from thehead area down--
 the Gate of Opening, Gate of Rest,Gate of Life, Gate of Pain,
 Gate of Closing, Gate of Joy,Gate of Shock and Gate of Death.
 These are called the Eight Inner Gates.
 These eight gatescontinually “limit”
 the amount of Chakra flowingthrough the body…
 However, the Lotus’s essence is to forcethe boundaries of these “limits” to open…
 and bring out severaltens of times the body’s strength.
 The Primary Lotus…
 opens only the first gate,the Gate of Opening,
 and releases the brains restraints
 to bring forth a person’s muscles’ strengthto its fullest!
 That’s the kind of technique it is.
 So…what is the Hidden Lotus?
 After forcing the stamina to increaseat the second gate, the Gate of Rest…
 From the third gate, the Gate of Life,one enters the Hidden Lotus!
 No way!
 Even after using just the Primary Lotus,his body was in shambles.
 So if he uses a technique beyond that…
 That’s right.
 Huh?
 By opening all the 8 gates,
 one attains strength exceedingeven the Hokage, but in return…
 one dies!
 I don’t intend to pry into what thatboy means to you
 or to tell you not to bringyour personal feelings into play…
 But there is a limit!
 I’ve misjudged you…Guy!
 What do you know…about that boy?!
 There is something important which
 that boy wants to prove andprotect even if it costs him his life.
 I’d like to prove that I can becomea respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t useNinjutsu and Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 That’s why I…
 wanted to make him a manthat could protect that thing.
 That’s all there is…
 Lee!
 I’m going to teach youa new technique.
 Yippie, yeah!
 – One that will be your trump card.– Yeah, that's great!
 Yippie, yeah! Yippie yeah!
 Lee, listen to my explanationseriously, all right?!
 Y-Yes, Sensei!
 Let me first say that...
 this is more of a forbidden Jutsuthan the Primary Lotus!
 And it will become themost special technique for you.
 Special...?
 However...
 there is one strict conditionfor using this technique.
 That is...
 That is…
 What?
 I don’t know whatyou’re planning to do…
 But this is the end for you.
 That’s true…
 In any case…it will be the end with the next.
 Neji…
 Sasuke…and…
 There is no way that I alonecan lose in a place like this!
 Guy Sensei…please allow this…!
 It is now!
 The time to carry through andprotect one’s own Way of the Ninja!
 The Third Gate of Life…open!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 When you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Effort is always rewarded.My belief in this has brought me this far.
 Neji, Sasuke, and Naruto…
 There’s no way that I can losein a place like this!
 Even though this technique ismy ace in the hole,
 I’ll show it especially to you!
 This is my ultimate secretTaijutsu technique!

 Special Report:Live from the Forest of Death!
 Chapter of Character Introduction
 Please introduce yourself.
 Okay!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
 A Ninja from Village Hiddenin the Leaves!
 My hobby is to play pranks,and I love ramen noodles,
 I’ve just become a Genin but…
 My dream is big, to become a Hokage!
 And I’m going to surpass allthe Hokage from the past,
 and make everybody in the townacknowledge my existence.
 I’ve been called a failure and such,but I graduated splendidly and,
 as a member of Group Sevenled by Kakashi Sensei,
 I am dealing withdifficult missions every day!
 Distance from the target?
 5 meters.
 I’m ready anytime.
 In Group Seven, there is alsoSasuke and Sakura.
 Since I’m really the only one that showsgreat success,
 you don’t worry about the other two.
 I got you!
 Don’t say such things.lntroduce them properly!
 Is the target correct?
 I know, I know.
 The target confirmed.
 For example, this guy’s name isSasuke Uchiha
 and he’s a pretentious guy.
 I heard that he’s one of the lastremaining of the famous Uchiha clan,
 but he really is a pitiful guy, like this…
 Oh, this was when I transform but...
 as long as you understand the greatnessof my Ninja skills that’s all that matters.
 Oh, and this is Sakura Harunowho is in love with me.
 You know, the more she denies it,the more I’m convinced it’s true.
 She hardly tells me howshe really feels about me but,
 her shyness makes her even cuter!
 Is that true?
 It really is true, true.
 Who’s in love with Naruto?!Cha!
 It was a lie after all!
 I’m sorry…
 Well, putting that aside,three of us formed a team
 and got through a bunchof dangerous missions together.
 Hey you…
 What?
 Oh, Missus!
 I’ve gotten rid of all the weeds!
 What? 					What's wrong?
 Those…those aren’t weeds…
 Huh?
 Those are herbs I grew in my garden!
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!
 Somebody! Help…!
 No!
 Free Fall!
 You idiot.
 Trap FieldDo Not Enter		Don't go over there!
 Hey! 					Please stop!
 That fool…
 Geez... All because hestubbornly chose that big dog.
 This is a dangerous mission?
 It only looks like you're being clumsy, Naruto.
 Yikes !
 Well, there were times like that too.
 Do it over.
 Transform!
 Oh, this was when I defeatedthe Old Man Hokage.
 This isn’t going to make a good article.
 Fine, then you show me how to do it.
 Fine! My name is Konohamaru…
 The grandson of thetown’s chief Hokage.
 Grandfather is the most important figurein the Leaf Village
 and is the third Hokage.
 Those who succeed the Hokage nameis the top Ninja of the village.
 Especially the 4th Hokage is a great herowho protected the village
 from the demon fox!
 Hey, hey, hey wait!
 You’re only talking about other people!
 I was just about to start on myself!
 Besides, Bro, you talk too muchabout yourself!
 Of course, I am the star of the article,other people don’t matter!
 You’re right, Naruto…
 Of course, you’re going to forgetabout me
 when you graduate from the academy.
 But you can introduce me for a bit…
 Oh, yes, yes…
 He is the first person in the townwho acknowledged me, Iruka Sensei…
 He’s a really nice person,
 he always treats me toramen noodles at Ichiraku.
 Am I just a nice person becauseI treat you to ramen noodles?
 Oh no…well…that’s…
 Don’t laugh it off!
 Big brother, next up,I’m depending on you!
 Oh, you’re right!
 Then, I guess I could talkabout Sasuke’s stories of failures…
 I’ve already heard that one.Get more serious!
 That Naruto…!
 I bet he's just making upstuff as he pleases…
 Humph!
 Who cares…
 This is good-looking Kakashi.
 How is the situation over there?
 This is cute Sakura.
 Naruto is somehow managingto fill up the time.
 More importantly, how is it over there?
 Are we going to make it in time?
 We’ll be able to deliver by theend of the commercial break, I think.
 Oh and don’t forget to tellthe viewers about the present.
 Roger that.
 Kakashi Sensei…Kakashi Sensei, please respond.
 I wonder what happened?
 He said that he’d be back bythe time the commercial ended.
 It can’t be helped.Sakura, you have to continue.
 What, me?!
 Sakura do your best!
 Why are you there?!
 Well, it can’t be helped,I guess I’ll have to do it.
 Chapter of Ninja Art
 Well, now we’ll have Sakura Haruno,
 who is my senior as a Kunoichi,teach us about Ninja Art.
 Yes, I am the beautiful Kunoichi,Sakura Haruno.
 Beautiful?
 What, you have any complaints?
 Oh, no…
 Transform!
 Well first, Naruto’s Ninjutsu...
 Sexy Jutsu,
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 Transform!
 - Transform!- Transform!
 - Transform!- Transform!
 Harem Jutsu…
 I call it, “Harem Jutsu”!
 And something like this.
 Hey!
 It’s his fault that he’s late!
 Dropping the blackboard eraser…
 Next is the number one rookie, Sasuke,
 who graduated asthe top student at the academy.
 You won’t get me by attackingstraight on.
 The most popular one in class, he canalso fight Kakashi Sensei as an equal.
 Sasuke is awesome!
 Your Sasuke introductionis taking too long.
 Naruto, you're so noisy.
 Stay quiet.
 Horse!
 Tiger!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 What?!
 That’s not a Jutsu Genin can use…
 He couldn’t have enough Chakra!
 Demon Wind ShurikenWindmill of Shadows.
 Shuriken won’t work on me.
 I’ll do it.
 C-Could that be…?
 Sharingan!
 Is that, the Sharingan…?
 If this is the same Kekkei Genkaias Kakashi Sensei’s…
 he can read Bushy-Brow’s Jutsu!
 Genjutsu or Ninjutsu…it’s some kind of magic either way.
 I’ll reveal that!
 Although you have seen Sasukeusing powerful Jutsu like
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu,Demon Wind Shuriken,
 Windmill Shadow, and Sharingan,
 the greatest of all is...
 the sharp look of his eyes!
 Any girl who has been staredat with those eyes,
 will fall in love with him!
 Sasuke! 					Look this way!
 You’re... annoying.
 Well, that cold behavior is alsoanother attractive quality of Sasuke…
 Next is our teacher,Kakashi Hatake Sensei,
 also known asthe Copy Ninja Kakashi.
 He uses the Sharingan in his eyeto assess the enemy’s technique
 and copy overa thousand Jutsu techniques.
 But he’s always late to meet people,and whenever he has any time
 he always reads this questionable bookcalled Make-Out Paradise,
 and he always looks like hedoesn’t really care about things…
 Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu:
 A Thousand Years of Death!
 And the biggest mystery of allis his face hidden under that mask!
 I wonder what he really looks like…
 Ninja Art, Summoning,Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
 If you can’t use your eyes or ears,simply use your nose.
 That’s what happens whenyou’re closing your eyes in the midst of fog.
 This is the Summoning Jutsuspecialized for pursuit.
 On top of all that, why does hehave the Sharingan in his left eye
 that is only passed on in the Uchiha clan?
 One mystery after another whenit comes to this person,
 so many things that I don’t understand…
 I should ask him next timeI have the chance.
 Lightning Blade!
 What the…?!
 His hand is…visibly overflowing with Chakra!
 You are too dangerous.
 Water Prison Jutsu.
 Oh no!
 Secret Jutsu.
 Crystal Ice Mirrors!
 Next up are the Ninjutsu ofthe other Ninjas besides us.
 There’s such a diverse collection ofNinjutsu that I have no time to explain all…
 Chapter of Rivals
 Please, Sasuke,whom I feel is like my future self,
 take care of the next part.
 Sure. After all, I have be the oneto do something about it.
 I knew that from the beginning.
 Don’t try so hard to look cool.
 Sasuke, the snob.
 Don’t interfere.
 Stay out of it, loser.
 Annoying.
 Shut up!
 I hate the fact that only you stand out.
 Nobody strong around youshows any interest in you.
 What the…?!
 Just watch this.
 Hey!
 You there…What’s your name?
 I’m Gaara of the desert.I have an interest in you as well…
 What’s your name?
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 Hey, you there.ldentify yourself.
 Dang it!Again? It's always about Sasuke!
 When asking someone his name,give your own name first.
 You, with the unpleasant look.
 Wait a minute!
 Why don’t you fight with me here now?
 I AM going to take out the Bushy-Brow.Believe it!
 The one I want to fight isn’t you…lt’s Uchiha.
 Everybody says Sasuke, Sasuke!lt's annoying!
 It’s true!
 Nobody thinks that you’rethe main character leader!
 That’s not true, they’re all just blind!
 Huh… As usual you’re just aboutthe talk and not the walk.
 That’s not true!
 Leaf Whirlwind!
 See, you are just about the talk.
 Uhh… even Sakura is picking on me.
 The students who gathered forthis Chunin Exam are all skilled,
 and are the cream of the crop…
 Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi,lno Yamanaka,
 Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka & Akamaru,and Shino Aburame…
 You won’t never be able to winwith the way you have been fighting.
 You must understand that, right?
 Y-Yeah! Of course!
 You, too. Be careful not to letyour guard down
 so you won’t be defeatedby some lame guy!
 Huh! Of course!
 That’s right…
 We passed the first stageof the Chunin Exam and
 are heading to the locationof the second stage…
 No matter what kind of adversitymay lie ahead,
 we will not be afraid!
 And we will pass the examto become a Chunin!
 Because we... we...
 have the greatest teamworkthat was formed by a strong bond!
 Okay! Let's go!
 Thank you so much for cooperatingwith the interview!
 – Thank you… 					– Leader!
 Do your best!
 Yeah leave it to me!
 – Bye! 					– See you!
 – Do your best!– Good luck!
 Oh guys… I’m sorry I’m late.
 A cute girl started talking tome on the way, and I danced for a bit.
 And that’s a lie!
 Well, don’t say that…
 I did bring the VTR like I said.
 You have to praise me.
 Yes, Kakashi Sensei you’re great!
 Now we can see the rest of the show!
 Everybody look forward to it!
 Oh, before that the commercial break…
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The 44th Training Field,also known as the Forest of Death.
 From here on it’s a serious battlebetween the Ninjas,
 anything could happen!
 It’s going down in earnest now!
 This is getting interesting!
 A life-risking survival game in the forest!
 I will survive without fail!
 Next time: “The Chunin Exam Stage 2:The Forest of Death!”
 As for me, I’m going to kick butt again!

27,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 I like your determination!
 Then…
 For those who are still here…
 The first test...
 you have passed it!
 You’ve passed through the gates!
 The first test for the Chunin Examshas been completed…
 I wish you well.
 All right! Wish us well!
 What a funny guy…
 Huh…
 I didn’t think that there would bea guy who would pass the first test
 with a blank test sheet.
 Naruto Uzumaki.He really is a funny guy.
 The Chunin Exam Stage 2:The Forest of Death!
 There’s something kindof creepy about this place.
 This place is called the Forest of Death,you’ll soon realize why.
 “The Forest of Death,you’ll soon realize why.”
 That kind of threat won’t workon me one bit!
 I’m not scared!
 Really?
 You’ve got a lot of energy.
 A kid like you dies at very beginning,
 dappled with the red blood I like.
 I’m returning your…Kunai Knife…
 Thank you for taking the trouble…
 But…don’t stand behind me,thirsty for blood.
 If you don’t want a quick death…
 Well, it’s my nature to act upat the sight of red blood.
 And my precious hair was cut,so I got excited…
 Naruto…
 I’m sorry…
 W-What with that Proctor?
 Frankly, she’s psycho!
 This one, too…
 That girl, why was her tongue so long?
 Evidently, we’ve gota lot of hot-blooded kids this time.
 This will be fun.
 You’re the most hot-blooded! Believe it!
 Well, before we start the second exam,I have to pass this out to you!
 It’s a consent form,
 before you can take partin the test you have to sign this.
 Why?
 From here on out,corpses are going to come out,
 I have to get your consent to that!
 Or it’ll be my responsibility.
 Well, I’m going to startthe explanation for the second exam.
 In a word, the limits ofyour survival will be challenged.
 Survival, huh?This test is a total pain.
 First, I’ll give you step-by-step instructionon the terrain of this Training Field.
 Training Field Number 44 is surroundedby 44 locked entrance gates,
 there are rivers and a forestand a tower in the middle.
 It’s about 10 kilometersfrom the towers to the gate…
 In this confined area, you willgo through a certain survival program.
 The contents of which are…
 anything goes scroll battle!
 Scroll…?
 Yes…
 I want you to fight for two scrolls,the Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll.
 All together 26 teams gotthrough the first test.
 Half of them...
 13 teams get the Heaven scroll,the other half get the Earth Scroll.
 I’ll hand over one scroll to each team.
 To put it simply, that’s what you’re vying for.
 And the conditions to pass?
 Three of you bring both the Heaven andEarth Scrolls to the tower in the center.
 That means that of the 13 teams,half of them will fail for sure…
 Except it has to be in time.
 For this second exam,the time limit is 120 hours.
 Do it in exactly five days!
 Five days.
 What do we do about food?
 Be self-sufficient! It’s a treasure trovein the wilderness.
 There’s more than enough for food…
 However…
 It’s teeming withfierce people-eating animals,
 poison bugs, poisonous weeds andmuch more.
 No way…
 Fool, that’s why it’s called survival!
 Besides, it’s improbable that 39 people,13 teams will pass.
 The interval for activity gets longerwith passing each day,
 while the time for recoverygets shorter…
 Seems pretty grueling!
 On top of that, you’re surroundedby nothing but enemies,
 even falling asleepwill be a problem…
 And, besides those injuredduring attempts to capture scrolls…
 there will definitely be people
 are unable to endurethe rigors of the course.
 Umm…so you can quit in the middle of it?
 According to the rules,you cannot give up in the middle of it!
 I want you to spendfive days in the forest.
 Just like I thought…
 This is going to be a pain!
 Moving on, conditions of disqualification.
 Number 1, if all three membersof the team can’t make it to the tower
 with the Heaven and Earth Scrollswithin the time limit.
 Number 2, if a team loses a memberor if a member became incapacitated.
 There’s that, and this is a supplement…
 Absolutely do not look atthe contents of the scrolls
 until you have reached the tower!
 W-What happens if we lookat it halfway through?
 When you look at it you’ll find…out!
 Huh?
 There are times when a Chuninmust deal with super-secret text.
 This is to test your reliability.
 That’s all the explanation!
 I’ll exchange your three consent forms forthe scrolls in that hut over there.
 After that, pick your entrance,and all the gates will open simultaneously!
 Finally, just a word of advice…
 Don’t die!
 I see, so you won’t know whichscroll was given to each team…
 and you won’t know which ofthe three people is carrying the scroll.
 If what Ibiki said was right,
 there will be life or deathstruggles for information in this test.
 Everyone is an enemy!
 The resolve of everyone here is strong.
 That means that it might cometo killing each other.
 It looks like they understand the meaningof the consent form a little bit…
 Heeey, look who’s here!
 It’s Billboard Brow, isn’t it?
 I thought you went home long ago,I never imagined you were still here.
 Ooooh? Look who’s here,the ugly Inopig.
 Starting now, it's five days ofthe survival test with Sasuke.
 There’s no reason to go home.
 – Ugly! 					– Billboard!
 – Ugly! Ugly!– Billboard! Billboard!
 – Ugly, ugly, ugly!– Billboard, billboard, billboard!
 – Billboard, billboard, billboard!– Ugly ugly ugly!
 – Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly!– Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard!
 Sakura, this is impossible for you.
 For your own sake,just hurry up and go home!
 I could say the exact same thing to you!
 Hey, why are those twoon such bad terms?
 D-Do you think I care aboutsomething stupid like that?
 Man…all there is to dois write my name,
 why does it take this much time!
 Hey! Hinata! What are youdoing over there?
 N-Naruto…
 Umm…uhhhh…well…
 Just like I thought,this kid is strange.
 A scratch…
 Uh-um… this…is--
 See ya!
 Naruto…
 It’s about time forthe scroll exchange.
 Well, I wonder howmany teams will survive…
 Teams who havetaken the scroll,
 stay with the representativeand move to the gate!
 We’ll all start simultaneouslyin 30 minutes!!
 Yeah! Survival is our forte!
 Hinata, don’t show your weakness.
 Uh, okay…
 Life or death…
 It’s a pain but we just have to do this.
 Since it’s come to this,Naruto will be our target.
 For snacks, there’s potato chips...
 – What about shortcake...?– I can’t believe you two!
 Okaaaay! I won’t lose!
 I’ll bring down whoever comes near me.
 – Yes! 					– Cha!
 Heh heh…finally the opportunity is here…
 We have the chance to fulfillour mission in earnest…
 Sure, the enemy teams are scary but,
 I’m really scared of spendingfive days with this guy.
 Target the rookies first.
 They said that from now onit’s okay to kill,
 which makes it easier.
 Master Guy, I’ll do my best!I’ll definitely succeed!
 We now start the secondtest of the Chunin Exam!
 Look for the brats!
 Those three, right?
 All right! Let’s go!
 Okay! First, we search for that thing.
 Can you do it, Hinata?
 Yes.
 Byakugan!
 Slow down, Lee!We just started.
 I know. But…
 I can’t stay still!
 Who knows what kind ofpowerful foe is waiting for us.
 Hot-blooded fool…
 As you already understand,we have only one target!
 W-What are you doing, Choji?
 Just a little break…I’m already tired, and hungry…
 What are you suddenly saying?!
 It hasn’t been five minutessince we started!
 But I can’t help it. I’m hungry…
 You! If you were able to bring snacks,
 you should have been ableto bring one Kunai knife!
 Ino! Hide!
 Uh-oh!
 This kind of thing continuing for five days…?
 Anyway, the tower is thegoal for everyone, right?
 So it would be clever for us to makea trap in the vicinity of the tower.
 Okay…wasting no time, huh?
 Where are they?
 Heh…kids.
 It’s like begging to be found,standing in that conspicuous place.
 They sensed our presence,
 but, evidently they haven’tgrasped where we are.
 What happened? 					You’re pale.
 W-What is that?!
 The Flying Leeches of Leaf Villagesense body temperature and perspiration,
 then in mass, swoop downon their prey.
 If they continue to suckyour blood for five minutes,
 you go to the other world…
 Using this behavior,
 we’d set a trap on the pathenemies would use to escape.
 D-Darn it…
 That’s one team gone!
 It sounds like they’ve already started.
 Wasn't that someone screamingjust now?
 I-I’m kinda getting nervous.
 I-It was nothing. Sakura.Believe it!
 I-I have to pee…
 Y-You…fool!
 What are you doingin front of a lady!
 Go to the grass!
 Aaah, that was a lot!I’m refreshed.
 Like I said, not in front of a lady--!
 S-Sasuke… no matter what,you don’t have to go that far.
 W-What was that for…?
 What are you doing…all of a sudden?!
 What you ask? That’s my line, isn’t it?
 Sasuke!
 It can’t be helped!
 Sasuke, please stop!
 Look closely at him!
 Talk! Where’s the real Naruto!
 I have no idea whatyou’re talking about!
 What happened to the scratchon you face?
 I’m asking what happened to the scratchyou got before from the Proctor!
 And your Shuriken holsteris on your left leg.
 That guy’s right handed!
 You’re worse at transformationthan Naruto, you phony!
 Unlucky! You got me.ln that case…
 Which one of you got the scroll?
 If you listen to me obediently,I’ll spare your lives.
 I see! Then I’ll resort to force!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.

 Aww, stupid gas mask man!
 Suddenly sneaking up on someonewhen they're peeing!
 I messed up just a little bit.
 Now I have to hurry andmeet up with Sakura.
 Wait a minute!What is this giant snake?
 Hey! Are you serious?!Wait a minute, hey!
 I've been gulped down!
 Next episode: ""Eat or Be Eaten:Panic in the Forest""
 Will I return to action?!

 Hey you, failure.
 I have two piecesof advice for you.
 First, if you intend to callyourself a Shinobi,
 stop that revolting cheering of yours.
 And second...
 a failure willalways be a failure.
 There's no changing that!
 Do you want to see about that?
 You!
 Naruto, I get where you'recoming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be doneofficially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted geniusthrough sheer effort…
 Wouldn't that make foran exciting main battle?
 I promise you.
 I will win no matter what!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee:The Power of Youth Explodes!
 Hey, Choji!
 You're in trouble.
 Only the strong ones are left.
 Probably the strongest of Hidden Soundmust be that bloke.
 And Lee is apparently strongenough to take on Sasuke!
 And particularly that Sand guy!
 He's probablythe most dangerous one!
 I-I don't care!
 I plan to forfeit right awayif that happens…
 So that means…
 Huh?
 ...you plan to foregoall-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then.
 What? Come on!
 Don’t worry.
 If things start getting ugly,
 I'll step in and stop the fight,like I did for Hinata. Okay?
 Prime beef tongue, short ribs...
 – You can eat what you want.– Don't dangle food in front of him!
 – Besides he didn't step in...– You can eat whatever you want...
 – and stop the fight for Hinata.– and all you want.
 B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q!All you can eat!
 He doesn't look good.
 Watching the previous fight…
 Did it get stirred up?
 His inner demon!
 I’m curious about that guy, Neji, too…
 Here's a plan.
 Kankuro?
 Just a littleinformation-gathering mission.
 Hey!
 Huh?
 What are you doing hereall by yourself?
 Shouldn't you be with your friends?
 I-It's none of your business, is it?!
 Hmmm. Well, well…
 That guy... Neji Hyuga, right?
 Well, it seems to me that
 he didn't reveal the true extentof his power in that last match.
 What's he about?
 I'm going to crush him!
 Err, that's not whatI was asking.
 Besides, this guy’s way out of his league...
 You seem like a fun guy.I quite like you.
 You're dull.And I don't like you at all!
 I'm going to waste this guy!
 We will now resume the battle.
 Okay!
 You'll be up this time for sure.Go for it, Lee!
 No!
 – Huh? 					– What?
 Seeing as I've come this far,I rather be the last!
 Is Lee sulking?
 Hurry up and get down here…
 Safe!
 – Hey!– Don't do anything misleading, idiot!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee
 Oh! Lee!
 It worked!
 If you say you want to go last,then you won't be last.
 It's an application of the same law
 that says a stone thrown to hita telephone pole will miss,
 and a stone thrown to misswill be a direct hit!
 Right! That's my student!
 I absolutely did notwant to go last!
 I threw them a beauty of a curve!
 Threw whom a curve?
 Okay, so let me give youa little piece of “nice” advice.
 Right!
 Probably no one has noticed yet, but…
 That gourd is suspicious!
 I see!
 Quit with the notes!
 You're not going to have time toread them during the match! Fool!
 I see!
 He didn't realize that?
 Wow, is Lee going to be all right?
 All right! 					Go! Lee!
 Yeah!
 I am very happy to be squaringoff with you so early in the match.
 I don't know what kind of movesthat bowl-cut guy has,
 but he will never take Gaara.
 Never!
 He's fast, to be sure,but his kick is not all that great.
 No…
 He's... strong!
 Please don't be in such a hurry.
 Lee…
 Be careful, Lee.
 Now then… The 9th match...
 Begin!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Is that…?
 Sand?
 What an unusual Jutsu…
 There's sand in his gourd!
 That's…
 That's it?
 Desert Coffin!
 Desert Burial!
 Not another horror story like that…
 A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh?
 Sounds like trouble.
 But let's give it a go!
 Even that Lee’s fast strikes…
 have no effect at all!
 What's the deal?!
 No physical strike is going tohave any effect on him.
 What?
 The Sand shields and protects Gaara
 on its own accord, independentlyof any intent on Gaara's part.
 That's why... no one has been ableto do it so far....
 Injure Gaara, that is.
 Curses! He's not movinga muscle and still...!
 Is that it?
 Entertain me a bit more…
 There's not enough yet!
 Blood!
 Why is Lee only using Taijutsu?
 He'll never be able to get closeenough for that!
 Why doesn't he step back a bit anduse Ninjutsu or something?
 It’s not that he doesn't use it.
 He can’t use it.
 Huh?
 Lee has almost no Ninjutsuor Genjutsu skills.
 N-No way!
 When I first met Lee,he was completely inept.
 He had no talent whatsoever.
 What? I can't believe that!
 Hey hey!
 Certainly…
 A ninja who can’t do Ninjutsuand Genjutsu is a rarity.
 That’s why, the only path open to Leeas a Ninja was Taijutsu.
 But! That's precisely whatmakes him a winner!
 Huh?
 Lee, take them off!
 B-But Guy Sensei...!
 You told me only to do that
 to protect a large groupof very important people!
 That’s quite all right!
 I give you permission!
 Are those…?
 Weights?
 That's some cliché training…
 I see!
 Ridiculous!
 All right, now I canmove easily!
 Humph! Does he thinkremoving some measly little weights
 is going to enable him tooutmaneuver Gaara's sand…?
 A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.
 Go, Lee!
 Right!
 Go!
 Very close!
 Fast!
 Amazing…!
 Because he can't useNinjutsu or Genjutsu...
 Therefore, he channeled allof his time,
 all of his energy and...
 all of his being into Taijutsu.
 Though he can’t do any other Jutsu…
 He won't lose to anyone…
 He is a Taijutsu specialist!
 I can't believe it!Gaara's been injured!
 No way...!
 Bushy-Brows is evenfaster than before!
 Was he this strong?!
 Youth is... explosion!
 Right!
 Over here!
 Good!
 I got him good!
 A-Amazing, he's so fast!
 The Sand Shield can't keepup with him!
 A direct hit!
 A-Amazing.
 His strikes are lightning fast…!
 I can't even track himwith my eyes!
 Uh oh…
 Uh oh is right!
 That black-circles-under-the-eyeguy is taking some serious blows!
 That's not what I meant.
 Huh?
 W-What the…?!
 His face is crumbling right off…!
 His whole body is coveredwith sand….
 There's not a scratch on him!
 W-What’s with this guy?!
 Sure enough, he wasencased in sand, eh.
 But, it's been a long time since
 I've seen that expressionon Gaara's face.
 I felt that he was becomingmore and more unstable
 as the Chunin Exam progressed…
 So Gaara's other self hasbeen awakened, eh?
 Hey! What is that?
 That protected himagainst Bushy-Brow's strikes?
 Yes… It's Sand Armor.
 Armor?
 Ordinarily, the Sand Shieldfunctions to protect him automatically,
 but, if by chance,the Shield is penetrated,
 the Sand Armor functions as a secondlayer of protection against strikes…
 That's Gaara's…absolute defense!
 Well then, there's no wayto get him!
 He doesn't have any weak points.
 No. That’s not entirely true…
 The Sand Armor is actuallyriddled with weak points.
 First of all, because it's not automatic,it uses up a lot of Chakra.
 It's also less effectivethan the Sand Shield,
 and it takes an enormous amountof physical energy
 to keep the sand clingingto the body like that.
 Gaara's having to use the armor...is proof that he's under pressure.
 That Lee is really good…
 But, the outcome of the matchis already a given.
 He will never beat Gaara!
 Is that all?
 But what an incredibledefense he has...
 no amount of speed is goingto let me get a strike through.
 I'll have to do major damagefrom above the sand guard.
 That will be Lotus!
 Yes.
 Be ready!
 A thin sand guard like thatwill be inconsequential
 in the face of Lee's high-speedLotus slamming down from above.
 Hurry up and bring it on!
 You asked for it!
 He didn’t float.
 Not just yet!
 What an amazing series of kicks!
 Even an ordinary Lotus hasa tremendous strain on the body…!
 Lee, let this be the finishing blow!
 Take this!
 Primary Lotus!
 I got him...
 good!
 Right on!
 I-It's over!
 W-What? This can’t be!
 He did it! Lee’s won!
 Hey, he isn't dead, is he?
 Wha--?!
 Huh?!
 What?!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Hey, what happened, Bushy-Brows?!
 All of your strength seemsto have disappeared!
 You're going to be destroyedat this rate!
 But, hey, Bushy-Brows is smiling!
 How can he continue to keep upa fighting stance
 when he's being routed like this?!

149,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 It’s so quiet, isn’t it?
 Peace is a wonderful thing, isn’t it?
 Being able to…drink sake tranquilly like this…
 Please, this isn’t the timeto be drinking sake!
 Especially at a time whenthe village is enjoying peace…
 you should hurry up andfinish up your work!
 Why is it that worknever seems to cease?
 That’s because you never bringa single thing to completion, Lady Tsunade!
 There’s disquiet amongthe Kamizuru Clan?
 That’s a communiqué fromthe ANBU Unit
 stationed in the Land of the Earth,isn’t it?
 That’s a name one rarely hears.
 The Kamizuru Clan are the insect handlersof the Hidden Stone Village.
 Long ago, they were so famousas to be extolled
 as equals of the Aburame Clan…
 But they’ve died out and hardly anyoneremembers their name…
 I see…
 It says there’s been some disquiet,but there can’t be many of them left.
 It’s really nothing to worry about…
 What's the difference?                   Don't All Insects Look Alike?
 Wow… There are so many insects…
 This is truly a paradise for insects…
 We won’t get stung, will we?
 Almost none of these insects willcause bodily harm to humans.
 I do have some of the Aburame Clan’ssecret recipe insect repellant…
 but I would prefer not to use it,if at all possible.
 Because it would also repelthe Bikochu.
 Then you shouldn’t havebrought it out in the first place.
 There’s no mistake…
 That kid in the lead…
 he’s a member of the Abarame Clan,after all.
 I never imagined thatwe’d bump into them in a place like this.
 Is their objective the Bikochu, Jibachi?
 Anyone who wants to get their handson a Bikochu
 has to come to this placeduring this particular period.
 The restoration of the Kamizuru Clanrests on the outcome of this mission…
 We need to get our hands ona Bikochu, no matter what!
 This is a female bikochu.
 Pound its characteristics into your heads.
 Okay!
 Got it.
 Hey, I’ve seen this thing before…
 Hey, really?!
 Where did you see it, Naruto?
 That was…
 When I inadvertently leave some food out,they start coming out of nowhere.
 A whole deluge of them…
 So those were Bikochu…
 If it’s those things,they should be easy to catch.
 Hey…
 Naruto…
 Those are called…cockroaches.
 Huh? Cockroaches?
 You're comparing apples to oranges.
 This thing is completely different!
 They look exactly identical to me…
 – They’re not!– They're not!
 Depending on how one looks of it,this could be an opportunity.
 What do you mean, Suzumebachi?
 It’s been ten days since we came here…
 we haven’t been able to getany leads on the Bikochu.
 However, that kid fromthe Abarame Clan might…
 That makes sense!
 You mean they might be ableto catch a Bikochu…
 From their appearance,it seems they're all Genin.
 If they're able to catcha Bikochu…
 we'll just take it from them.
 All insects look alike.
 Insect Summoning Jutsu!
 There aren’t any…here…
 This thing hereis different too, huh…
 Huh?
 Don’t be a burden to everyone…
 This missionis something that I suggested…
 so I will find it without fail!
 Byakugan!
 Just as I thought…
 it’s difficult to perceive thingsas small as insects.
 Huh?!
 Shino! Kiba!
 Hinata…Did you notice too?
 So…you did too?
 I guess…they think they’re hiding…
 Unfortunately for them,
 we have a whole array of specialistsin detecting enemies.
 What should we do, Shino?You’re the leader of this mission.
 If we end up in a battle,there’s the danger of involving the insects…
 and injuring the Bikochu.
 As long as they don't make a move,we'll just watch them closely.
 Got it.
 I wonder if…Naruto noticed.
 If he had noticed,he would have raised a big clamor.
 I don’t want to stir things up.So don’t tell him.
 Okay…
 Hey, Shino! Shino!
 I found it! I found it!
 I’m telling you,I found a Bikochu!
 He found it already?!
 That’s impossible!
 When we spent ten days searchingand couldn’t find one…!
 Awesome, Naruto…
 Are you sure, Naruto?
 Let me see it.
 See…this is it, right?
 It’s exactly like the photo, right?
 I might be an insect-hunting genius.
 Huh?
 Does it look the same to you?
 Huh?
 That’s called a goliath beetle…
 Huh?! It’s not the same thing?!
 Bikochu aren’t active at night.
 Which means that…
 Let’s call it a day then.
 Shino… Shino!
 I found one!This time there’s no mistake!
 It’s probably a completelydifferent insect again.
 Naruto…
 Yeah! There’s no mistake!
 Over here! Over here!
 If you don’t hurry,it’ll fly off somewhere!
 Hey, didn’t you bring it with you?
 I found one that’s resting in a tree.
 The shape of its feelers is certainlythe same as Bikochu.
 And all the characteristics match.
 They do, don't they?There’s no mistake it’s this thing, right?!
 B-But…Naruto…
 This thing is different after all, isn’t it?
 Why is that?
 It's not only size! How would you makethis one sniff scents?!
 Like this!
 This thing is calleda Fake Bikochu.
 It has an extremelyviolent temperament…
 It gets angry if one touches its noseand sometimes even eats humans…
 What?
 Huh?
 Hey, Shino! Didn’t you saythere weren’t any dangerous insects!
 Almost none… but not zero.
 Kurobachi… Jibachi…
 Do you really think they'll be ableto catch a Bikochu?
 – That might be difficult…– That might be difficult…
 Unless I control my Chakramore perfectly
 I won’t be able to find somethingas small as an insect!
 To come all this way andcontinue training…
 That’s quite admirable…
 The air pressure has changed.
 That’s a sure sign thatthe weather will change.
 Yeah, I realize that.
 A wind charged with moisturehas started blowing…
 This meansthere’s gonna be rainfall.
 When it’s such good weather?
 But I can see clouds off in the distance…
 Hinata…
 We need to hurry.
 Because it’s said that the Bikochuonly lays an egg when it rains
 and larva emerges from the eggthe following morning.
 In other words,
 if it rains today, it'll becomea mature larva tomorrow morning.
 In view of the season,this may well be our last chance.
 If this chance slips by,
 it will become impossible to searchfor Sasuke using a Bikochu…
 Sasuke…
 It’ll be fine.I’ll find it without fail!
 Don’t rain… Don’t rain yet!
 Damn! Where is it?!
 Please come on outbefore it rains!
 Naruto…
 What are we gonna do…
 if those guys don’t finda Bikochu, Suzumebachi?
 It was the Aburame Clan
 who was the catalyst inthe downfall of the Kamizuru Clan…
 In order to avenge our clan'slongstanding grudge…
 we will finish them off!
 Those guys…They haven’t made a move yet.
 They must know that we’re searchingfor the Bikochu.
 Which means that they must be waitingfor us to find one.
 I see…So their plan is to steal itfrom us once we’ve found one...
 What cheapskates…
 Rain…
 Not this one either!
 Damn! When I told it not to rain!
 There's no more time…
 Don’t be a burden to everyone…
 So ultimately…I contributed nothing.
 There’s still plenty of time!
 Naruto…
 I will not go back on my word…That’s my Way of Ninja!
 That’s right…
 This mission is somethingI suggested!
 When Naruto hasn’t given up,what’s up with me giving up?!
 Hinata!
 This rain may bevery advantageous to you.
 What do you mean?
 When the surrounding temperature cools,
 living creatures becomeeasier to discern.
 Naruto, I won’t give up either!
 Byakugan!
 I have to…I have to concentrate more…
 I need to… I need to…control my Chakra!
 I can see them!So those are insects!
 That insect…is wrong…
 This insect is wrong too.
 That’s…!
 There it is!
 Naruto! On the side of that tree!There’s a Bikochu there!
 I caught it!
 We did it…!
 I did it! I caught it!
 There’s no mistake.lt’s a female Bikochu.
 – Yes! I did it! 					– Cripes…
 Your tenacity amazes me, Naruto!
 That’s so great, Naruto!
 Hinata! It’s thanks to you!
 Naruto…is…hugging me…!
 What’s the matter, Akamaru?
 All right! It’s an egg!
 It laid an egg, huh…
 Really?
 It will emerge by tomorrow…
 So then we should make itrecognize Sasuke’s scent, right?!
 Sasuke… I’ll find you without fail!
 It looks like they finally found one…
 The time has come, hasn’t it?
 Yeah…
 That Naruto… He suddenly…
 pressed his face so close to mine…
 So…you were ableto dodge that one just now.
 That was pretty well donefor a Genin.
 They’re the ones who’vebeen trailing us all this time…
 However, I wonder if you’ll be ableto escape from this attack?
 Ninja Art…Honey Jutsu!
 Bees?!
 No… that’s…!
 It looks like you’ve noticed, huh.That’s honey.
 Honey that adheres like a bonding agent!
 I used up all my Chakra earlier…
 That thing is a real bee.
 Naruto…
 What do you think, Akamaru?
 I see…
 I was convinced that those guyswould make some kind of move.
 There hasn’t been any signof them since earlier on…
 There’s a possibility thatwe’ve overlooked something.
 Hey, Naruto!
 Huh?
 Where’s Hinata?
 She said she was gonnago wash her face.
 Hmm…
 But it’s been quite some time.I wonder what she’s doing?
 Could it be that…?!
 Huh? What?
 – Naruto! 					– Wha--?!
 A letter on a Kunai?
 Huh?!
 We are holding the Kunoichibrat hostage.
 If you want to get her back,
 it’ll be in exchange forthe Bikochu.
 Come to the top ofthe eastern hill later tonight.
 Damn! So that was their move!
 Hinata…!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 Damn! We've run out of options!
 It's too soon to give up.
 But we don't even knowwhere Hinata is?!
 No, there's one place Hinatais sure to appear.
 I get it! The place wherethe exchange will take place!
 We have one chance.
 Awright! I'll do it!
 I'll protect Hinata andthe Faint Scent Beetle without fail!

 Dang it!
 A Shirker’s Call to Action:Layabout No More!
 Hey! Hurry it up, you guys.
 Huh? What is it?
 Did you find Sasuke?
 No!
 There are eight people intwo squads behind us…
 No…
 There’s one more…There are nine people following us.
 What?!
 C’mon. Already?!Give me a break!
 It looks they haven’t graspedour location, yet.
 We must lose them.
 Hey, what’s the point of stopping?!
 Shut up and follow me!
 Huh?
 We’re going back over our footprints.
 If we do that,
 it’ll look to them like our footprintssuddenly disappeared.
 But, they’ll notice evenif we do this, right?
 It’ll buy us some time.That’s enough.
 It’ll be a matter for great celebrationif our pursuers get impatient,
 cloud their eyes of pursuitand lose sight of the trail.
 Hurry!
 There’s no time.
 I-I know!
 This is not good.
 Though they're onalert for ambushes,
 they’re catching up with usslowly, but surely.
 Dang it!
 Probably they’re all Chunin or higher.
 We’ll be wiped out if they catch up.
 Wiped out…
 Dang it! Since it’s come to this,why don’t we ambush them?!
 Ambush?
 Right.
 Indeed, an ambush wouldbe to our advantage.
 Even if the opponent has twicethe people than we do,
 if we just catch them off-guard…
 That’s no good.
 Our opponents are formerLeaf Shinobi Orochimaru’s henchmen.
 In the worst case scenario,there might be Jonin.
 I thought it’d work,but I guess not, huh.
 Hold it. Why?
 The level of opponent doesn’t havemuch to do with an ambush.
 What do you mean?
 You guys don’t get it.
 Listen. Indeed, an ambush isa very advantageous fundamental tactic.
 But two conditions are necessary.
 What are those necessary conditions?
 Number one.
 The ones on the run must act withoutmaking noise and find the enemy first.
 Number two.
 One must be able to catchthe pursuers off guard,
 capture a point and positionto be able to inflict certain damage,
 and conceal oneself quickly.
 Ah… Huh?
 An ambush only becomes effectivewhen these two conditions are ensured.
 Well, the first conditionwon’t be so difficult
 since we have the Ninja Hound’s nose.
 And the second one alsoseems advantageous at a glance
 since we know the geographyof our village.
 But Orochimaru has spent timein the Leaf before.
 That approach won’t workon his henchmen.
 So what do you really mean?
 Our pursuers must have been instructedin the terrain of this village
 and have gone throughsimulated practice for this fight.
 And on top of that,
 they’re probably all Ninjawho have mastered the pursuit arts.
 So they know what cards we have, huh.
 Well, even so, the fact remainsthat an ambush is advantageous.
 But there are too many elementsof uncertainty.
 In the first place, the enemy isa special unit organized for this operation.
 But we have a fool…
 a Kunoichi who’s nothing special…
 and one dog…
 and, me with the number-one cold feet!
 A tactic is grasping the conditionsthat are there without fail
 and formulating an optimal plan.
 And so, there’s only one thingthat we can do now…
 One?
 A diversion in the guiseof an ambush.
 One person will remain,pretend to ambush,
 and delay the pursuers.
 In other words…
 bait.
 Right. If we delay them,
 they won’t be able to graspthe positions of the remaining three.
 If we do that, we’ll be ableto shake off our pursuers,
 but the one who has becomethe bait will probably…
 die.
 So, who’s going to do it?
 We need the dog to follow Sasuke.
 That means…
 Fine…
 – I'll…– I guess it has to be me.
 Shikamaru?!
 W-Why you?!
 It’s better than being wiped out, right?
 Besides, among us,
 the only one who is equalto playing the bait
 and who has the possibilityof surviving…
 is me.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu is an Artoriginally intended as a delay tactic, so…
 Well, I’ll catch up later!
 Now get going!
 We’re counting on you, Shikamaru!
 Sakura!
 Yeah.
 Was Shikamaru ever this reliableof a character?
 Be careful…
 Shikamaru.
 No matter how much you try to erasethe signs of your presence…
 you’re in plain view.
 Hey! The enemy is approaching fast.
 What did you say?!
 I wonder if he’s reallydelaying the enemy.
 Me with the number-one cold feet!
 Don’t tell me, Shikamaru…
 Shikamaru will be okay!
 Don’t tell me, he ran away.
 I said he’ll be okay!
 What’ll be okay?!
 He has a dirty mouth andalways says stuff is a pain.
 But he wouldn’t betray us!
 He hardly ever sayshe’ll do something himself,
 but he makes sure to do itif he says it!
 That’s absolute.
 I want to believe…I want to believe, but…
 Pick up the pace!
 I somehow managed toget away completely.
 Their strides are irregular.
 Urgency is probably increasingtheir fatigue.
 Sorry about that.
 I was supposed to be the guywith the number one cold feet.
 It seems my character haschanged just a bit this time.
 The fact that I’m tired is true.
 Those footprints are wrong.
 By the way, this is whatthe dog’s paw print really is.
 Oh, he’s still a kid.
 To think we’d all get caught like this.
 So this is the rumored Leaf Village’sShadow Paralysis Jutsu, huh?
 That’s an old way of saying it!
 The times are passing!
 It’s called Shadow Possession Jutsu now,old man.
 Sure enough,that match wasn’t good.
 I used too much Chakra.I can’t hang on much longer…
 1, 2, 3, 4…
 5, 6, 7…8.
 Eight people…
 Eight… No, there’s one more…
 There are nine people following us.
 Sure enough, the ninth person’s role isto protect against them getting ambushed.
 That person stays at a fixed distance,
 moves in the back and respondsto an enemy attack.
 But…this will make clear wherethat person’s hiding!
 There, huh?!
 Dang it… The Shadow won’t reach.
 I don’t have the stamina tosend it to Chakra.
 It’s futile. I see through your technique.
 Is this as far as it goes?
 It looks like you’re at your limit…
 This Shadow Possession Jutsuis going to break very soon.
 Prepare yourself!
 I wanted to…become a Ninja any which way,
 save up money any which way,
 get married any which way toan ordinary woman
 who’s neither beautiful nor ugly
 and have two kids any which way.
 First will be a girl, and then a boy…
 I would retire from being a Ninjawhen my eldest daughter marries
 and my son becomes a full-fledged man.
 And then I take it easyin my life of retirement
 playing Japanese chessand Go the whole day.
 Then I die of old age before my wife.
 Such a life would’ve been nice.
 I was out of character,I tried too hard this time.
 I wanted it to end in an ordinary way.
 What I did was a drag…
 Hmm, the movements ofour pursuers have stopped.
 Yes! The delaying was a success!
 Shikamaru, eh?
 I’m sorry I doubted you, even a little.
 Okay!
 Now…you wait, Sasuke.
 And…Shikamaru…
 Live, and catch up to us no matter what!
 As you say, it seems I’m at my limit.
 Hey, come on out.
 While you’re at it, cut off his head.
 I finally caught up.
 A-Asuma?! Why?
 Well done, Shikamaru.
 Sure enough, out of character.
 For the time being, you retire here.
 Hurry!
 What a pest.
 The pursuers have increased?Two? No, three?
 Kankuro! Pick up the pace!
 Okay.
 I won’t let you get away.
 Don’t jump the gun, Sasuke.
 Sasuke.
 Now then, shall we begin?
 Everyone makes mistakeslt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
 So many regretsDon’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chestYes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes It’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 I don’t know what’s going on!
 Why is Old Man Hokagefighting with Orochimaru?
 Why is Sasuke going afterthat guy with shadows around his eyes?
 I don’t understand why we haveto go after him,
 but that’s what we have to do right now!
 Wait up, Sasuke!
 Next time: “An Unrivaled Match:Hokage Battle Royale!”
 What the heck’s happeningto the village?!

 The Leaf's Handsome Devil!
 Blast!
 No matter how many times you try…
 it’s the same!
 I’ll acknowledge you.
 You’re not only sharp…
 You’re also very determined…
 In addition, I’m nice, too…
 Striking a helpless womanis against my policy…
 But however I look at it,
 you don’t have the feel ofa helpless woman…
 in your case!
 Don’t be getting full of yourself
 just because you releasedthe Genjutsu, you little clod…!
 She’s still not completely bound.
 Damn it…
 I can’t lose!
 A little more…
 What Chakra she has?!
 Even if I bind herat point-blank range,
 she still pushes back…
 But , I’ll get hammeredfor sure if I let go now.
 After all, I just have to put thisto rest with this Jutsu.
 Hang in there, Akamaru!
 Damn it… What’s going on?!
 Damn it!
 One more…to go…
 This guy’s crazy strong…
 Not a single hit with thatmany shadow clones…
 It’s about time…
 I’ve been eagerly waiting.
 Lord Orochimaru’s ambition…The first step…
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke! What’re you doingwith these guys?!
 Come on! We’re going home now!
 Sasuke…
 Hey…
 Should we go home?
 Yeah!
 We’ve both made it to the top!
 I want to fight you too.
 Hey… We’re going home.
 Everyone’s worried about you.
 So…
 Sasuke!
 Please. Bring back Sasuke…!
 You can hear my voice, can’t you?!
 Wait, Sasuke!
 It’s futile…
 Die.
 Who’re you?
 The rejuvenated…
 Leaf Village’s Handsome Devil…
 Rock Lee!
 B-Bushy Brow…?
 Bushy Brow, you!What about your body…?
 More importantly, Naruto.Go get Sasuke.
 But…you…
 Please leave this person to me!
 This guy’s…good…
 Bushy Brow! Be careful!He uses his own bones to attack.
 Bones…you say…?
 He’s crazy strong…
 What’re you doing?!Please go, quickly!
 Naruto…
 You also promised Sakurawith a “nice-guy pose,” right?!
 I’ll bring back Sasuke, no matter what!
 It’s a promise of a lifetime!
 This person…I’ll beat him!
 I promise!
 Right!
 I won’t let you!
 Die.
 Please don’t ignore me!
 Oh…
 Bushy Brow…
 You don’t have the timeto be inattentive!
 Good response!
 However…
 If Sasuke is inside that coffin…
 It’d be totally impossible to take themon with a Genin team…
 We Jonin are in this plight….
 We should organize a special teamand send them out for backup.
 We can’t do that…
 Ever since Orochimaru’s attack,
 the Leaf is currently losing strengthas a great land.
 You understand that the Joninand Chunin are being totally mobilized
 in order to take out possible domesticand international dangers.
 Even if the Sharingan were to fallinto Orochimaru’s hands…
 We should now prioritizeavoiding war with other lands.
 But… I’m sure the Orochimaru situationisn’t a problem that can be deferred forever.
 If he regains power…He’ll promptly attack again…
 I know…
 I’m not such a fool.
 I was sure to think about it andmeasures have already been taken.
 In here!
 What’s wrong, Guy?You’re on the brink of exhaustion.
 Did something happenon your mission?
 No… I took care of the missionand ran back with all of my might…
 More importantly…
 Lee! What happened withLee’s surgery?!
 It was a success.
 He can start training starting tomorrowif it’s just for Jutsu.
 Well, bed rest for a whilewould be best though.
 Th-There’s trouble, Lady Fifth Hokage.
 Rock Lee is gone!
 No!
 Next will be the end.
 Damn it… Last night whileI treated Genma and Raido?
 Lee…
 That fool… He went after them.
 And…he must’ve been really flustered…
 He took my bottle of sake fora bottle of medicine by mistake….
 SAKE
 Sake?!
 Uh…Uh-oh…
 What’s wrong, Guy?
 Actually, when Lee drinks evena little bit of alcohol…
 Things get…so messy…
 Get so messy?
 Severe Leaf Hurricane!
 He’s agile… My kicks don’t hit.
 You’re flexible toa surprising extent…
 And you make unique movements, eh?
 You’re too…straight forward.
 It’s over…
 Please wait!
 I’m sorry.lt’s about time for my medicine!
 I have to be sure to drink it, so…
 Excuse me a moment.
 I’ve always disliked medicine.
 It…happened before whenI took him to a restaurant
 to celebrate his acquisitionof the “Hidden Lotus.”
 Lee mistook my sake for water…
 As soon as he drank justa small cup…
 of the sake, things got ugly…
 Got ugly…?
 After a silence that was likeright before a storm…
 The moment I realized it,
 the restaurant…
 had gotten all messed up…
 Medicine always tastes stran…
 What…? What did this guy drink?
 Messed up?What do you mean?
 He’s terribly….!
 Lady Tsunade… Lee goes into
 an incredible drunken frenzy!
 Huh…?
 Who the heck are you?! Hey!
 Geez, who are you anyway?
 Acting cool… So irritating…
 Hence, he’s a natural user of…
 Drunken Fist!
 Sasuke!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 You fell for it, didn’t you?!
 How about my strategy?
 This is the Shinobi Secretof reading the double bluff!
 Guy Sensei! I did it once again!Yeah!
 But, what’s this?!The world is oddly…
 f-floating,and I’ve no inclination of losing!

 This isn’t good!
 Oh no, Gamatatsu!Let’s get out of here!
 What? Why, why?
 It doesn’t matter, just hurry up!
 Manda and Orochimaru,Katsuyu and Tsunade…
 They all bring back memories…
 Shall we have a reunionor something, Jiraiya?
 Fool! I summon you after a long absence
 and you make these boring jokes.
 The time to conclude this long,fateful confrontation has come.
 I'm bringing Orochimaru down,here and now!
 Hey Orochimaru…
 Why'd you have to summon meto a place like this?!
 You… I’m going to eat you up!
 Don’t say that, Lord Manda…
 You will be duly rewarded.
 Who said I'm talking to you?!
 Don’t be so flippant, brat!
 Hey, Orochimaru…
 I expect you to preparea sacrificial offering of 100 people later.
 Though Lord Orochimaru isManda’s master,
 if Manda learns that Lord Orochimarucan’t use Jutsu,
 Manda will no doubtdouble-cross him.
 Despite the fact that he hadno other choice, in his condition,
 it was too risky for Lord Orochimaruto summon Manda.
 Katsuyu… take that kid to Shizune!
 Yes, ma’am.
 All right! I can fight, too!
 Shizune, please take care of this child.
 Naruto…
 Also, the battle is going to getquite vicious from now.
 Please go far away with my cloneand conceal yourself…
 That’s what Lady Tsunade wants.
 Lady Tsunade…
 You…
 I’ll hang you out until you’re dry!
 I’ve been wanting a snakeskin wallet…
 Orochimaru,you’ve sunk too deeply into vice!
 We are no longer comrades.
 Comrades?
 That word makes me shiver.
 Today is the last day thatwe are called Sannin!
 Acid Slime!
 I’ll start with this one!
 Katsuyu!
 Lady Tsunade…
 Here they come!
 I know!
 Tsunade! Stay away!
 Bunta! Give me some oil!
 Okay!
 Fire Style!
 Toad Oil Flamethrower!
 Humph… How’s that?
 Did it work?
 No, that’s…
 Molten skin! He shed his skin!
 Bunta! Under the earth!
 What?!
 It’s the tail?!
 Keep it shut!
 They're Sannin, all right.
 Dealing with two of them is rough.
 Tsunade!
 Well now, I can kill youby wringing your neck.
 My Chakra…
 At this rate…
 Even though you sayyou won’t die in battle,
 you won't have a choice ifI rip your neck off…
 Right, Tsunade?
 How many minutes…
 How many seconds can I hold on…?
 I have to put it on the line!
 Fine!
 It’s about time we put an end to this!
 R-Ridiculous!
 Not done yet!
 Take this!
 Darn it…!
 Lady Tsunade… Not that…!
 She’s reached her limit…
 No…
 This guy…
 I’ve hurled him around that much,yet he’s still…
 So this is as far as you can go.
 Shut up!
 Don’t rest!
 Keep beating him.
 This is the battle…
 where I put my life on the line!
 Lord Orochimaru!
 I won’t let you go!
 You will stay with me until the end!
 Take this!
 I hit him and hit him.Something’s different…
 What is it?This…strange sense of discomfort?
 However, with this…!
 It’s over!
 He took a direct hit!
 That was it.
 Yeah…
 Lord Orochimaru…
 Putting me in this position!
 I want to eat you and kill you,
 but I can’t even chew you upwith this hole in my mouth…
 Next time, if we meet again,be prepared!
 Tsunade…
 Even though you won’t heal me,I still have one way.
 A way to resurrect these arms.
 The Leaf Village…I’ll destroy it…without fail.
 At that time, it would be niceif we could meet again…
 My comrades…Tsunade and Jiraiya.
 That face…?!
 In some way or another,he took someone else’s body…?!
 No wonder,when we went at it a while ago,
 I didn’t get the same feelingfrom him that I did in the past…
 The true elixir of life.
 That’s my…
 my immortality!
 Some day, in the future…
 Wait!
 The bones in my ribs and feetare broken…
 The side effects of the Jutsuare starting…
 My body is…already…
 Tsunade, you haven’t changed.You’re no good at wagers.
 The Hokage is my dream!
 I’ll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 I’ll acknowledge that you havewhat it takes to become the Hokage…
 and give you this necklace.
 It's no joke!
 If I have three days,I’ll master this Jutsu!
 Men don’t go back on their word!
 I’m the grandson of the Hokage whobuilt the Village Hidden in Leaves, so…!
 You said it.Men don’t go back on their word!
 Right! I’ll become just like Grandfather.And the Hokage name will be mine!
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 I love this village and my comrades.
 So I want to protect them.
 An existence that protects everyone.
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream…
 I’d like you… to take this.
 Any time now, the side effects…
 Lady Tsunade…
 You…
 It's nothing… If I rest a bit, I’ll returnto my young form.
 I’ll rest in town.
 And when Naruto wakes up,We’ll return to Konoha.
 Tsunade…
 Starting now, don’t call me Tsunade.Call me…
 The Fifth Hokage?!
 Old Lady Tsunade isthe Fifth Hokage starting today…
 What, you look disgruntled, Naruto.
 After all, compared to the old man,the Third Hokage,
 there’s something…
 rough-natured and kind of selfish…
 loose with money, catty and stupid…
 Somehow, I’m going to worryif she can do it properly.
 Lady Tsunade, would you liketo order something…
 Moreover, a 50-year-old ladytransforming into a young lady…
 Is it okay for the person whowill become Hokage
 to lie to everyone, I wonder…?
 Go outside, brat!
 It’s just like before…
 Despite how I look,I’m going to be the Fifth Hokage.
 I shouldn’t takethis short brat of a foe seriously…
 This one is enough…
 Don’t call me brat!
 I may be like this now,but I’ll be Hokage some day!
 Here I go!
 Another brow flick?!
 Become a fine man…
 and, a fine Hokage.
 Yeah!
 Okay! Shall we go home?
 To our hometown the Leaf Village!
 What? I haven’t eaten yet…!
 Don’t try to distract me by laughing!
 Nawaki… Dan…
 the boy who will inherit your dreams,my beloved ones,
 is right here!
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 Yahoo! Here we areat a hot spring spot!
 While Pervy Sage is gawking at women,and Old Lady Tsunade is out somewhere,
 I'm gonna relax and enjoy myself!

 What do you mean bymonitoring Akamaru?
 You know about the incident
 where someone from outsideinfiltrated the village, right?
 Yeah, I know about that.
 But I heard that Kiba and the othersresolved that incident without any trouble.
 That’s right.
 Damn! That Kiba!
 I want a mission whereI totally kick an enemy’s butt.
 To be exact, that’s wrong.
 What?
 Before Kiba and the othershad the intruder in custody…
 he swallowed a pelletand killed himself.
 What? Suicide…?
 In the investigation that followed,
 it was revealed that the enemywas a Shinobi
 from another land that usesa unique tactic.
 Perhaps he took his own lifein order to seal that power.
 What’s the “unique” tactic?
 Something you would calla biological weapon.
 Biological weapon?
 It’s a particular pathogen…
 a terrible weapon where someoneinfected will gradually lose oneself
 and have their body taken over.
 But how is that connectedwith monitoring Akamaru?
 Could it be that Akamaru was…?!
 There’s a possibility he’s infected.
 He still doesn’t look so well.
 Y-Yeah…
 Since Akamaru’s notin his best condition,
 I’m skipping training today as well.
 Okay…
 Oh!
 Wh-What’re you doing, Shino?!
 Shino, do something quick!
 Shino!
 The insects suddenlystopped listening to me.
 Jeez, give me a break.
 I’m sorry.
 We’ll head back earlyfor the time being. See ya.
 I hope… Akamaru gets better soon.
 Shino?
 It’s the first time the insectshave attacked a comrade…
 What is it, Akamaru?
 Oh, shoot! I’ve been spotted!
 What’re you doing, Naruto?
 Wh-What, you ask?
 I’m developing a new Jutsu,believe it!
 So as for me, I’m busy and…
 Kiba's Long Day
 Is there no mistake, Sis?
 I’d say the possibilityat this point is around fifty-fifty.
 I still haven’t been able to identify it,
 but these are the lab results ofthe blood drawn from Akamaru…
 But! It could be some kind of mistake!
 Do you think I, a veterinarian,would make such a mistake?
 Yeah… You’re right.
 What is it, Akamaru?!
 Let go! Let go!
 Akamaru, it’s Naruto. It’s okay to let go.
 Hey, Akamaru!
 Akamaru!
 What did you do that for Akamaru?
 I mean, what’re you doingin the front yard of my house?
 Huh? Well, that’s…
 Anyway, come in.
 For the time being, I have to fulfillmy responsibility as the owner.
 What?
 What?!
 Geez! Biting a comradeof the same village can’t be allowed!
 Are you training him properly, Kiba?!
 All right.
 It’s finished! Perfect ifI do say so myself!
 Sis! That looks just likea surgical scar!
 What? Really?I thought it turned out well, though…
 Sorry, Naruto.
 Have Sakura or someonepatch them up for you!
 Hm? Right…
 See ya.
 Right.
 See you later too, Miss Hana!
 Akamaru…
 I’m telling you,
 there’s nothing else other thanmy pants getting all torn up.
 Shino’s insects attacked Akamaru…
 He even attacked Naruto, whomhe should know very well.
 There’s trouble, Lady Tsunade!
 It seems they were attackedby someone
 in the middle of night training.
 Looks like they launcheda sneak attack with quite a few men.
 No, it seems there was just one culprit.
 What?! All of this by one person?!
 To be precise, that’s not correct.
 It’s one animal.
 There’s no doubt.
 There’s trouble, Kiba!
 You’re talking about the incident
 where Shinobi were attacked duringnight training last night, right…?
 It-It can’t be!
 It seems it’s as you said, Sis…
 I can smell blood from Akamaru.
 That’s Kiba Inuzuka’sNinja Hound Akamaru, correct?
 You jerks.What do you want with Akamaru?!
 A warrant…?
 Kiba…!
 Yes, there’s no mistake.
 Kiba Inuzuka, by order of the Hokage,
 the Ninja Hound Akamaru is to be kept
 under the supervisionof the Anbu Black Ops.
 – Damn it! 					– Kiba!
 We should obeythe Lady Hokage’s order.
 Damn it!
 Akamaru…
 Here.
 Thanks, Sis.
 This contains medicine that I prepared,
 so give it to the vet over there.
 Right. I’m off, then.
 Naruto…?
 What’s the idea of Akamarubeing detained?!
 Akamaru is the culprit fromlast night’s incident.
 We have sufficient proof as well.
 At this point, it’s an unavoidable measure.
 The Medical Team is now desperatelylooking for a way to save Akamaru.
 Don’t worry too much.
 If…that doesn’t work either,what’ll happen to Akamaru?
 At that time…
 there’ll be nothing left to dobut to put Akamaru down!
 Hidden Leaf Veterinary Hospital
 You don’t need to worry.
 The Medical Corps will figuresomething out soon.
 Right…
 Take care on your way home.
 Right.
 Akamaru…
 I won’t hand you over to anyone.
 It seems Kiba Inuzukahas taken Akamaru and fled.
 Lady Tsunade, what shall we do?
 In preparation for the worst,
 have the Special Pursuit Corpsstand by here!
 The Special Pursuit Corps…
 C-Could it be that you’re reallygoing to kill Akamaru…Grandma?
 Grandma Tsunade!
 It’s hard for me, too.
 Damn it!
 Did you find them?!
 No!
 Kiba!
 Kiba!
 He’s rapidly getting worse.
 Akamaru!
 Where are they?
 They should be around here.
 I swore to protect him,no matter what!
 I swore never I’d never let him go throughthat experience ever again…!
 The Special Pursuit Corpshas assembled.
 Show the team in.
 Kiba!
 Where are you?!
 I guess I was able to hidemy tracks somewhat…
 This is a serum for Akamaruthat the Medical Corps whipped up.
 I can’t guarantee the level of effect.
 There’s maybe a fifty-percent chanceof survival.
 There’s also a risk of side-effects
 that would cause Akamaruto go even more berserk.
 In the event that happens…
 It’s an unavoidable measure,but Akamaru must…
 Reporting!
 The Akamaru Pursuit Corps haslost the trail of Kiba and Akamaru.
 Lady Tsunade.
 That way?!
 Akamaru…
 Kiba!
 Wh-What’s that?
 It’s Akamaru…
 But…
 I won’t hand over Akamaru to anyone!
 What’re you doing?!
 Have you come to kill Akamaru?!
 No! I just came out of concern!
 You lie! The Lady Hokage said it,didn’t she?!
 There’ll be nothing else to dobut to kill Akamaru.
 You came to dispose of Akamaru, right?!
 I won’t hand over Akamaruto anyone!
 This isn’t the timeto be doing that!
 Something called the Special Pursuit Corpsor whatever is coming after Akamaru!
 What?!
 The Pursuit Corps shouldbe here soon.
 Akamaru will really bein trouble if that happens!
 You and I have to dosomething before that!
 This isn’t the time to be fighting!
 Shut up!
 Why don’t you get it, Kiba?!
 Shut up!
 All right! I’ve sighted Akamaru!
 Kiba, Naruto! You guys step back!
 C-Could it be…the Pursuit Corps is…
 Sis!
 You gotta be… joking, right?
 Sis!
 What’re you going to doto Akamaru with that?
 This is medicine I receivedfrom the Hokage.
 I’m going to inject it into Akamaru.
 Then Akamaru will be saved?!
 The probability is fifty-fifty.
 If it fails and side-effects are produced,
 Akamaru’s symptoms willget even worse.
 All we can do now is takea chance on this.
 If the worst happens and it fails…
 You understand, right, Kiba?
 Damn it…
 Even if it’s only fifty percent,
 there’s a possibility that Akamaruwill be saved.
 We’ve gotta do this!I’ll also help out, miss!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Kiba, what about you?!
 If you’re not going to do anything,you’re in the way, so beat it!
 Let’s go, Kiba.
 Just leave that coward be.
 You’re ready, right?Let’s go, Naruto!
 We’ll save you now, Akamaru!
 Aim for the legs!lmmobilize Akamaru!
 Right!
 Since it’s come to this,I have no choice.
 I must terminate Akamaru.
 Stop!
 I said stop… Akamaru.
 Kiba!
 Kiba?
 Akamaru…
 Have you forgotten…my scent?
 We were always together fromwhen we were little, weren’t we?
 Akamaru…
 Why…why…did you become like this?
 Please remember… Akamaru!
 Kiba!
 I'm sorry, Akamaru…
 I put you through nothing butpainful experiences.
 I’m sorry, Akamaru…I couldn’t protect you…
 I’m sorry… Akamaru…
 I'm a terrible master.
 But…
 I’ll…always be with you.
 Kiba…
 Kiba!
 It really would’ve been touch and go
 if the Medical Corps had beeneven a little late in arriving.
 Without a doubt,
 he would’ve lost his life if Akamaru’s attackhad hit Kiba’s vital spot…
 Really, it could have beenmuch worse.
 That’s wrong…
 Huh? Kiba?!
 When he came at me withhis final attack,
 Akamaru just barely missedmy vital spots.
 He drained all his remaining strengthin order to desperately control himself.
 Akamaru was battling desperatelywith himself.
 That’s admirable, Akamaru!
 Thanks…
 Akamaru.
 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 In this world, there remain mysteriesyet unsolved.
 We came to the Hidden Leaf Villagein search of mystery
 and encountered a successionof hair-raising terror.
 However, we charge forwardwithout being daunted
 by the forest that bares its fangs.
 And then at last…!
 We witness with our own eyes,
 the creature of the legend handed downfrom generation to generation.
 Next time:“A Legend from the Hidden Leaf:		The Onbaa!

36,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 I’ve…had it…
 Oh, Sakura!
 For crying out loud,how far have we walked?
 The tower hasn’t gotten a bit closer.
 Here we can see itright in front of our eyes.
 Strange…
 No mistake about it.
 It seems that we’re already withinthe enthusiastic welcome.
 Take a look at that.
 Huh?
 Oh, that can’t be!
 What on earth is going on?!
 No way!
 Is it Genjutsu…?
 So it seems.We were lured in perfectly.
 It appears we were meticulously careful,
 and were made to walkaround the same place in a circle.
 We’re being watched…
 Probably.
 They intend to wear downour physical strength and
 catch us unprepared when we’re bone-tired.
 If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
 Then.... They’ll be coming soon.
 Humph, they’ve appeared.
 This is the perfect handicap. Believe it!
 Clone vs. Clone:Mine are Better than Yours!
 W-What is this?
 It’s quite a number.
 Moreover, they’re clones?
 Cornered rats.
 Shut up!
 Oh, they’re quite weak, huh?
 Good!
 Naruto!
 W-What are these guys?
 W-What’s going on here?
 I’ll assess this!
 Sharingan!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 W-What’s going on?
 My body’s…
 Are you okay?
 No mistake.
 It’s the real thing, not an illusion.
 – Scroll please.– Scroll please.
 That Kabuto was injured meansthese things are actual Shadow Clones?!
 B-But... even though Shadow clonesare supposed to vanish
 if they take a direct attack,these things don't vanish.
 Does it mean then this is Genjutsu?!
 Which is it?!
 Scroll please.
 Scroll please.
 Give me scroll.
 Dang it!
 It’s futile!
 Stop!
 These things are illusions.
 It’s an enemy Genjutsu.
 B-But, Kabuto’s wound is the real thing.
 No, it’s as Sasuke says.
 Probably the enemy is hiding somewhere…
 and coordinating their attack withmovements of the “Genjutsu Shinobis”
 and attacking from a different location.
 Pretending as if thoseGenjutsu Shinobis are attacking.
 – Scroll please.– Scroll please.
 Then I’ll find the idiot who’s behindthe scenes
 throwing Kunai knivesand kick his butt, believe it!
 Hold it, Naruto.
 We’ve been deceived asto the source of the Kunai knives…
 so we can’t discover the preciselocation of the enemy like this.
 Do you get it?
 That is the enemy’s purpose.
 From a data standpoint, it’s a typewho is weak at close combat
 and Taijutsu that likesthis kind of attack.95	02:22:38:03	02:22:42:29							The true enemy won’t come out		until we can’t move at all.
 Listen, everyone!
 In any case,
 all there is to do now is to fendoff the enemy attack.
 Fine, if that’s what their plan is…
 Now then…I wonder how far they can hold out.
 The night is long.
 Man! 					This is endless!
 Since it’s come to this…!
 Stop!
 Naruto, don’t waste your Chakra!
 Even if you attack these things,there’s no point!
 If I hit them all ina single sweep,
 the enemy won’t fire inadvertentlywhile these things are reverting back.
 The hiding place willbe discovered, so.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clones?!
 It’s not over yet!
 Sasuke, what should we do…?
 Man, that loser.All there is to do is go for it!
 B-But…
 Indeed…
 It’s not a situation thathe can get through by himself.
 Let’s go, Sakura!
 Y-Yeah!
 I’m not finished yet…
 Dawn is breaking.
 It’s finally time for the hunt.
 Mubi, that’s enough.
 We’re finished hunting their spirits.
 Now what’s left is just their bodies.
 Lucky.
 You’re…the one who…did my left shoulder.
 I finally found you.
 You really hung me up.
 Lucky.
 I can finally even the score.
 You…really hung me up.
 Lucky.
 I can finally even the score.
 Heh!
 Cornered rats.
 It went well, Naruto!
 W-What the heckare these guys?!
 T-This can’t be!
 Since when…?!
 Idiot!
 You finally showed yourtrue colors, punk!
 T-This brat, don’t tell me…
 The Shadow Clone is justthe preparation for the trick...
 for me to portray every memberof the team by myself!
 At the same time Narutolifted the Shadow Clone,
 the three of us hid.
 The Genjutsu users wereadversely deceived.
 Naruto!
 Naruto, you’ve used too much Chakra.
 I’ll do the rest.
 No way! I’m not always going to havethe good parts taken away!
 Is this really that Naruto…?
 Since when had he improvedthis much?
 That’s some brat…
 I can’t believe he can still move.
 Naruto…
 Amazing Chakra stamina…
 Right aftera Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu…
 a daring technique that transforms justthree of the bodies into his companions.
 To think he can still moveeven after doing all that.
 Here it’s the fifth day now.
 This kid will transform
 if he can just masterthe use of his Chakra.
 Not bad.
 But we’re still not unlucky.
 There’s no time.
 This time around,we’ll show you our Ninjutsu!
 Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow clones?
 No, they are plain clones.
 However, he's up to something.
 Be careful!
 Hah! If they are just clones,then there’s one real body.
 I’ll kick their butts rightand left until I run into him.
 You idiot.
 Such a tactless thing…
 I’m telling you!
 I’m saying don’t stick your nose in!
 Naruto!
 That’s reckless!
 Cripes!
 From earlier, the nape of my neckhurts when I use the Sharingan.
 Maybe I used too much Chakra.
 Dang it!
 Dang it. A clone?!
 This one, too?!
 This one, too?!
 This one, too?!
 Naruto! Stop!
 Are they all fakes?!
 Or could it be Genjutsu again?!
 This is… the last…Chakra.
 Sharingan!
 Sasuke!
 The bruise again…
 Stop using the Sharingan, Sasuke!
 It won’t do to create an opening!
 Kabuto!
 Darn it!
 Stop! Naruto!
 No matter how muchyou swing at them,
 the real body isn’t in those clones.
 Then where’s the enemyattacking us from?!
 If they are merely clones,the clones themselves can’t attack!
 If I knew that, we wouldn’t behaving a rough time of it!
 This is the enemy’s scheme.
 Man, I can’t usethe Shadow Clone Jutsu anymore…
 They’ve about reached their limit.
 Lucky.
 That’s it!
 The real body hides withthe Earth Style Jutsu
 and attacks from behind a clone!
 Kabuto!
 Heh, “it won’t do tocreate an opening,” right?!
 Thank you, Naruto.You saved me.
 We're okay here, Naruto!
 What happened there?  Are you hurt?
 That’s a terrible bruise.
 It’s nothing.
 Here it is, here it is!
 Look, the Heaven scroll!
 Good for you.
 There’s something about this guy...that I don’t like.
 Oh, it’s you guys.
 You’re late, Kabuto.
 I got a bit involved in something.
 Sorry.
 But, but…thanks to you, we got both the scrolls.
 No, it’s because you guys fought hard.
 You were amazingat the end, Naruto.
 We’re going through this door.
 Well then, I wish us both luck.
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 What of the harvest?
 Yes.
 More than I expected.
 I filled in his entire datafrom this second exam.
 You need this, right?
 So, how was it?
 Sure enough, it appears you’re curious.
 Master Orochimaru.
 I want to ask your opinion.
 As a Sound Village’s spy…
 That’s not necessary, is it?
 You will be the one to decide it all, so…
 I like that cleverness of yours.
 Good work.
 There’s nobody here.
 I’m okay now, Sakura.
 O-Okay.
 That’s too bad!
 Cha!
 Say-say, what’re we supposed to do?
 Oh! Look at that…
 Without… Heaven…I don’t get it at all.
 If “Heaven” does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge,and prepare for the chance.
 If “Earth” does not exist,
 run the fields in searchof an advantage.
 Open the series ofHeaven and Earth,
 and the perilous wayshall be redressed…
 This is namely the secret of“the one that guides…”
 What’s that?
 It looks like there are lettersor something missing there.
 It’s probably has to do with the scroll.
 I think this means we’re supposedto open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
 Okay then, I’m going to open it.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What’s this, what’s this?
 Here I thought that the reallystrong ones were remaining,
 but Hinata, Kiba, Shikamaru,all of the Leaf Village rookies are here.
 And that Lee’s team, too.
 So much for getting all inflated.

 show that I’m not in the same classas any ordinary blockhead!

 Sorry, I’ll calm down.

 I believe there is no one appropriatefor the job other than you.

 Guarding an important person…lt has such a nice ring to it!
 Listen seriously!
 Gotcha.
 Okay, about this mission…
 Shizune.
 Yes!
 The details are written inthose documents.
 His name’s Kunihisa,he lives in the capital.
 He’s the heir ofan old acquaintance of mine.
 Your acquaintance, Grandma Tsunade?
 Yes, his father’s name is Kunijiro.
 He made his fortune in one generation.He’s a successful jeweler.
 The heir of a jeweler…
 Hey, Papa?
 Is this real, too?
 Of course it’s real, little Kuni.
 So, is that and that and thisand the one over there too?!
 Of course, little Kuni!

 Suddenly my motivation is boosted!
 I’ll do it! I’ll do that mission!
 So where is this Kunihisa at,Grandma Tsunade?!
 Come in!
 – Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!– Wow! What’s this brat?
 Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
 Ninja?
 Don’t add that question mark atthe end of your sentence, don’t!
 So it must be you!
 You are the kid who’s going with Kunihisato play be a-Ninja-for-a-day…
 I’ll leave him to you, then.
 What? Be a Ninja for a day…?
 My little Kuni really admires Ninja,
 and he aggravates me by sayingnothing but Ninja everyday.
 Grandma Tsunade!
 Wasn’t thisthe guarding-important-person mission?!
 What are you talking about?
 I did say he’s an important person,
 but didn’t say a word aboutguarding him.
 I was fooled! Grandma!
 Naruto Uzumaki!
 I order you to play bea-Ninja-for-a-day with Kunihisa!
 Damn… That’s a dirty trick, Grandma!
 Oh, there’s one more thing.
 I added your regular missionsas a service.
 Oh, that’s cruel, Grandma Tsunade!
 Clean the pond, repair the bridge,get rid of the savage pig,
 and…
 It turns out that babysitting is just addedto the regular D-rank missions!
 Ninja, Ninja.
 Watch this, Kunihisa!
 I’ll teach you the awesomenessof a Ninja.
 Hey, awesome Naruto! Awesome!
 It’s “be-a-Ninja-for-a-day,” isn’t it?
 So Kunihisa, you gather garbagefrom over there, too.
 Okay!
 Oh, that’s right.Don’t go into the marsh.
 This marsh is bottomless,
 so once you’re caught,you can’t get out.
 Huh, what?
 – Oh, no, Young Master is in trouble!– Naruto!
 What are you doing?!
 You fool! I’ll save you,so you stay right there!
 Fool! I’ll be fine.

 Here!
 I’m telling you, stop that!

 Big Brother, it’s decided.

 Huh?!
 Hey, you ugly savage pig!
 Starting now,I, Kunihisa, will punish you!
 Go!
 Go! Get him! There!
 What, nobody wants to eat your meat!You dummy!
 He ordered all of this!
 What?!
 I didn’t want to,but he forced me to…
 Huh? W-Wait…
 That’s a lie. It’s a misunderstanding!
 Those are false charges!
 Forgive me! Naruto…
 I… How should I put this…?
 really hate guys like you!
 Why are you getting so testy?
 Geez, poor people just can’t helpthat they have short tempers…
 This’ll put you back in a good mood.
 Take as much as you want!
 Enough already!
 I’m telling you to stopdoing stuff like that!
 Why?
 It’s a big mistake to think thatanything can be resolved with money!
 There are times when you haveto use your own power!
 There hasn’t been anything thatI couldn’t do with money so far!
 You… Are you always like this?
 With that personality,you can’t make friends!
 It’s okay ‘causeI can buy friends with money!
 What…?
 You… Buy friends? You mean…
 If I give ‘em money,everybody will be my friend!
 Kunihisa…
 That’s why I hate country Ninjas.
 They’re cheap and stink of poverty…
 Stupid!
 Oh, please wait, Master Kunihisa!
 Running made me hungry.
 Take this and buy a boxed lunch!
 There’s nothing like a storeto buy lunch around here.
 Well, snacks will be fine!
 There’s no convenient storeor candy shop…
 You’re useless!This is why I hate the country!
 Stupid Naruto.
 What’s that?
 Oh, Young Master!
 Oh!
 Little fish, little fish!
 Let’s eat!
 The kid must be stupid to getcaught in this cheap trick.
 Don’t you agree, Bro?
 Yeah!
 Huh? Naruto?!
 Aw man,you’re really high maintenance.
 Those two guys just now…
 They were going to catch you!
 They were plotting a kidnapping, whatever…
 Whatever…?
 I’m often a target,because I have money.
 Often a target…? You…
 More importantly,I want to eat more fish!
 Go find a shop and buy some.
 You… Still think you can doanything with money?
 All right, watch this!
 Yay! Awesome! Awesome Naruto!
 How’s that?!
 You can just get things usingyour own power without using money.
 Even… without using money?
 Damn!
 He attacked us by surprise,that cowardly bastard.
 I’ll give it back to him doubled!
 Well, wait…
 If we do it thoughtlessly,we’ll just get creamed again.
 So what do we do?
 We’ll use that thing.
 That thing…?
 Look close at the movementof the fish…
 Aim for the instant whenthey fall after jumping up.
 Don’t get hasty.
 Now!
 Oh!
 That was close!
 O-One more time, Naruto!
 I’ll get the Kunai knife,so one more time!
 Master Kunihisa!
 – It’s deep over there!– Please be careful!
 I know, I know…
 Where did it go?
 I think it’s in this area, but…
 I won’t let you get away this time!
 You guys…
 We hired these guys withthe money you threw away.
 It means that now,they’re on our side…
 Hey, you guys! I’ll pay you doublewhat those guys did!
 So be on my side…
 Wh-What the…?
 Looks like you’ve run out of money.
 How about you guys over there?Wanna join us?
 We’ll pay up stacks of money.
 Humph! These guys have beenwith me for a long time.
 That paltry sum won’t…
 We’re not going along withyour selfish acts any longer!
 Y-You guys?!
 No! I don’t like it!
 Annoying brat. I’ll have to tie you upso you won’t move.
 What are you doing, Kunihisa?!
 Naruto, I… I…
 It’s fine already!
 Hey you… I’ll pay you double whatyou get for your mission.
 Won’t you hand that brat over to us?
 We’re just going to demandransom money from his parents is all.
 We won’t kill him.Relax and hand him over.
 I-It’s not enough?Here, how about this?
 Naruto…
 Kunihisa! Ride on my back!
 O-Okay.
 S-Still not enough, huh? Here!That’s all of it! Take it!
 Like I said…
 It’s a big mistake to thinkyou can obtain anything with money!
 Crap!
 After them!
 Listen! Hold on tightly Kunihisa.
 Okay!
 Damn! I can’t movewith him on my back!
 I can’t see the bottom, Naruto…
 Go!
 Okay! You go on ahead.
 What?! Go on ahead?!
 There he is! Let’s get him!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 Wh-What are you doing?!
 It’s okay! Hurry up and jump!
 I-I can’t… I’m scared, Naruto!
 It’s not scary, c’mon!
 I can’t… I’m scared…!
 Damn it!
 Do it!
 Naruto!
 Well, you’re coming with me!
 Hurry! Kunihisa!
 B-But……
 It’s okay… You can definitely do this!Believe it!
 Prepare yourself!
 No way!
 Go Kunihisa!
 Oh, Big Brother!
 Huh?! Kunihisa?!
 It hurts!
 I’m going to clean those guys outand then I’ll be right over!
 So wait a second!
 D-Daruto…
 D-Darudo!
 The wall’s collapsing… Escape!
 How long are you guys gonna beon top of me!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Wh-Wh-What’s going on?!
 I have to go to him!
 There are times when you haveto use your own power!
 Use my own…power!
 You can just get things usingyour own power with out using money.
 Even without money…
 with my own power!
 I can…do this!
 Just one step short!
 Naruto!
 Kunihisa!
 No! A little bit more!
 – We did it! 					– We did it!
 All right!
 I-It hurts but…I’m scared but…
 I…!
 You… What a face?!
 Kunihisa…
 You did a good job!
 Darudo!
 Wha--?!Hold on, don’t drip snot!
 But Naruto!
 Stop it!
 Well… See ya!
 Yeah! Next time you come playat my house, Naruto!
 Okay!
 Really… You took great care of him.Thank you!
 Yeah, well…
 Well then…
 Yes…
 Papa, Papa!
 What is it, little Kuni?
 Look, it’s sparkly and pretty…
 But it has no value,it’s just a marble, little Kuni.
 That’s true, Papa…
 But…
 As long as it's pretty, it doesn't matterwhether it's valueless, right?
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.

 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

164,"I want to try and gatherthe unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Too Late for Help
 You guys did good work.Komei has confessed.
 It seems he plottedthe Cursed Warrior…
 to mislead the public andto take the feudal lord position.
 Is that what Komei said?
 Yes. It turned out to besuch a trifle.
 The Cursed Warrior vanishing
 was a soldier disguising himselfas the Warrior
 using a strong nitrohydrochloric acidto melt his own flesh.
 It's empty again.
 With this, the Cursed Warriorincident is resolved.
 Now the Land of Birdsshould return
 to the beautiful andquiet land it used to be.
 Just a minute!
 But the Cursed Warrior still isn’t…!
 Don’t bother.
 But…!
 Now you are relievedof your duty.
 Have a safe journey backto your village…
 Why?!
 You said the one we saw first
 and the one last nightwere different, right?
 Perhaps there were multiple peopledisguised as the Cursed Warrior,
 not just one alone.
 If there was a personinside disguised,
 then how do you explainthe Warrior flying?!
 As long as our mission hasbeen ordered complete,
 there’s no reason to continuethe mission in this land now.
 Besides, Komei confessedto the crime, right?
 But, it’s suspicious!
 I can’t go along with itif I don’t get the whole story!
 This land hasits own circumstances.
 Getting too involvedwill cause trouble.
 Humph!
 Then I’ll just have to do itmy way.
 Hold it.
 I’m the leader of this team.
 So what?!
 You look into the movementsof the Cursed Warrior once more.
 Tenten and I will reinvestigatethis incident from a different angle.
 What? But the mission’s over…
 You have a pointwith what you said.
 Everything is moving alongtoo swimmingly.
 All right! Leave it to me.
 Huh?
 Where are you going, Naruto?
 Isn’t it obvious?To investigate the Cursed Warrior!
 What?
 Oh, Chishima.
 Um, Naruto just now…
 It’s nothing, it’s nothing.
 Did you have businesswith us?
 Oh, yes.
 You have all been so helpfulto me the whole time…
 I feel so bad aboutthat low payment…
 Additional money?
 We couldn’t…
 No, it’s the specialty ofthe Land of Birds,
 chicken wing buns filledwith bean jam.
 Yakitori Tsurucho
 Thanks!
 Sure enough,this area’s fishy, believe it.
 It’s kind of time-consumingsearching alone…
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Ahh, long time no see.Are you giving me a snack?
 Why is it you guys?!
 Dad’s busy with stuff, so.
 No, I can’t have Boss Gamaappearing, either…
 Well, I guess it can’t be helped.
 You guys have a better senseof smell than humans, right?
 You’re calling us puppies?!
 Geez! Toad authorityhas sure hit rock bottom!
 Gamatatsu, we’re leaving!
 Gamatatsu?
 Hey, Gamatatsu!
 A frog that pounces ona willow leaf?
 What’re you doing, you idiot?!
 Big Brother Gamakichi…
 I wonder what…this is?
 Whoa, it’s dark.lt’s night.
 Good night.
 Good morning.
 What’s this?
 It’s a kite painted black.
 A kite?
 Look up there!
 That’s a totally huge kite,believe it.
 I wonder if there wasa big kite-flying festival or something.
 It’s rather plain fora festival kite…
 What?! What does that mean?
 Oh no!
 Hey! Where are you going?!
 I’m back.
 I get it… If one were to fly thatin the cover of a dark night…
 A Cursed Warrior hangingonto the black kite
 would look like he was flying…
 With this, the mystery ofthe flying warrior is solved, believe it!
 Next…
 Someone was hereon that night…
 What is it?
 The Cursed Warrior came outfrom here.
 It just looks like an old templethat isn’t used much at all.
 You’re right.
 Let’s go, Gamatatsu!
 But Big Brother Gamakichi,it’s nice and cool here.
 What’re you talking about?!ln such a hot and humid temple…
 Indeed, that’s a nice damp wind.
 See? Isn’t it comfortable?
 Draft from down below here…?
 What’s this?
 Wow! I wonder ifa giant worm made this.
 Or a mole?
 All right, let’s check it out.
 I wonder how we should greeta mole if we were to meet one.
 Like I care!
 So Naruto is still investigatingthe Cursed Warrior, huh?
 I should probably inform Lord Moso.
 There was some trouble caused,
 but we have at last founda safe refuge.
 After him!
 Big Brother, where are we?
 Huh?! This place is…
 This is the residence ofthe feudal lord, isn’t it?
 Really? Residence ofthe feudal lord?
 No wonderit’s an impressive building.
 It was connected to this place?
 What was that sound?
 Oh! What a nice view.
 Hey! What're  you doing?!
 Shh! Keep quiet!We’ll be discovered.
 Big Brother Gamakichi!
 Uh, oh!
 You blockhead!
 Uh, umm…Good work with your duties!
 As for me,I’m not anyone suspicious!
 I was asked bythe Superintendent Moso and
 I’m investigating the incident…
 It’ll make sense ifI tell you about it!
 Oww!
 Lord Sagi! We have captureda suspicious man.
 What shall we do with him?
 What…? Oh!
 Oh. Sagi, bro! Hey!We met at the lake, didn’t we?
 Explain to them about me!
 I know no such person.
 What?!
 He’s not worth sendingto the magistrate’s office.
 Lock him in the dungeon.
 Yes, my lord!
 Hey, that’s harsh! Come on, Sagi!
 Hey! Wait a minute!Come on, hey!
 Come on.This is a misunderstanding!
 I was just going afterthe Cursed Warrior!
 Umm, everything will make senseif you just ask Mr. Moso.
 You okay?
 Yo!
 I can’t be fighting the soldiersof my employer’s land.
 Geez. You had to go andget caught in that trap!
 Well, it’s cool. I can get outof a place like this right away
 if I just use both my hands.
 Hey, untie this.
 Right. Just a second.
 Wha--?!
 Th-The Cursed Warrior…?!
 Damn it!
 If I could just use both hands,this guy would be…!
 Big Brother,are we going to let things be?
 If things go wrong,we’d be sliced in two.
 I wouldn’t want that.
 Just a little more…
 Just a little more…!
 Sagi?!
 What’s going on here?
 You’re the other Cursed Warrior?
 But, why?
 They say people become disembodiedspirits and avenge themselves…
 But that’s a lie!
 This watch has been handed downfrom generation to generation
 in the feudal lord family.
 It was supposed to be passedfrom father to son…
 But now along with that death,the watch has stopped ticking away.
 It must have been very sad…
 I am shamelessly living ononly for the sake of revenge!
 I can go to hell ifI can just complete my revenge!
 That’s no good!
 There is no way you could understand
 how someone who has had everythingtaken away from them feels!
 Like I know about stuff like that!
 But I, at least, know that living forthe sake of revenge is wrong!
 You’re a feudal lord, aren’t you?
 Is revenge the jobof a feudal lord?
 You know that’s not it.
 The true culprit Komeihas been arrested.
 You should just leavethe rest to Moso. Okay?
 It is no concern of yours…
 I must not let you live
 now that you havelearned everything!
 As the thief who snuck intothe residence of the feudal lord…
 your fate is a death sentence!
 No way…!
 This is creepy…
 This is the tomb of the successivegenerations of feudal lords, right?
 Yeah.
 That’s the tomb of the Lord Owashi…
 Byakugan!
 What’s this?
 What is it, Neji?What are you seeing?!
 There’s something poisonousin Owashi’s body.
 Was he assassinated…?!
 We’re surrounded.
 An announcement tothe Ninja from the Leaf Village.
 A message has justnow been delivered
 from the residence ofthe feudal lord!
 Your comrade has been arrestedfor infiltrating…
 the residence of the feudal lord…
 and his death sentencehas been determined!
 Leave the Land of Birds at once!
 If you don’t, you will be executed herefor the same crime.
 It doesn’t matter!Draw your bows!
 Neji, what should we do?
 Let’s go to the residenceof the feudal lord.
 We’re going to save Naruto!
 You’re…
 Kakashi Sensei!Naruto’s in trouble!
 We have to go to the residenceof the feudal lord immediately
 and save him…
 We can’t do that.
 Your mission is over.
 But!
 Don’t do anything otherthan the mission.
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Are we really going backto the village like this?
 I told you. Our mission inthe Land of Birds is finished now.
 But then, what’ll happento Naruto?
 We can’t interfere withthis land’s internal affairs.
 No way…
 Sorry. The responsibility restson me, the leader.
 Let it go… Sacrifice isa part of Shinobi missions.

 That darn Naruto…
 Zero Motivation:The Guy with Cloud Envy!
 – C’mon!– Hurry up with the match!
 Finish it up already!
 Stand up and start the match!
 Evidently, people don’t want tosee the minor players’ matches
 since they were really lookingforward to Sasuke’s match…
 If people aren't expecting anythingexciting from this battle,
 makes no sensefor me to have it.
 What? You’re giving up, too?
 My opponent’s a girl again?
 Hey, why aren’t you moving?!
 C'mon, get started!
 That kid has had zero fighting spiritfrom the beginning…
 C’mon! What is he doing?!
 C’mon Shikamaru!Get it together and do it!
 If you don’t come, I’ll go!
 Hey! Haven’t started yet…
 Man, that girl is so gung-ho.
 It doesn’t really matter ifI become a Chunin or not.
 But there's no reason whya man should lose to a woman.
 Well… let’s do it!
 This guy’s quick to run away…
 Nor any reason why a man shouldrough up a woman.
 But I don’t want to beroughed up either.
 He’s the kind of Ninja thatuses shadows.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 He’s probably trying to lure me intothe trees where there're lots of shadows…
 but I won’t let him.
 Why am I the only one who alwaysgets a woman for an opponent, cripes?!
 Shikamaru! You get her witha torrent of 16 combination…!
 Mind if I sit here?
 Huh?
 What…you?Your stomach okay?
 What? Wasn’t Sasuke’s match next?
 Shh!
 Everything’s fine, right, Sakura?After all, it's Sasuke, right?
 R-Right now, I should leave her alone.
 It looks like Shikamaru taking partin this final battle,
 it seems like he's in the wrong place.
 Don’t say that!
 I certainly don’t think thathe has any great techniques,
 but that Shikamaru isalways good at strategizing.
 That’s why I feel like we ended upin the preliminary round the other day.
 Hmm, yeah well…
 And after all, he jumped downinto the arena himself.
 He seems uncharacteristically driven.
 Even he can be passionateonce in a while!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 Geez, I envy a cloud being so free…
 I guess I pretty mucham completely without desire…
 Even the reason why I became a Ninja…
 was because I thoughtI would have a fun life, ya know…
 Get it together!
 C’mon Shikamaru!
 But…of course, it’s not that easy.
 What’s going on with that stupid face?!ls he underestimating me?
 Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!
 That’s right, with this attack,my armed attacks also were beaten down.
 I see…
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!I’ve seen that true identity!
 Evidently there’s a limit tothe stretching and shortening,
 changing shape of the shadow…
 No matter how much youchange the shape of the shadow,
 even when you stretch it,
 it can only span up tothe size of your own shadow.
 That’s right isn’t it?
 You got it…
 Even if I assume that he's made upthe distance,
 by stretching his shadow from the edgeof the shadow of the arena wall…
 This is the limit to how farthe shadow can stretch.
 This is the scope of his attack!
 15 meters, 32 centimeters!
 She took the distancewith the folding fan.
 Temari is stronger at long distancebattles than she is at close range…
 the outcome has already been decided.
 What? What is that sign…?
 That’s no sign. That’s like, his habit.
 Habit…?
 He enjoys passing time slowly.That guy’s like an old man.
 That’s why he likesJapanese checkers and chess
 and always makes me be his opponent.
 When he’s stuck on a move,he always does that.
 Why?
 He’s working out his strategy.
 And, I’ve never beaten him.
 A strategy…but this is an actual fight.
 It’s different from a game.
 But it's said that formation piecesthat were used to build battle strategy
 eventually becomegame pieces.
 Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.
 Wait a minute.
 When we grouped the Genin,I saw his scores.
 They were at about thesame level of that Naruto’s.
 He said that moving his pencil duringwritten exams at the academy is a pain,
 and during the tests,he always sleeps instead.
 A pain…?
 He was so good at strategy games,I felt something wasn’t right…
 so I had him take an IQ testunder the pretense that it was a game.
 And… how did it turn out?... …
 He was more than brilliant.
 With an IQ of over 200,he’s a super genius!
 T-Two hundred?!
 He’s done thinking…lt starts now.
 Looks like you’ve got somefighting spirit now…
 It’s pointless to hide!
 I wonder if he’s really got a strategy…
 M-Maybe…
 With that he has no approach!
 Shikamaru! Go for it!
 It’s pointless, isn’t it?
 He’ll give up soon.
 He hates thingsthat are a pain in the butt.
 You're wrong!At least, I hope so…
 But you may be right…
 How long are you going to run away!Cut it out!
 It’s no use.
 As long as I’m on theoutside of this line,
 he absolutely can’t catch me…
 No, wait! Close call!
 You caught on well.
 So you were dragging your feetto wait for the sun to set…
 in order to make the surfaceof your own shadow larger
 by stretching the shadow line of the wall.
 As the sun goes down,the shadows lengthen.
 Isn't that so?
 That was close! Shikamaru…
 But why is he using shadows?
 After all, Shikamaru is insidethe shadow of the field.
 If there’s even a little bit of light,he can make a shadow within a shadow!
 You don’t know a thingabout Shikamaru!
 A shadow…in a shadow…?
 Even if I calculate the heightof the sun now
 and the limit to the distanceof the previous attack,
 there's no mistaking the distance!
 Temari! Up!
 I see.
 What’s this?!
 Darn it!
 I won’t let you escape!
 I didn’t expect that he wouldcreate extra shadows to reach me
 by making a parachute with his jacket…!
 He’s impressive.
 Once I notice the parachute from above,I’ll take my attention off from my feet.
 That’s a sneaky trick to catch meoff my guard!
 However, now it’s clear.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu is
 one in which other shadows are usedto get your opponent,
 a skillful technique!
 She’s dodged this trick too…
 Not careful enough in the final stage.
 And his opponent is fairly analytical.
 She’s good at thinking ahead.
 If this battle takes too long,
 the shadows in the arena will grow,and his territory will increase.
 I’ll defeat him with the next one!
 Should I make a diversionwith Clone Jutsu…?
 Now his shadow is…
 Okay!
 Clone…
 N-No way…!
 My... body is…?!
 At last…Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!
 What?!
 What’s going on…?
 That boy…
 How much is he planning ahead…?
 That’s Shikamaru’s skill.
 Why…won’t my body move?!
 The shadow shouldn’thave reached this far.
 I'll let you take a look behind you…
 T-This hole…!
 You saw it too, didn’t you…?
 That hole is the hole Narutoburrowed and flew out of.
 So it’s connected to thebig hole in front of you.
 I didn’t expect that…a shadow in a tunnel of a hole…
 Right.
 Pure and simple,a calculated chess move.
 So his purpose to make Temari measurethe limit of the shadow several times
 was to lead her to his final trickof using this hole.
 Temari battled on the outsideof the limit of the shadow
 that she measured and followed,
 but he caught her from behind,trailed by the shadow she couldn’t see…
 There is no escape from this.
 I-It can’t be…
 The attack that he usedwith the jacket,
 was it a device to lead meto right this spot…?
 Was that an underplot too?!
 Why that--?!
 Checkmate with the next one.
 My body is moving on its own!I can’t resist it!
 Before anyone knew it,they fell under the spell of this match.
 That guy with no markis quite a darkhorse.
 Yes! You did it!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 Check…
 Good grief… I give up!
 What?!
 See I told you…he’d give up.
 Ino doesn’t know anythingabout Shikamaru.
 W-What did you say?!
 I’ve used too much Chakra from ShadowPossession Jutsu in rapid succession.
 I can’t hold it another 10 seconds.
 I thought of the next trick 200 times.
 But I’m out of time…
 This has become such a pain.
 Doing one match is good…
 That guy is a strange one.
 The winner is Temari!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling,so look up and smile too

 Wow, this is the largest cheerfrom the audience ever!
 Of course. The featured battleof this final tournament is about to begin.
 Hate to admit it,but I'm looking forward to it myself.
 Hey, Shikamaru.I can't hear what you said.
 There's not a single person who'snot excited about the featured battle.

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Such intensity...
 If I take a breath or move my eyesI will be marked and killed –
 that's what I'm feeling..
 If I'm stuck like this for an hour,I'll go mad.
 Facing a Jonin intent to kill…
 This sensation is like havingmy life held in limbo...
 No way! I'd rather dieto escape this feeling!

 Don't worry. I'll protectyou all with my life.
 I absolutely won't allowmy comrades to get killed.

 My Water Clone Jutsu wasbeing copied at that point…
 I absolutely won't allowmy comrades to get killed.
 By letting the clone talk as if it were you,you succeeded in distracting me.
 And you used Hidden Mist Jutsuto hide yourself to see what I was doing…
 But…
 I'm not a fool.
 That one was a fake too!
 Now!
 Makibishi spikes…!
 How foolish...!
 Sensei!
 Oh, I can't believe thatKakashi Sensei got …
 kicked away like that….
 His Taijutsu skills are alsoextremely good.
 W-What's with this water...?lt's awfully heavy.
 Humph... Fool!
 It's the Water Prison Jutsu!
 Darn it.
 My temporary escapeinto the water…
 was a huge mistake!
 You're caught…
 It's a special prison that makesit impossible for you to escape!
 It makes things harderhaving you able to act.
 Now…Kakashi.
 I'll have to settle thingswith you later.
 First, I will finish those guys off.
 Water Clone Jutsu…
 Didn't expect this level of skill…
 You're acting big,wearing a headband like a Ninja…
 But…a real Ninja is one
 who has hovered betweenlife and death numerous times.
 In other words,
 only those who are worth being listedin my Bingo Book
 deserve to be called Ninja.
 Guys like you can't becalled real Ninja.
 He's disappeared again!
 You're just a kid!
 Naruto!
 You three! Take Tazuna and run!
 You have no chanceagainst this guy!
 As long as he has me trappedin this Water Prison,
 he won't be ableto move from here.
 And he shouldn't be able to usethe Water Clone Jutsu
 if he's far enough awayfrom his real body.
 In any case, just run for now!
 Run away?
 You've got to be kidding me.
 That option was gonefrom the moment you got caught.
 Even if we ran,
 without you, sooner or laterwe'd be defeated by Zabuza…
 and we'd all be destroyed.
 Even if we were to reformthe Manji defense,
 it would be impossibleto block his attacks.
 In the end…
 we'll have...
 no options left.
 In order for us to survive,our only option is to rescue you.
 We'll just have to do it!
 There…!
 Too easy.
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke…
 T-This is the Jonin level…A real Ninja…
 We've got to run…At this rate…
 Seriously…! Seriously…!
 We'll be killed!!
 I'm going to swear onthe pain of my left hand!
 I'll never get into another situationfrom which I'll have to be rescued…
 I'll never be afraid orbe a coward.
 Are you hurt…scaredy cat?
 I won't lose to Sasuke.
 Can I borrow thatLeaf headband for a while?
 This?
 This is worn only by those who havegraduated from Ninja Academy.
 Naruto, come over here.I'd like to give you something.
 Congratulations on your graduation.
 That's because you'reall squirts
 who don't have the qualificationsto become Ninjas.
 Missions are all risky assignments.
 You pass!
 I'm not that little pranksterthat you think I am!
 I'm going to surpass the Hokage!
 And so I'm going to getthe entire Village
 to acknowledge my existence!
 That's right…
 I am a Ninja now. And...
 I decided that I was not goingto run anymore!
 That I wouldn't run away…!
 Y-You fool! Stop it!
 Oh, Naruto! What are you thinking?!
 Humph! Fool...
 What are you thinking…charging off on your own?!
 Even Sasuke is no match for him…
 No matter how hard we try,we Genin are no match for him…
 Huh...?!
 The headband….?!
 Hey! You, with no brows...
 Record in your Bingo Book…
 about the man who will one daybecome the Leaf Village's Hokage.
 Leaf-style Ninja…
 Naruto Uzumaki!!
 Naruto…
 When I first saw that little kid,he seemed so unreliable…
 Sasuke! Lend me your ear!
 What is it?
 I have a plan.
 You want to discuss plansunder these circumstances…?
 This guy...!
 Humph!You are talking of teamwork?
 W-What is this feeling…?
 Was Naruto so…?
 Now...
 Let's get wild…
 Now, let's get wild!
 Such loud snorting,but do you have a winning plan?
 T-This isn't good…
 What are you guys doing!I told you to run!
 It was obvious what was going to happenonce I was caught!
 Hurry! Run!
 Listen to me!Our mission is to protect Tazuna!
 Have you forgotten that?!
 Old man….
 Well...
 This is a seed that I planted…
 I can't say thatI want my life to be spared.
 Sorry, you guys…
 Fight as much as you want!
 You hear that?
 Are you ready?
 You guys really haven't learnedanything, have you?
 W-What?!
 You're still playing at being Ninja?
 When I was your age,
 this hand was alreadystained red with blood!
 Zabuza, the Demon!
 Ohh…? It seems thatyou've heard of me.
 A long time ago, in the Mist Village,often called the town of Blood Mist,
 Ninja candidates facedtheir biggest hurdle.
 So you also know aboutthat graduation exam…
 That graduation exam?
 What is it...?
 This graduation examthat you're talking about...
 The students killed each other.
 What….?
 Classmates who had shared ricefrom the same pot
 formed pairs and triedto kill each other.
 It didn't enduntil one of them died.
 Partners who used to talk abouteach other's dreams and aspirations…
 How cruel…
 Ten years ago,
 the Mist Village's graduation examwas forced to undergo drastic reform.
 That was because an evil demonhad appeared on the scene the previous year.
 Reform?
 What about the reform?
 What had that evil demon done?
 With no scruples or hesitation…
 a young boy who didn't even havethe qualifications for being a Ninja,
 annihilated over a hundred examinees.
 That sure was…fun…
 Sasuke!
 Die!
 Darn!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Ah... Shadow Clone Jutsu,and there are quite a few of them.
 Here I go!
 It's impossible, after all…
 There is no way thatyou can defeat the guy!
 There is only one way leftto defeat this guy!
 Sasuke!
 I see!
 So that's your plan, Naruto!
 That's pretty good for you!
 Demon Wind Shuriken,
 Windmill of Shadows…
 A Shuriken won't work on me.
 I see. This timeit's aiming for my real body…
 But...
 It's not so easy!
 A Shuriken inthe Shuriken's shadow...!
 This is...The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
 A second Shurikenin his blind spot!
 But...
 Still too naïve...
 He dodged it!!
 Here it is!
 Yes! The plan worked!!
 That Zabuza had no clueas to what I was thinking,
 and I fooled him!
 Ninja must be ableto see through the obvious.
 Did you see that – the Leaf-style fightingof Naruto Uzumaki?!
 Kakashi Sensei,the rest is up to you.
 Next episode: ""Kakashi, Sharingan Warrior!""
 I'm going to kick butt once again!

 The winner is Temari.
 Oh, I’m tired…
 Oh, what a waste!
 Why?! He had a chance tobecome a Chunin!
 Shikamaru is Shikamaru…
 Really… Does he or doesn't hehave the motivation?
 Even I’m not sure about it.
 But his intelligence and strategiesare no longer at the Genin level.
 If it had been an actual missionfor a basic platoon,
 the win was decided whenhe captured Temari…
 So, I suppose he won the competition,but he lost the match…
 It’s unfortunate he shows nosigns of being motivated,
 on the other hand, he won’t get tooemotional or fall into a panic.
 And that’s exactly why…
 he’d be able to calmly pull back ifhe viewed a situation as totally hopeless.
 That could be attributed tocalm judgment.
 Shikamaru probably possesses…
 the most important psychologicalelement required for a Chunin…
 the disposition of a leader!
 In order to evaluate someoneas a leader of a platoon…
 it’s much more important toprotect the platoon from danger,
 than to carry out a mission.
 Yeah…it’d hardly be worth mentioninga completed mission
 if everyone was annihilated.
 The risks and the missionshould be put on a scale,
 surviving should be thought of first,and then action should be taken.
 A person who can’t do this isn’tqualified to become a Chunin.
 Hyuga and Naruto from earlierfail on that point.
 Although they are all rightas insignificant Genin.
 Well, I do feel like Shikamarugave up too soon too.
 What do you think?
 What do I feel…?
 He has more of a chancethan Naruto, for sure!
 Shoot…!
 Why the heck did he give up!
 Is he an idiot?!
 This ticks me off!
 I’m gonna really give hima lecture!
 So the one that’s gonnabecome a Chunin is…
 You idiot!
 Shut up, super idiot!
 Why the heck did you give up?!
 Let’s not talk about that anymore,all right?
 It’s not all right! It was a matchyou were close to winning!
 – Let's just watch the next match.– But you just gave up! Unimaginable!
 Simply unimaginable!
 Huh? The next match?
 Sasuke…!
 ""Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand""
 At last, Uchiha’s match is next.
 Oh, but who’s this opponent Gaara?
 I wonder…
 But compared to Uchiha,he’s nothing much.
 Do you know?
 I hear Uchiha’s gonnawithdraw from this match.
 Really?!
 Yeah, he apparently sustained a seriousinjury while training before the match…
 Are you serious?
 And to think I took time offspecifically to see this match!
 I’m counting on you, come on!
 As you’d expect, this matchwill be won by Uchiha.
 No way, I’ve got high hopefor the new one of the Sand.
 He won’t let this one slip by.
 As they say about the worldof competition…
 It’s impossible to predictwhat will occur…
 Lord Hokage, about Uchiha Sasuke,
 he has not yet arrived at the arena.
 Umm…it’s unavoidable…
 We can’t make the guestswait any longer.
 Another ten minutes.
 Why don’t we wait justanother ten minutes?
 But…
 The guests are looking forwardto the next match above all else.
 Cancelling it would be cruel.
 Since it’s come to this,waiting another ten minutes wouldn’t hurt.
 Lord Hokage…?
 Umm…
 Uchiha, where are you!
 What's keeping you?Hurry up!
 There is some truth to whatKazekage says.
 So shall we extend it forten minutes from now.
 So…let Genma know of this.
 Yes!
 If it stays like this, Uchiha will reallybe forced to withdraw.
 I see…a ten-minute extension…
 Sasuke…
 Hey, isn’t that…
 Y-You are…
 But, what’s that idiot doing!He’s still not here?!
 Sasuke…!
 Please!
 Good of the two of you to make it!
 Come now, hurry into the arena!
 Yeah!
 All right! Here we go!
 Oh! Yeah!
 Most of the first round is finished,
 and the only one left isSasuke Uchiha and Gaara.
 H-How about Naruto andNeji’s match…?!
 Well, the interesting thing is…
 That Hyuga lost…
 Naruto beat Neji…
 I see…
 You did it!
 Naruto!
 You’re such a…good guy really…
 – What’s going on with the next match!– Let's get on with it!
 Isn’t Uchiha up yet?!
 We want Uchiha! Uchiha!
 Uchiha!
 Hey, it’s almost time.
 Is he really gonna come?!
 He’ll come…
 He’ll definitely come!
 Oh Sasuke, what’s he doing!
 What the heck is Uchiha doing?!
 It seems the rumor thathe’d had a serious injury was true.
 If there’s a win by default,then this match is mine.
 Thirty more seconds…
 Uchiha!
 Uchiha!
 Sasuke…please come!
 Sasuke!
 Hurry up and come!
 It won’t be good if it stays this way!
 The time limit is up.
 So this is it.
 Because the time limit has expired,the last match…
 See… Here he is…
 Well, I’m sorry we’re late…
 Sasu…
 Your name?
 Sasuke…Uchiha.
 Sasuke…Uchiha.
 Sasuke!
 It looks like he made it in time.
 Lee!
 Darn… Causing othersthis much trouble…
 and thinking himself so important!
 Huh! You’re pretty late!
 I thought you weren’t coming‘cause you were scared to take me on!
 Who the heck was it thatsaid he’d come for sure?
 The first round…did you win?
 Of course!
 Don’t get too carried away…
 Loser!
 Well, I know it’s somewhat rudeto be showing up all flashy like this…
 but was Sasuke…
 disqualified?
 So your habit of tardinessrubbed off on him? Cripes…
 And…what about it?
 It’s all right, Sasuke’s matchhas been postponed anyway.
 Your arrival was barely in time, but…
 he hasn’t been disqualified.
 That’s good to hear!
 Don’t lose to a guy like that!
 Yeah…
 I want to fight you too…
 Sasuke!
 I want…to fight you too!
 Yeah…
 Yay, Sasuke!
 Uchiha's match is gonna start!
 Shikamaru gave it so much,but already it’s Sasuke…
 Poor Shikamaru…
 Hey, is that Uchiha?
 I‘m just second fiddle…
 Well, I guess that’s justthe way it goes…
 I’m looking forward to it too.
 Your team is sort of amazing, Sakura.
 What is?
 Well, Naruto did beat thatNeji Hyuga and…
 Sasuke is an elite memberof the Uchiha…
 and it seems like everyone’sanxious to see Sasuke’s match.
 Sasuke will face that Gaaraof the Sand whom I couldn’t beat…
 And Naruto beat that Nejithat I had hoped to take down.
 Why is it so…
 Why am I so…
 frustrated!
 Lee…!
 At last…
 Gaara, come down here!
 Naruto! Let’s go up!
 Yeah!
 When we go up,we’ll leisurely take the stairs.
 What’s up with you!
 Are you still upset thatI pushed you down?!
 T-This isn’t good…
 It’s been quite awhilesince I’ve seen Gaara like this.
 H-Hey…Gaara.
 Keep the strategy in mind--!
 Don’t talk to Gaara right now!
 You’ll be killed.
 Right!
 Let’s go!
 Hey, hurry up!
 Nothing good’s gonna happenin your life if you panic.
 What’s wrong?
 Huh?
 Low-level tournaments like thisChunin Examination are ideal
 as gambling matches.
 A number of feudal lordsare here for that purpose.
 So…would you lose this match for us.
 Hey, come on,at least give us an answer.
 Too scared to say anything…
 H-Help!
 S-Stop! Stop!
 If those two in front of ushadn’t been there,
 we probably would’ve been killed…
 This is the first I’ve seen anyonekill people without hesitation like that…
 This isn’t looking goodeven for Sasuke.
 Sasuke…
 So now…at last…
 Everyone makes mistakeslt's nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
 So many regretsDon’t let this scar be for naught

 Darn it!What kind of guy is that?!
 Gaara is totally not normal!He doesn't even look at us.
 If anyone fights with him like that…
 Darn! Hey Shikamaru!We've got to go see Kakashi Sensei!
 We've got to stop this fight,no matter what!

 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Hmm, what?
 A wanted flyer.
 ""This man who calls himselfTokichi is a major criminal
 who has killed a family of three…""
 ""He has a bird-shaped birthmarkon his chest.""
 A bird-shaped birthmark…?lt couldn’t be…
 What is it, Hinata?
 I can’t tell becausehis face is covered with scars.
 But he has…a bird-shaped birthmark.
 He has a bounty on his head too?
 What the heck is going onwith everything?
 Hunt or Be Hunted?!                     Showdown at the OK Temple
 Where are you going, old man?
 Just rest quietly.
 Let go!
 Stay out of my way! Gosunkugi is mine…
 What the heck can you do in that condition,you wanted man?!
 A bounty hunter who wasin the bar attacked last night…
 What’s the idea of a bountychasing after a bounty?
 It’s none of your concern!
 Your wound again…
 Stop!
 D-Don’t move!
 I didn’t do it…
 Then, how do you explainthis wanted flyer?
 That Gosunkugi did it…
 He killed an innocent familyof three…
 just to steal money.
 What do you mean by that?
 I was a swordsmith in a tiny village…
 in a small country sandwichedbetween two large countries.
 I was poor,but for me it was a happy life.
 But on that festival day…
 I was about to go deliver a swordthat a customer had ordered.
 I wanted to participate in the festivalright away, so I was hurrying.
 At that very moment…
 For some reason,the door was half open.
 It’s Tokichi…I’m delivering the sword you ordered…
 I told everyone everythingas it happened.
 But…the people in the villagewouldn’t believe me.
 It’s because I was the only onewho hadn’t shown up at the festival.
 And the particular shape of the swordthat stabbed through the family…
 A swordsmith should be ableto make any kind of weapon…
 That was the reason.
 Stand up, Tokichi!
 Tokichi!
 Don’t let him get away! After him!
 And ever since…
 I wandered aimlessly from town to town.
 BOUNTY One million ryo
 It was somethingthe villagers had issued.
 And there was one morewanted flyer besides mine…
 BOUNTY 					Threee million yen
 …of the man who killed the family.
 I resolved to capture Gosunkugiwith my own hands.
 I would clear my name andreturn to my village…
 And…to get some information about him,if even just a little…
 I became a bounty hunter despitehaving a price on my own head.
 So that’s why we were in the way, huh?
 The only way to prove my innocenceis for me to capture him myself.
 I want to go home.
 Will you…concede him to me?
 We’re Ninja.
 We carry out missions we’ve received,no matter what!
 Even if the worst were to happen,we can’t let him get away.
 Let’s go…
 Was that okay, Naruto?
 That Gosunkugi jerk!
 We have to capture him,no matter what.
 That’s right.
 And if that old man, Sazanami,pushes it too far in his condition,
 not only will he fail in capturing Gosunkugi,he could end up getting killed instead.
 Don’t hold back.I’ll give you…
 the likes of my head.
 You’re wounded,so I can kill you whenever I want.
 Before that, I’ll be taking Gosunkugi.
 Well, I guess I’ll just havethose Shinobi kids do their best.
 The Land of Stone,Post Station Two…
 It seems everything in this town…
 politics, economics, military,is conducted by monks.
 It really is. Nothing but temples…
 The temple, which could becalled the head temple,
 is the OK Temple on that mountain.
 Hey, Hinata. What’s that bell?
 That was created asthe sightseeing crown jewel
 to recruit people to live in their temple…The Golden Bell!
 It’s just like it is saying,“Please steal me.”
 I know…Gosunkugi is after that bell!
 – Yeah. 					– Yeah.
 But how does that Gosunkugi guyintend to steal that bell?
 Naruto!
 Huh…?
 You guys…are Gosunkugi’s…!
 Are these guys going to corral us?!
 Just like the time with Sazanami…
 Byakugan.
 Look out! Run!
 Old Man Sazanami?!
 Leave this to me!
 All right!
 Eat this!
 What’re you doing here…?
 I just came to settle the score.
 But…your wound is still…
 I won’t get in your way.
 I’ll pursue the target on my own.This is a competition!
 I guess it can’t be helped.I accept!
 But we can’t even startas things stand now!
 There are still nails in the ground…
 He’s waiting for the best moment.
 Gosunkugi!
 The bell…is at the top!
 What…?! Could it be…?!
 Oh, no…!
 The nails in the ground aren’t moving.
 The Jutsu has worn off!
 What?!
 Damn it! When did he--?!
 So as the words say,we’ve been “nailed down,” huh?
 They're by the bell!
 Why that--!
 Wait! Don’t forget the bounty hunterfrom last night is also after Gosunkugi!
 No problem…! We’ll get there first,no matter what!
 Let’s go!
 How awful…
 That Gosunkugi jerk…!
 Unforgivable!

 What?!
 Bounty Sazanami,otherwise known as Tokichi…
 I, Gatsu, have apprehended you!
 And you, bounty Gosunkugi!
 Your spree of evil deeds…
 The number of chargesagainst you is incalculable…
 A government official has orderedyou hauled in for questioning!
 Old man…
 Damn it. There’s nothing we can doif the opposition is a bureaucrat…
 You murderer!
 Give back the family you killed!
 We’ll kill you in the same way!
 Damn it…!
 Hey, hey, you guys!
 You’ve got nerve to put up wanted flyerswithout doing a decent investigation!
 This man is the true culprit behindthe murder that occurred in this village!
 This Gosunkugi has already beenapprehended and has confessed.
 And the weapon has been seized…
 Therefore this individual Tokichishall be acquitted!
 You jerks!You made me work for free!
 What’re you going to do about it?!
 Why’d you do that for me?
 I overheard some stupid taleof woe, you see.
 It makes no differenceto a bounty hunter…
 But I overheard it,and so I had no choice.
 It was necessary to verify whetheror not you really are a wanted man…
 You…
 Not “you.” Gatsu!
 I’m also a bounty hunter…I’m in the same trade as you!
 Gatsu…
 Tokichi… We’re sorry.
 Forgive us, Tokichi.
 Good for you… Old Man Sazanami.
 Let’s go.
 I’ve kind of gotten homesick andreally miss the Leaf Village…
 But you know, a failed missionmeans failure…
 The Fifth Hokage’s goingto scold you good, Naruto.
 What?!
 You failed another mission?!
 I…don’t want to go home…
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you

 W-What the heck is going on here?
 Hmm…
 Help me!
 Excuse me there, Mister!Wait just a moment!
 What in the world is happening?
 You should run away too!
 There’s a monster up there!
 A monster…?
 What could it be?This monster thing?!
 It’s a g-gigantic snake!lt destroyed the castle in a flash!
 How big of a snake?!
 Me too, at my village before…
 I was attacked by a huge snake!
 We must hurry, Naruto!
 That snake is probably the same onethat you saw before.
 Destroy the Leaf Village…?!
 And your answer is?
 Lady Tsunade!
 No! You must not believein their sweet talk…
 Your brother and my unclewouldn’t want any of that!
 Their wishes…
 Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…
 And dreams…Did you forget them ?!
 I know it!
 Even if you are like this now,you still…
 Open your eyes! Wake up, please!
 Shut up, Shizune!
 You don’t have to answer right now.
 However, I want it in a week.
 Also, two human sacrifices are neededfor this Forbidden Jutsu,
 so do what you need to doto prepare them.
 Lady Tsunade, let’s kill them right here!lt’s our chance!
 With you and me, now we can…!
 Lady Tsunade…
 Sure, I am weak now.
 However…
 I also know Tsunade’s weakness.
 That’s right, he is one of the Sanninlike Tsunade.
 So he knows that…
 I see it’s not cured yet…
 your fear of blood.
 Hemophobia…?
 Shall we get going, Kabuto?
 Tsunade… I’ll be expectinga favorable answer from you.
 Looks like we were a little too late…
 Is this that snake’s doing, too?!
 – Let’s go, Naruto! 					– Huh?
 Tsunade isn’t here any more.
 Geez, you keep telling me that…!
 Welcome!
 Hey, you ol’ man, give me another shot!
 Lady Tsunade, you’re drinking too much!
 Lady Tsunade…
 Heck, she’s nowhere to be found!
 Dragging me around here and there,
 but after all,we haven’t found a single trace!
 Hmm?
 Well, let’s dine here for now.
 Huh?
 Isn’t this a pub?
 So what?
 I've told you so many times!I’m still underage!
 You fool. Nobody is asking you to drink.Kids should only be eating snacks.
 – Well then… 					– Welcome!
 There’s no need to dine here!
 We can go to a ramen noodle shopor something!
 How stupid! You can gather informationin this type of place…
 Huh…?
 Huh?!
 Tsunade!
 Jiraiya?!
 Why…are you here?
 I’ve finally found you!I’m exhausted…
 That gal is Tsunade?!
 She’s 50 years old for real?
 Now, that’s a swindle.
 I can’t believe…I met two of the Sannin in one day.
 Here you are!
 In any case…Today is a day I see many old friends.
 You mean Orochimaru…
 What happened?
 Nothing, really.We exchanged a greeting.
 Is it really true that this galis the Kunoichi
 who can heal any kind of wound?
 What about you?
 What do you want from me?
 I’ll be straight with you.
 Tsunade, the village has demandedthat you become the Fifth Hokage.
 Hey, ol’ man,gimme the simmered meat with potatoes!
 All right, in a moment.
 The Fifth Hokage?!What’s this out of the blue?!
 What the heck is going on?!
 Do you know about the Third Hokage?
 The Third Hokage?So, he really was…
 Orochimaru did it, right?
 I heard about it.directly from him.
 Orochimaru did it…?
 Orochimaru?!
 Did he really killed the old man,the Third Hokage?!
 Who is this Orochimaru?!
 Just like us, he’s one of the Sannin.
 Why?! The Sannin are allfrom Leaf Village, right?
 Then why--?!
 Who’s this brat?
 He’s Naruto Uzumaki.
 This brat is…that Nine-Tailed Fox…?
 Hey, you just hold it there!
 I am not done talking yet!
 This Orochimaru?!This bastard that killed Old Man Hokage.
 Who the heck is he?!
 He’s a legendary Sannin, right?!
 Then knowing that…
 why would you, Pervy Sage,leave such a guy alone?!
 Besides…
 What do you mean this personis the Fifth Hokage?!
 Naruto, be quiet for a moment.
 But…!
 Just shut up!
 I’ll say this again.
 They are demanding thatyou become the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade.
 So what’s your answer?
 Will you accept it?
 I’ll resurrect the little brotherand man, both of whom you loved…
 This time, I will completely destroy Leaf!
 What do you say…Tsunade?
 Lady Tsunade…
 I really don’t get it!
 Impossible…
 I refuse!
 I remember…those words.
 You said those same wordswhen I asked you to go out with me.
 What the heck are you talking about?!You said it yourself!
 Didn’t you say thatyou will bring her back to the village
 and have her treat Sasukeand Kakashi Sensei ?!
 But what’s this demandfor her to be the Hokage?!
 And, on top of that, she refuses!
 Lady Tsunade…
 Could she be thinking of makinga deal with Orochimaru?
 Calm down.
 There can’t be no other Fifth Hokage,but this Tsunade.
 During the dreadful Great War Era,
 she contributed tremendouslyto the Leaf’s victory.
 To this date,
 there’s no one who can rivalher combat and medical skills.
 Still more, this Tsunade isthe granddaughter of the First Hokage.
 So together with her talents,
 there’s no one else more suitedto becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 If she becomes Hokage,
 that means thatshe’ll come back to the village.
 And then, as I’d told you,she can treat the two.
 Besides, this is what the Leaf’stop decision-making advisors settled upon.
 Genin like you have no sayon this matter.
 Jiraiya…
 Unlike your previous apprentice,
 this kid not only has a bad mouth and wit,he’s ugly to match.
 What?!
 It’s tough on anyone to becompared to the Fourth Hokage.
 He had all the qualities to bethe greatest Ninja in all history.
 Brimming with talent in Jutsu,and he had a brilliant mind!
 Popular with people and well…he was as handsome as me.
 But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly.
 Risking his own life for the village…
 Life is different from money…
 To easily risk it and lose it,is a fool’s doing!
 Did she say “fool”?!
 Both my grandfather and the Second Hokage
 seemed to want to subduethe disturbances of war above all else.
 But after all, they died in vain,
 in the midst of their dreamsfor the village.
 You have changed, Tsunade…
 I don’t know whatyou thought in your heart before,
 but to say such thing out loud…
 Although I look young,I’m already in my 50s…
 Years change people.
 Same goes for Sarutobi Sensei…
 No wonder he died showing offat that old age!
 Hokage is a bother.
 No one but a fool would take it on.
 Why you--?!
 – Let go of me!– Don't! We're in a pub.
 I said, let go of me!
 Lady Tsunade…!
 Anyone who makes fun of the old manand the Fourth Hokage…
 It doesn’t matter ifyou are a woman!
 I’ll clobber you with all my might!
 You’re pretty gutsy…confronting me like this.
 Let’s take this outside, brat!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Though I may not look it,I am one of the Sannin.
 Why should I even take a Genin seriously.
 What did you say?!
 An advance notice for a KO?
 I don’t mean one minute…
 With one finger.This is enough to take you down.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Well…
 Come on, kiddo.
 D-Don’t make fun of me!
 Darn it!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Forehead poking?!
 Why that no good--!
 She’s strong…
 Hey, brat!
 I’ll ask you one thing before you faint.
 Why…get so passionate atthe mention of Hokage’s name?
 Unlike you…
 I will be the heir to the Hokage name,no matter what!
 Because Hokage is…
 Because Hokage is my dream!
 That kid…
 What? She’s a bit off her guard…
 I can’t tackle her head on.
 Then, I should use that Jutsu now…
 Concentrate!
 Oh, no!
 Wha--?! This Jutsu is…!
 Take this!
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 It's been a long time since we drankalone like this, isn't it, Tsunade?
 I didn't necessarily want to see you.
 Don't say that.
 By the way,you're prettier than before.
 You haven't changed a bit.
 Understand this.I'm not interested in you.
 Neither am I.After all, you're actually 50 years old--
 – Did you say something?– No, nothing.
 I was just rememberingthe old days.

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days

 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 Withdraw! You’re not suitedto being a Shinobi.
 You don’t have the privilege ofdeciding what a person is like, stupid!
 Hinata, give it to him!
 Naruto…
 Don’t just take it! Argue back!
 I’m getting irritated watching this!
 Naruto...
 Thank you!
 The expression of her eyeshas changed...
 So you're not going to withdraw?
 I’m not taking responsibilityfor what happens…
 I don’t want to run away!
 Byakugan!
 Brother Neji! I challenge you!
 Here!
 A Failure Stands Tall!
 As I thought, this is the extent of it…
 the head family’s power!
 What the--?!
 But Hinata laid a perfect strike!
 N-Not yet…
 What's with this guy…!
 I-It can't be….
 Well, now….
 I guess this is why he's calledthe most gifted of the Hyuga clan yet.
 Y-You mean… All this time…?
 That's right! I can seethe Chakra Points.
 W-What is he talking about?!
 On the Chakra Network…
 there are 361 energy centersor Chakra opening,
 each about the sizeof the head of a pin.
 They're called Chakra Points.
 Theoretically, hitting one directlycan halt or increase Chakra flow,
 enabling one to gain complete control overan opponent's flow of Chakra.
 Just so you know,
 not even my Sharingancan see Chakra Points!
 Having the penetrating eyeis one thing,
 but to hit it so accurately likethat during a match,
 well, that's just…
 Lady Hinata...
 What we have here is an unchangeabledifference in abilities.
 It's what distinguishesthe elite from the failure.
 It is brute, unalterable fact.
 You were destined to regret having said
 that you don't want to run anymore, the instant you said it.
 And now, you must haveabandoned yourself to despair!
 This is your ultimatum…
 Withdraw!
 I-I...
 I-I meant it...
 and am…sticking by…
 every word...
 Hinata…
 I said!
 I'm not gonna run away!
 Because that's…my Way of Ninja!
 I had no idea... Hinata was this tough…
 She's a lot like you.
 Come to think of it…She's always watching you.
 Huh?
 Hinata…
 Bring it on!
 She has reached her limit.
 One more blow and…
 Neji's hits to Hinata's Chakra Points
 have completely haltedher flow of Chakra.
 That means she can no longersend Chakra
 into her opponent's bodyto fight in the Gentle Fist.
 This match is as good as over.
 But I never imagined there wouldbe someone this powerful…
 I'm afraid even our Sasukeis no match for him.
 It looks as if Neji may very welltake this Exam.
 It's going to take more than whatthis girl has to bring him down.
 L-Look at those eyes…
 Is he going to try to kill her?No, no, that's absurd.
 Doesn't it seem that…
 Neji’s strength is somehowagainst the rules?
 He's just too powerful…
 I mean it!
 Go, Hinata!
 Naruto...
 Strength has come backinto her eyes…
 I've been watching you…
 I've been watching you closelyfor many years now!
 Why I wonder…?
 Next up is Naruto Uzumaki!
 What a pain!
 It's all your fault!
 Like I care!
 Okay!
 Naruto… d-do your best.
 Transformation!
 I don't know why, but…
 I am Naruto Uzumaki!
 I'm not about to lose tothe likes of any of you!
 Is that perfectly clear?!
 I'm not about to lose tothe likes of any of you? Yeah, right!
 That idiot.
 He made a roomful of enemiesin the space of an instant.
 When I watch Naruto...
 Naruto, stand up!
 If you compete with mefor the name of Hokage…
 You… will be the loser!
 I can feel courage welling up.
 I feel that I can hang on,that I can do it…
 that I too am worth something!
 Oh!
 – No! 					– Hinata!
 Hinata...
 At some point, Hinata, who wasin the habit of just giving up,
 made up her mind to change.
 Hey, Hinata. It's time to go home.
 She put every ounce ofher being into her training.
 I saw it with my own eyes.
 But even so, she continuedto fail all her missions.
 She lost her nerve whenfaced with real competition
 and became easily discouraged.
 But today's Hinata is different.
 I have never…
 seen…that look in her eyes before.
 Naruto.
 I have always donethe watching up to now,
 but, now, finally…
 finally, I am…
 Naruto!
 You just don't get it, do you?
 Your strikes were ineffectivefrom the very first.
 It's the end.
 Hinata… That's enough.
 You lost the match,
 but you've become a new personin the process.
 You did well.
 I want to change that about myself…
 So I proposed it myself…
 Neji's final blow wentstraight for the heart.
 I feel sorry for her,
 but she won't be standingagain now.
 As further fighting is not feasibleunder these conditions…
 Don't stop it!
 Don't stop the match!Believe it!
 Naruto, stop!
 What on earth are you saying, stupid!
 She's had it. You can seeshe's unconscious…
 Huh?
 Why do you stand up?
 If you continue like this,you’ll really die!
 He is now finally forthe first time truly seeing me.
 I will not be caught looking bad...
 Why?!
 in front of...
 the person I admire most.
 I-I am far from finished!
 Give up the bravado…
 I can tell you're justbarely standing.
 You've shouldered the lotof having been born
 to the head family line of the Hyuga…
 And cursed and blamedyourself for being weak...
 But, people cannot change.
 That's just the way it is.
 There is no need for youto suffer any more!
 Surrender to it!
 You're wrong... Brother Neji.
 Because I can tell…
 that you are sufferingmuch more than I.
 What?!
 You are the one who is torn up
 over the fate of headand branch family.
 Neji, the match has been called!
 Oh boy!
 Neji, get a hold of yourself!
 You promised me
 you wouldn't let the head familything get you riled up!
 Why are all the other Joninbutting in?!
 The head family getsspecial treatment, eh?
 Hinata?!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Hinata! Are you okay?!
 Hey!
 Naruto…
 Yeah.
 I…
 Do you think…
 I…changed maybe a little bit?
 Hey you, failure!
 I have two piecesof advice for you.
 First, if you intend tocall yourself a Shinobi,
 stop that revolting cheering of yours.
 And the second...
 a failure will always be a failure.
 There's no changing that!
 Do you want to see about that?
 You!
 Naruto, I get where you'recoming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must bedone officially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted geniusthrough sheer effort…
 Wouldn't that make foran exciting main battle?
 Though, I am probably goingto be the one fighting Neji…
 but it would be okay with meif you ended up fighting him, Naruto.
 All right already.
 So this is okay then,right, Guy Sensei?
 Lee! You….
 Nice going!
 Oh, no! She's gone into ventricle fib.
 Was he trying to kill her then?!
 The precious little time you havewould be better spent
 seeing to her than glaring at me.
 Medics!
 Hurry! What's taking so long?!
 S-Sorry.
 Get her on the stretcher.One, two, three.
 It's serious. She 's got about10 minutes at the most!
 Get her to the emergency room.Pronto!
 Out of the way!
 Hinata…
 Because that's my Way of Ninja.
 I promise you.
 I will win no matter what!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy

 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark

 This should do it!
 Why?!

 No.

 True, the seal is almost off
 and the Chakra of the Nine-TailedFox Spirit is escaping, but…
 Fortunately, the seal is notcompletely broken!

 Do you hear me, Zabuza?
 We're both busy people.
 I know it's against your style,
 but I think it's about timewe stopped playing around.
 Why don't we settle this onceand for all with the next move?
 Interesting.
 What can you possiblydo in this situation?
 Kakashi, go ahead. 					Show me.
 No good…

 I can't defeat this boy.

 Why?
 Why stop?

 You can't defeat me withthat kind of strength.
 Wasn't he someonespecial to you?
 Is there someone specialin your life?
 I want to protect someonespecial to me.
 I want to make thatperson's dream a reality…
 That's my dream.
 Many people misunderstand.
 They pity and don't finish offthe enemy they ought to finish.
 They let them survive.
 To me, that isn't compassionor anything.
 Do you know?
 How it feels tonot be needed by anyone?
 To live day to day without a dream.The pain of it all.
 What are you saying?
 Zabuza has no usefor a weak Shinobi.
 You took awaymy reason for existence.
 Why?
 Why do you have toserve a guy like that?
 He gets the money from thugsto do bad things!
 Is that No-Browthe only person special to you?
 A long time ago,I had other people special to me.
 They were…my parents.
 I was born in the Land of Water,in a small village heavy with snow.
 My parents worked on a small farm.
 We were very poor,
 but my parents seem tobe satisfied with it.
 I was happy then…
 They were loving parents.
 But…
 When I was old enoughto understand things,
 something happened.
 Something?
 What happened?
 My blood…
 Blood?
 Go on!
 Tell me what happened.
 My father…He killed my mother.
 Then he tried to kill me.
 Huh?!
 After the experience ofthe ceaseless civil war,
 people with Kekkei Genkai werehated and feared in the Land of Water.
 Kekkei Genkai?
 It's special powers or Jutsupassed on through certain clans,
 from parent to child,or from grandparent to grandchild.
 Because of their special powers,
 those of the clans were exploited inall sorts of battles.
 As a result, all Kekkei Genkaiwere feared
 as harbingers of disasterand death.
 After the war was over,
 they decided to hidetheir special powers.
 If anyone knew of their secret,only death could be expected.
 I'm sure that boy went throughso much suffering as well.
 The greater your power,the more you were feared.
 My mother had the Kekkei Genkai.
 She kept it secret from my father.
 She hoped that for a while…
 No, she must have thought thatthey could have a simple life forever.
 Look, Mommy! Look!
 Isn't it fantastic?
 Not you, too!
 Why? Why him, too?
 That hurts, Mommy!
 Sorry…
 I'm sorry, Haku…
 I'm sorry!
 However…
 Father had discovered our secret.
 When I came to…
 I had killed my own father.
 And that moment,what I thought of myself was that…
 no, that is what I had to think.
 And then knew that it wasthe most painful thing.
 The most…painful thing…?
 That I…
 that my existence didn't matterto anyone else in the world.
 Same with me.
 You told me that...
 You'll be the best Ninja in the village,and make everyone respect you.
 If someone comes along andaccepts you for who you are,
 no one could be more importantto you than that person.
 Even though he knew I was froma clan with Kekkei Genkai,
 Zabuza took me in.
 My power that everyone hated...He wanted it, needed it.
 Brats like you won't be neededby anyone and die like dogs.
 You have the same eyesas I do…
 Brat…
 Do you want…to be needed by someone?
 Are you willingto give everything for me?
 From now on,your power belongs to me.
 Come with me.
 I was so happy…
 Haku, bad news.
 I have to leave the Land of Wateras of tonight.
 However, I'll be back inthis land some day.
 I will rule over this land.
 To do that...
 what I need isn't consolation,encouragement or empty words.
 What I really need is…
 I already know.
 You have nothing to fear.
 I am your weapon, Zabuza.
 Keep me by you as a mere toolthat heeds your every word.
 You're a good boy!
 I apologize, Zabuza.
 I wasn't good enough to bethe tool you were looking for.
 Naruto!
 I want you…
 to kill me.
 Ninja Art, Summoning,Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
 Whatever you do won't work!
 You have absolutely no ideawhere I am now.
 However…
 I know exactly where you areand what you're about.
 Kakashi…
 You are completelyin my hands now.
 W-What is that racket?
 What... Just what's going on out there?
 If you can't use your eyes or ears,simply use your nose.
 That's what happens
 when you're closing your eyesin the midst of fog.
 This is the Summoning Jutsuspecialized for pursuit.
 I deliberately shed my own blood
 to stop your attacks both timesfor this.
 Your weapons have a thick scent ofmy blood on them now.
 Those are my adorable Ninja Dogs.
 And their sense of smellis without equal.
 You're the one whowas playing into my hands.
 The fog has lifted already.
 And your future is… 					death.
 I've had enough of your bluffs!
 Don't act tough!
 There's nothing you can doin this situation.
 Your death is certain.
 Zabuza.
 You were too full of yourself.
 You're too ambitiousfor your own good.
 You assassinated the Mizukage,but failed to pull off a coup.
 You left the service withfew men under you,
 and became a Rogue Ninja.
 Soon after, your name reachedour Hidden Leaf Village.
 You needed to raise fundsto strike back.
 And you needed to hide from
 the Tracking Unit'spursuit and retaliation.
 Isn't that about the reason
 why you hired yourself outto scum like Gato?
 Zabuza.
 Do you really believe I've managedto survive with just Sharingan?
 Here's something I didn't copy,a Jutsu of my own…
 To enlighten you!
 Lightning Blade!
 What the…?!
 His hand is visibly overflowingwith Chakra!
 You are too dangerous.
 Tazuna, the man you are tryingto assassinate
 is the symbol of courage in this land!
 The bridge he is buildingis the hope of this land!
 And your ambitions will sacrificecountless lives.
 That isn't how a Shinobiis supposed to behave.
 Who cares?
 I have always foughtfor my own ideals.
 And that will never ever change!
 I'll say it again.
 Huh?
 Give up.
 Your future is… 					death!
 Please kill me.
 What are you hesitating for?
 No…
 What you said is ridiculous!
 You're a weapon?Just a tool for him?
 How can you call himspecial to you?
 Are you really okay with that?
 Is that wrong?
 Huh?
 Tell me, what is wrong with that?
 Well, uh…
 It's not…
 Zabuza counts on me,even if I'm worthless.
 He made me feel needed.
 But now, I've lost my usefulnessthat affirmed my existence.
 Zabuza no longer needs me.
 That's why,I am now appealing to you.
 Please, make it quick
 W-Why did this happen?
 Is this what it means tobe a strong Ninja?
 To protect someone?
 Are you okay with that?
 Are you really okay with that?
 I don't get it.I can never accept that!

118,"Connecting old wordsthat have been used up
 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 Hurry!
 Right…
 We’re close!
 There are two enemies left…
 There are three of us…lt’s three against two.
 We might be able to do it withone more contact if we do it well.
 All right! All right!Let’s do it!
 No! It’s four against two!
 Okay, okay! I’m sorry.
 Counting Akamaru,it’s four against two!
 Let’s finish it quickly withour new technique next!
 Say, say. If necessary,I’ll do an awesome Shadow Clone,
 so it’ll be okay!
 That’s reassuring…
 But my strategy comes first. Got it?
 Y-Yeah…
 For that purpose,
 we have to catch upbefore the sun sets at any cost.
 I know. Full throttle!
 The sun’s starting to set…
 Neither Jirobo norKidomaru have come.
 It seems they’re havinga hard time.
 It doesn’t matter…More important is Lord Orochimaru.
 We’ve only completed one-thirdof the journey in half a day…
 They all have Curse Marks, huh…
 No questions asked, huh?
 This is gonna be differentthan that time before
 with your surprise attack…
 Too much interference…
 Yeah, this is bad…
 We don’t know whetherwe’ll make it in time at this rate!
 Damn! We still can’t catch up…
 No, this is good enough.
 We’ll maintain this distanceand continue the pursuit…
 Wh-What do you mean?
 I mean, we’re delayingthe attack until dawn breaks.
 Get real!We can’t afford such leisure !
 That’s right! Besides, if we’re goingto attack anyway,
 isn’t it more advantageousto use the darkness and attack?!
 For us, the darkness worksto our advantage
 only the momentwe launch the attack.
 It’d be close to impossibleto grab Sasuke,
 get away from them and escapeto a safe location
 in just that one moment.
 If we couldn’t get Sasukeback in that one moment,
 they’d probably just focuson guarding the coffin.
 If that happens, we wouldn’t standa chance in the darkness.
 On the contrary,
 for the part where they wouldn’thave to move needlessly,
 suddenly they’d get the advantage.
 It’d be a different storyif we had Neji’s Byakugan, but…
 Hey, come on.
 Aren’t you forgetting Akamaru’s noseand mine as well??
 I was sure to include your sensesof smell in the calculations!
 Even so, up ahead they havethe geographical advantage.
 Plus…
 if I can’t use my Jutsu,it’ll be no use.
 Even if I seal off their movementswith Shadow Possession Jutsu…
 the effect would be reduced to halfif clouds were to cover the moon.
 It’s a drag, but there are too manydangers, and uncertain elements.
 But!
 Got it!
 Naruto?
 You’re the leader…
 I’ll follow your instructions, Shikamaru!
 Right. I’m counting on you!
 The Vessel Arrives Too Late
 Hey, Tayuya!Will we really make it in time?
 I was just told to deliverMaster Sasuke by tomorrow.
 By tomorrow, huh?
 I can’t say that we havelots of time to spare,
 but I guess we’ll make it in time.
 I hope so.
 Lord Orochimaru…
 Sasuke…
 No Sasuke…yet?
 He’s running out of time…He can’t go on any longer.
 Lord Orochimaru…
 Several bodies have beenprepared for you!
 And…you could even use me,if necessary…
 It has to be Sasuke…
 How long do you think I’ve waited?
 It’s a matter of urgency!
 The Third Hokage’s Jutsu…
 His curse was strongerthan expected!
 Take this! Sealing Jutsu!Reaper Death Seal!
 Wh-What’s this sensation?
 Seal!
 My arm…
 If you don’t “reanimate” right now,you’ll lose everything!
 Is that what you want?!
 Lose everything…
 I’ve selected and preparedproficient bodies for you.
 Please leave it to me! Also…
 I’ll handle the recoveryof Sasuke as well.
 Shall I use Kimimaro?
 Curse you …
 Third Hokage!
 Release!
 Listen well, everyone!
 I shall release you from this prison…
 However, it’ll onlybe one of you!
 Now all that’s left is towake up Kimimaro, huh?
 Just as I thought…
 I wasn’t summoned this time, either.
 Dr. Kabuto, I…
 Take care of your body.
 Your role is now finished.
 It’s not Sound Ninja Five now,Kimimaro…
 I…still haven’t…
 Your replacement hasalready been found.
 He possesses power equalto your “Earth” Curse Mark.
 He has been giventhe “Heaven” Curse Mark.
 Additionally, he evenhas the Kekkei Genkai.
 Wonder who’s stronger…
 What’s the matter?Don’t get too excited.
 Dr. Kabuto…
 M-My life, how much do I have left?
 You shouldn’t talk anymore…
 P-People… People are bornwith some kind of meaning…
 Since people are born,
 there must be some kindof important calling.
 Recently I’ve started thinking so…
 That the meaning for being born…
 For people, finding the meaning is…
 the only freedom God has given.
 I understand what you want to say.
 Indeed, Lord Orochimaruis now suffering.
 It’s an unprecedenteddifficult situation,
 but I’ll mince no words.
 What can you do now?
 You’ve now lost your valueas a “vessel.”
 A new vessel is heading this way.
 Well…
 At this point in time,it’s too late, but…
 Okay! You said you were goingto let one person out of here.
 You’re going to keepyour promise.
 What’re you doing?Open the door now!
 What? There was another one?
 Hurry up and…
 No…I…I’ll be eaten here, right now…
 I’ll let you out of here…
 And I shall grant youjust one wish.
 My clan that was capturedfor your experiments.
 Please release them.
 Sure. Consider it done.
 You don’t have to worry.
 Your strong will is going to remainas Residual Aura inside me.
 It’s not like you’ll lose everything.
 Now then, your flesh is mine…
 With this, Lord Orochimaru’s bodywill, once again
 be unable to reanimatefor several years.
 However, there is the next time.
 I-Indeed…
 my body no longer has valueas a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.
 It will now be difficult for mewho has lost everything…
 to find my own calling.
 I’ve finally understood that…
 Even if it’s not me,
 I’ll bring in the new “vessel”even if it costs me my life.
 That’s my repayment toLord Orochimaru…
 That’s the only redemptionfor me for being worthless…
 Hold on a minute!
 Are we almost there?
 No… It should still take a while.
 More importantly…
 What were those idiotsJirobo and Kidomaru doing?!
 We caught up!
 All right! I’ll take care ofthis nice and quick!
 R-Right away?!
 Eat this!
 Multiple Fists Barrage!
 Chakra in his palm…?!
 Shadow Clone Transformation, eh?
 Rasengan!
 N-No way… His hands now…?!
 There’s no point ifI catch you before you do it!
 Now, Kiba!
 Tunneling Fang!
 This was also a Shadow Clone?!
 Luring Sakon into alignment with me…
 and aiming at me from the start?!
 You think you succeededjust with that?!
 Damn!
 I’ve been nailed.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!
 A diversion…
 He’s coming!
 Tayuya! What’re you doingidling away?!
 N-No!
 Why do you move forward?!
 I can’t dodge!
 Here you go!
 Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!
 Shikamaru! Let’s get out of here!
 Yeah!
 Punks…!
 You scums… Messing around with us.
 They were full of openingsjust as I thought.
 Having too much ability individuallyis also a problem…
 It went well.
 Yeah, it went just as calculated!
 Just in terms of teamwork,ours was way better than theirs.
 I won’t let you get away!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 Damn it! To come this farand have another one appear!
 On top of that, there’s something outof ordinary about this guy.
 What’s this bloodcurdling feelingon my back?
 Indeed, we are even on numbers,two against two.
 But this…
 I’m sorry, Naruto.He’s my miscalculation.

175,"I want to try and gatherthe unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to goon that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Hasn’t this increasedsince last month?
 Yes, it has.
 It’s now widely knownin distant lands
 that you were appointed to Hokage,Lady Tsunade.
 Bills have started to come in addressedto the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 Hokage is not something to take on.
 My name is Tsunade…
 I’m the Fifth Hokage ofthe Village Hidden in Leaves.
 My concern now is a debtthat absolutely will not go down…
 And…
 Grandma Tsunade!
 – Hey wait! 					– Naruto!
 – Lemme go! 					– Calm down!
 If there aren’t any missions,let me go search for Sasuke!
 You’ve been told to train,haven’t you, Naruto?!
 Grandma Tsunade!
 That…
 The Treasure Hunt is On!
 I won’t let you through!
 Goal!
 Too bad.
 But it’s totally obvious sinceit’s the same person doing it.
 There haven’t beenany missions lately, either.
 I wonder if the Pervy Sage willcome back soon…
 I can’t train by myself…
 What, there was someone herebefore me?
 Huh? Kiba… Akamaru…
 Here I thought I could takemy time to train.
 Are you by yourself?Where are Hinata and Shino?
 Shino is backing up another teamwith Kurenai Sensei…
 Hinata said she’d train at home.
 Is it like we’ve lost our jobs?
 Don’t say that…I’ll feel empty-hearted…
 Naruto! Kiba!
 Hinata…
 Weren’t you training at home?
 There was a call from the Hokage.She wants us to come immediately.
 Then…
 All right! Our first mission in a while!
 Treasure hunting?
 That’s right. This person here,an old acquaintance of mine,
 is our client this time around…
 My name is Agari Kaisen.
 Please look at this.
 This is a map indicatingthe location of the treasure.
 It seems a treasure worth severalhundred million ryo lies buried there.
 S-Several hundred million?!
 If I were to eat Ichiraku’sspecial portion ramen everyday…
 I don’t think you could eat all thateven if you spent your whole life eating…
 Awesome!
 But it’s on the map, right?
 Is this a job to go to the troubleof asking Shinobi to do?
 Yes. The treasure is in a locationdifficult for ordinary people to get to.
 Even I tried getting there…but there was no way.
 So it’s the Shinobi’s turn, huh?
 The deadline is in three days.
 If you succeed, there will bea special reward from Agari.
 Set out with caution!
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 Heh! A mission like this is a cinch!
 Indeed, it isn’t a difficult mission.
 However… if you fail…!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 – Yay, yay! 					– Hey, wait!
 If you fail…
 you will go back to the Academy!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 You’ll re-enroll in the Academy
 and re-do your Ninja trainingfrom square one.
 Wh-Why us…?
 I looked up your mission success rateover these past few months…
 Naruto! You’re decisively poor!
 What?!
 In particular, the success ratewhen you team up
 with Kiba Inuzuka and Hinata Hyugais hopelessly low!
 Now that she mentions it,
 it’s the members we failedan earlier mission with…
 We also failed before whenfour of us, including Shino,
 went looking for Bikochu Beetles…
 Something rings familiar, right?
 But, just Naruto aside,
 why should we also haveto go back to the Academy…?
 Collective responsibility is fundamentalin Ninja teams.
 Everyone takes responsibilityfor a failure.
 Got it?!
 It…it’ll be okay. No way should we failat hunting for treasure…
 If you don’t drag us down.
 What?! Don’t you be dragging us down!
 If we fail… we’ll have to studywith these kids, right…?
 Hey, what’s up?
 Naruto, Kiba, Hinata,all three of you together?
 Iruka Sensei…
 You guys must have cometo miss the Academy, huh?
 You could come back if you like.
 I’ll never go back!
 What’s with them…?
 I’ll make this mission a successno matter what
 and put Grandma Tsunadeto shame!
 And I’ll have no part ofgoing back…
 to the Academy on accountof associating with you.
 The failures until noware a collective responsibility.
 It’s not just my responsibility!
 I don’t know about that.
 The success rate of our teamwithout you in it is high.
 Then I’ll prove on this mission
 who it is who really drags us down,believe it!
 That’s just what I want.
 I wonder if this will be okay?
 It’s a dead-end!
 So this is as far asthere’s a path, huh…?
 There’s a river up ahead.How should we cross it…?
 Then, here here.We should cut straight through, right?!
 Are you an idiot?Mountain terrain isn’t that simple.
 I would go…this way.
 Are you an idiot?That’s totally the long way around.
 Then you want to competeto see which is faster?
 No way will I lose!
 All right! The finish lineis that boulder!
 Start! Let’s go, Akamaru!
 This will be a cinch!
 What? What?
 Wait, Naruto!
 Naruto…
 What?
 It seems we’re climbing upquite a bit…
 It’s okay!
 Naruto!
 It’s…okay.
 We should be totally faster than Kiba, so…!
 Yes! I win!
 Something smells good…
 Huh?
 So you finally made it, huh?
 Kiba!
 You were so late I went aheadand got some food ready…
 Now then… which way?
 We should…we should just cut right though this!
 Naruto!
 Good grief…
 W-Water…
 Here, water.
 This way’s definitely faster!
 I sure slept well.
 Akamaru and I oftentrain in mountains like this…
 We know a lot more aboutthe mountains than you guys.
 Shut up!
 Shut up, I say!
 Don’t be acting all big just becauseyou won two or three times!
 Not two or three times.Five times!
 S-Stop it! Naruto! Kiba!
 Naruto and the othersshould be there pretty soon, huh…?
 This mission looks easy at a glance.
 But it won’t go that easily…
 They’ll probably realize that.
 A limestone cave, huh…?
 But…
 Geez, hurry up already!
 You said the buried treasure isin a limestone cave, right?
 Just a minute!
 The limestone cave is supposedto be further ahead.
 We shouldn’t have been ableto find it this easily…
 It’s not like there arethat many limestone caves!
 So here’s fine…
 Let’s go, Hinata.
 R-Right…
 H-Hey, wait, you two!
 I can’t see anything…
 Oh, it’s a dead-end…
 It can’t be!
 Naruto! Hinata!
 Look out! Run, you two!
 Wha--?
 This…couldn’t be over…
 That person said it’d be okayat just this extent…
 What happened…?
 By any chance,was an enemy after us?
 No…Akamaru’s sayinghe didn’t smell anyone.
 It was probably just an accident…
 I told you this wasn’t the right place!
 But, as a person,if you’re looking for a limestone cave
 and there’s one right in front of you,
 one would usually thinkthat’s the place, right?!
 Don’t be getting smart with me.Here I saved your butt!
 I didn’t ask you to save me.
 What?!
 Hey… you two…
 A shard from the ceilinghit you, huh…?
 You okay?
 It seems I’m the onedragging us down…
 Not at all!lf I had been more cautious…
 At the end of the day,it’s your fault, Naruto.
 Kiba!
 Nevertheless, I’ll have no part ofgoing back to the Academy
 on account of associatingwith you, Naruto…
 Akamaru and I will find the treasure.
 What’re you saying, Kiba?!
 There’s no point ifwe don’t all do it together!
 I’m…okay, so…
 From here on, there will be locationsall along the way so rough
 they are beyond comparisonto those up until this point…
 It’ll be nothing but places thatreally only a Shinobi can get through!
 It’d be absolutely impossiblefor someone with an injured leg.
 Oh…
 Besides… we can’t just leave someonewho’s injured, right?
 We need someone to stay with her.
 Then it doesn’t have to be me…
 Can you find the treasure by yourself?
 You can’t read a map worth a damnand you don’t know the mountains…
 To be straight…
 we’ve wasted a ton of timeon your account, so!
 Rest easy.
 After I find the treasure,
 you won’t have to go backto the Academy…
 Let’s go, Akamaru!
 H-Hey! Wait, Kiba!
 Damn it…!
 Now.
 Naruto!
 Huh?
 Are you awake, Naruto?
 Hinata…
 Naruto!
 There are…two Hinatas!
 Naruto…
 Naruto…
 Hinata, did you use a Clone Jutsu?
 Could it be… you were twins?!
 – No! 					– No!
 Then…
 One of you transformed into Hinatawith a Transformation Jutsu, huh…?
 I can’t…tell you apart at all…
 I’m the real one!
 I’m the real one!
 Your voices are alsoexactly the same!
 I know.
 At a time like this,
 I should ask a questionthat only the real one knows.
 I'll come right out and ask!What’s Hinata’s father’s name?
 – Hiashi Hyuga.– Hiashi Hyuga.
 Oh, yeah. As for me,I didn’t know Hinata’s father’s name.
 What?!
 – Naruto… 					– Naruto…
 At a time like this,if Kiba and Akamaru were here…
 Here they could tell by smellwhich one is the real one…
 Nope. It’d be impossible evenfor a Ninja Hound…
 What?
 This isn’t just an ordinaryTransformation Jutsu, so…
 Mister…As I recall,you’re the client this time around…
 What are you doing here?
 It wasn’t buried treasure that I wanted…
 It was your faces.
 Faces…?
 I already got…your face…
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki!
 That’s…me…
 I guess I’ll be setting outto get the last face…
 Leave it to me!
 This is the place…
 This inside of the caveis as the map says…
 There’s no doubt.
 It’s under this rock, huh?I’ll go in one shot!
 Huh?
 This, huh…?I found it surprisingly easy.
 What is it, Akamaru?
 Kiba? That’s you there, isn’t it, Kiba?
 Kiba…?
 Naruto…Hinata…
 I told you guys to goon back first, didn’t I?!
 Come on! Come on! Here we wentto the trouble of coming!
 This mission is for the three of us, so…
 Hinata… is your injury okay?
 Yeah…I became able to moveafter resting a bit, so…
 Wow! You already foundthe treasure?!
 Then let’s take it backto the village quick!
 Right…
 Wait… How did they get hereso fast without a map?
 And moreover,Naruto has zero sense of direction…
 And Hinata has an injured leg…
 Akamaru…doesn’t seem to be feelingany particular suspicion.
 Am I being paranoid…?
 It seems they’re back.
 Kiba! Akamaru!
 Heh! Didn’t we tell you?
 Even a Ninja Hound's nosecan’t tell the difference…
 Let’s begin.
 Face Copying Jutsu!
 What’s that…?
 We also copied faces like this.
 As you can see,
 when performingthe Face Copying Jutsu,
 the person being copiedmust be close by.
 And moreover,it takes a degree of time.
 But once a face has been copied once,it’s an impeccable Transformation Jutsu
 that is beyond evena family’s recognition.
 No way…
 Kiba! Wake up! Kiba!
 Wh-What the hell are you…?!
 I’m Kiba Inuzuka.
 You guys…
 What’s the big idea?!
 Kiba!
 Kiba!
 Those are the real ones, huh…?
 Who the hell are you guys?
 The name of our clanis the Kedouin Clan.
 We’re a clan that possessesthe secret Face Copying Jutsu.
 Why our faces?
 We’re going to return to the VillageHidden in Leaves in your place,
 and mess up the village good!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Like I said,
 nothing good ever comes froma mission together with you, Naruto.
 This isn’t the time to be complaining.
 They’re intending tohead for the village.
 Then, how do we get out of here?
 – Listen.– With Rasengan, I’ll…
 No good. They’ll notice.
 – I can…– Then use your Fang-Over-Fang.
 – It’d be the same, you idiot.– That's why I said…
 – Then, what do we do?– Use that, I’m telling you…
 Naruto!
 – Don’t stop me, Hinata.– Don’t stop me, Hinata.
 Not that, I mean I’ll…
 – Oh, that. 					– Oh, that.
 Next time: “Run, Dodge, Zigzag!Chase or be Chased!”

112,"Connecting old wordsthat have been used up
 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 Byakugan!
 Caught ’em!
 All right! All right!I’ll drag Sasuke back without fail!
 Naruto! Hate to tell you this,
 but I’m gonna demonstratemy new Jutsu right here!
 Me, too!
 Don’t be so hasty.
 As soon as preparations have been madeto implement my strategy…
 we’ll make direct contactwith the target!
 It looks like they haven’tnoticed us yet.
 Huh? Sasuke isn’t there.
 It appears that…
 he’s inside that “coffin.”
 What’s this?
 I poked the bush for kicks
 and out comes not even a snake,but just two bugs.
 Hey, wait a minute! Wait!
 We didn’t come here to fight.
 We just came here to negotiate!
 Huh, then…
 What are they?!
 There’s no pointto that Smoke Bomb.
 You can’t run away from me.
 It’s string that's thinner and strongerthan wire that you can hardly see.
 My string is placed all over this place.
 Darn.
 Those two types of wireson the trap were on purpose…
 It was actually a triple trap.
 Darn.
 Didn’t think they had onewith such ability in the group…
 You will be…!
 What’s going on...? My body…
 Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!
 But… There is one withability like this, too.
 Thanks for getting caught so nicelyin my strategy.
 Darn… But...
 I have this kind of ability, too.
 Where did it come from?
 Earth Style Barrier!
 Earth Dome Prison!
 Squad Mutiny: Everything Falls Apart!
 Darn!
 Where is this?
 Inside of that big guy’s barrier.
 Darn!
 These guys are mine.I want to recover as much as possible.
 Once you’re done eating,catch up with us,
 we’re going ahead.
 Come quickly.
 Let us out! You!
 Be quiet, Naruto!
 From the looks of it,it just looks like a dirt wall…
 It’s their Jutsu,there must be some kind of trap.
 I don’t know what it’s made of,
 but we’re just going tohave to tear this wall down!
 Even thoughit’s dangerous to be careless,
 actually it’s more dangerousto remain silent here.
 Tunneling Fang!
 The wall is restoring itself…
 Hey…
 I saw that.
 Let us out!
 It’s not just a dirt wall, after all.
 Byakugan!
 Th-This is…
 What is it ? What’s happening?
 This is bad.Chakra’s getting sucked up…
 Darn… I didn’t expect thatthey would just keep us in the barrier,
 but I didn’t predict thatthey would suck our Chakra either.
 Man. How dare they!Let us out of here already!
 I’ve had a good amount of Chakra.Thank you for the meal.
 I feel like my body energyis being sucked out.
 It won’t be good ifwe stay like this here, Shikamaru.
 It was careless to get caught
 before we even figured outour enemy’s powers.
 On top of all that…inside here.
 Darn! I’m going to make an air holebefore all my Chakra is gone!
 Akamaru!
 The Food Pills!
 Akamaru!Human Mimicry Ninja Art!
 And for me,Beast Mimicry Ninja Art!
 Fang Over Fang!
 All right! Good going, Kiba.
 It’s useless…
 Darn! It starts to restorethe moment it’s hit.
 Same with the ground.
 At this rate, we won’t be able tokeep up for another ten minutes.
 We’ll lose all our Chakraand be totally annihilated…
 I can’t use the Rasengan thatrequires extremely difficult Chakra control
 especially in a place like thisthat sucks the Chakra out of us.
 Darn!
 Hey, I want you to listen to me!I want to talk to your leader.
 We won’t go after Sasuke anymore,so let us out of here!
 Hey…
 Shikamaru, what are you saying?
 Pleading for your life,how interesting…
 But you guys are my prey,I can’t let you out.
 Then…just let me out on my own.
 This battle…
 is such a pain.
 You! Do you knowwhat you’re saying?
 Shut up, Kiba, be quiet…
 What?!
 A split in the group, huh?
 Seems like you’re the leader, but…
 I didn’t think you would bethe only one begging for your life!
 You really see a human’s true naturewhen one is pushed to the edge of death.
 You’re such a low-life creature,
 you’re not qualified to be responsiblefor the lives of your platoon members.
 I’ve saved the mostimportant thing for last…
 To abandon Sasuke andto even sell out on your own platoon…
 Is that what it meansto be a Chunin of the Leaf?
 Sasuke is a Shinobi ofthe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 He is a comrade!
 Therefore, I will put my life on the lineto help him!
 That's the way of the Leaf Village.
 Someone like you deserves to die…I won’t let you out.
 Shikamaru! I believed in you,but now I’ve lost confidence in you!
 Let’s take this outside!
 Hey, we can’t get out!You fool!
 That’s why we’re in this situation!
 What do you mean by ""fool""?
 I’m just speaking the truth, fool!
 Oh! You said ""fool"" again!
 Everybody, be quiet for a second!
 Choji?
 Now he’s squatting down.What is he thinking?
 Hey! Why are you eating snacksall of a sudden?!
 Choji binge eats when he gets upset…
 Geez, another useless guy.
 It can’t be helped!ln this case, Shadow Clone…!
 Stop it.
 The enemy’s Chakra is placedall over that wall.
 Even if you are able to scratch it,the wall will restore itself right away.
 In other words, it’s uselessunless we can attack it
 with a Taijutsu that has enough powerto destroy this wall with one blow.
 Somebody that has a Taijutsuwith greater destructive power than mine
 would be Choji, but…
 At this rate…
 Darn, what do we do!
 Neji… I’m sorry, but can you usethe rest of the Chakra you have
 to observe the wall behind youand the wall behind Choji?
 I got it.
 Shikamaru! You be quiet!
 Naruto!
 You still don’t understand?!
 Remember what Shikamaru saidwhen he gathered everyone!
 Even I can't just sit backand be a sluggard.
 Because I'm responsiblefor your lives.
 Choji, don’t raise your voicetoo much from here.
 Kiba, dent that wallbehind Neji and Choji again!
 Y-Yeah…
 Huh! I don’t fully understandwhat’s going on,
 but I’ll go wild one more time!
 Tunneling Fang!
 Huh! No matter how hard you try,it’s useless!
 Huh, I see…
 It’s over there.
 Neji!
 Mark that spot with the Kunai Knife.
 Choji, are you ready?!
 Okay! Any time!
 All right, let’s do this.
 What’s happening?!
 Like I said earlier,the wall’s surface is planted with Chakra.
 But even this tough wall could havean area that have a thin layer of Chakra.
 That is what Shikamaru speculated.
 How…How did you get all of that?
 Think about what happened earlier.
 Because he noticed thatthere were areas that restored quickly
 and others that didn’t so quickly
 when Kiba and Akamaru attackedthe wall surface.
 In other words, he guessed thatthose areas that didn’t restore quickly
 probably has a thin layerof Chakra.
 On top of all that,by cleverly talking to the enemy,
 he figured out the positionof the enemy outside of the wall.
 He guessed thatthe wall furthest from the enemy
 probably had the thinnest pointof Chakra,
 so that’s what he wanted to confirm.
 That’s what it is, correct?
 I see, in order to trick the enemy,you must trick your friends first.
 I didn’t see that there wassuch a plan behind that conversation.
 Then, Choji realized the plan
 and the reason why he was eatingwas to replenish his Chakra.
 These two…
 They haven’t been working togetheras a team all these years for nothing.
 I’m depending on you, Choji.
 Yeah!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 All right, let’s go!
 Human Boulder!
 What?!
 Choji… You are awesome, after all!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a personbroken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around (round around)
 Shake shake shakeLet’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Huh? What are you sayingall of a sudden, Choji!
 There’s no way that’s possible!
 But, Choji is right.
 If we keep lagging, we won’t be ableto catch up with Sasuke.
 But still…
 Don’t worry. I have an idea.
 Choji, are you possibly thinking…
 Do you have a plan or something?
 Yeah.
 Hey! Choji!
 That’s right!I have that secret weapon of mine!
 Next time:“Full Throttle Power! Choji Ablaze!”
 I’m the one who will defeat that guy!

 The distance created between usbecame too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouthmakes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile,even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Sure enough, I just can’t getinto training by myself.
 As for the Pervy Sage…
 I wonder what he’s doing and where?
 And what happened to himwatching my training?! Damn it!
 What’s she doing?
 Wow, are you painting a picture?
 Huh?!
 There’s nothing like rain cloudsin the sky.
 Wha--?
 The Hokage’s house!
 Hurry! Get a move on.
 Water, water, water!
 Right away!
 – Water Style!– Water Style!
 – Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!– Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!
 Whoa! You idiots.Not me, up on the roof!
 We’re very sorry!
 Right, keep it up.
 Yes, ma’am!
 As I thought, the thing I had fearedhas happened…
 Kurenai's Decision:Squad 8 Left Behind
 There she is.
 Hey! Wait up!
 Giving us trouble.
 Let’s hurry up and take her back.
 Right.
 Hey, wait!
 What’re you guys doing?!
 Anbu Black Ops?!
 Naruto Uzumaki,leave this place immediately.
 Huh?!
 As for her, what’d she do?
 It doesn’t concern you.
 Listen up. Don’t breathe a wordof what you saw here.
 Knock it off! Just a minute!
 Don’t get in our way!
 Oh! They vanished…
 Damn it! What’s going on?!
 Oh, important documents are soaked.
 This will have to be dried in the sun.
 I’ll take them outside.
 Thanks.
 ‘Morning.
 Oh, Kurenai Sensei.
 Is the Fifth Hokage in?
 Yes.
 So? Is there no change to your sentimentabout pulling out of Squad 8?
 No.
 Think about it carefully.
 Kiba, Shino, Hinata…
 You’re the one who recommendedthose guys lacking in experience
 for the Chunin Exam.
 You don’t care about them?
 But I must not leave thatproblem unresolved.
 It’s my responsibility, so…
 That incident was no fault of yours.
 If the Anbu Black Ops are involved,then is she a considerably bad person?
 Or was she involved in some kindof significant incident?
 What did you say?!
 Calm down, Kiba.
 Kiba, Hinata?
 Hey, Shino. Say that again!
 Very well. I said it’d be futile.
 How dare you say something like that…!
 Cut it out!
 Naruto.
 Calm down. What the hell’s wrong?
 We in Squad 8 were left highand dry by Kurenai Sensei.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 You see, Sensei spoke to usdirectly about it.
 My duty is completed.
 You will probably be provided withanother Jonin in charge eventually.
 Just a minute, Kurenai Sensei.
 Sensei…
 It’s written in stone.
 Our relationship is just that ofcommander and subordinate.
 It’s just the team formation changingas circumstances demand.
 And that was that.She didn’t even give us a reason.
 That was that?Are you guys going to accept that?
 Hell no! That’s why I’m saying we shouldmarch into the Hokage’s office and
 protest why she is removingKurenai Sensei from our Squad 8!
 Then this Shino says…
 I’m saying it’s futile.
 It’s because this might be somethingshe herself decided on.
 Pig-headed jerk…!
 Hinata, what do you think?
 I also want Kurenai Sensei to stayas our Jonin in charge…
 But…
 But what?!
 Kurenai Sensei might have some kindof reason of her own…
 Umm…
 So you’re the same as Shino, huh?
 No… Kiba!
 Just stop fighting already.I’ll do something about this.
 Naruto, you’re not even on this team.
 What’re you going to do?
 Leave it to me.
 I won’t let Kurenai Sensei quit,no matter what.
 I blurted out that they can leave it to me,but I don’t know.
 Hm?
 Kurenai Sensei.
 What’s she doing?
 All right, I should ask her directly.
 Umm, Sensei.
 Naruto.
 I heard from Kiba and the others.
 What?
 Don’t give up being in charge of Squad 8.
 They’re really depressed.
 That’s why you went tothe trouble of coming?
 Yeah. It seems they really revere you.
 I don’t know what you heardfrom those kids,
 but I can’t do that.
 I don’t deserve to.
 Deserve?
 Please tell them all for me.Tell them I’m never coming back.
 Sensei.
 Damn it. She hardly listened to me at all.
 Since it’s come to this,I guess I’ll try Grandma Tsunade directly.
 Naruto.
 Sakura!
 What is it?
 Kurenai Sensei says she’s goingto quit Squad 8,
 so I’m going to try askingGrandma Tsunade directly.
 I think that’d be useless… Probably.
 It’ll be okay.
 As for me, I know the place whereshe keeps her alcohol hidden,
 so if I threaten to reveal it to Shizune…
 What I meant was that she must havesome good reason for quitting.
 What? What? By any chance,do you know something, Sakura?
 Huh?
 You know something, right? Tell me.
 No, don’t know anything.
 Come on, tell me!
 You’re a pest.
 Would I ever do something like eavesdropon someone’s important talk?
 What? You eavesdropped?
 Yikes!
 You idiot. Don’t talk so loud!
 Yakumo?
 Yeah. If I remember correctly,that’s what she said.
 I am at fault for letting Yakumobecome like that.
 No, I’d say instead that she wasfine up until now
 because I put her in your custody…
 Shizune, how’re thenursing arrangements?
 A three-man team consisting of
 two Medical Ninja andone Anbu Black Ops member
 are keeping a 24-hour watch over herin a mountain cottage near Satomi Hill.
 Even so, you can’t rest easy?
 No.
 I want to take responsibilityin my own way.
 Speaking of Satomi Hill, this morning…
 The conditions are spot-on.
 What was the girl’s name again?
 Yakumo.
 Yakumo. Thanks, Sakura.
 Hey, Naruto.Don’t tell anyone I said anything!
 Yeah, I know.
 If that girl is Yakumo,
 then she might know somethingabout Kurenai Sensei.
 Lee, you are not stepping indeep enough.
 Right.
 Kurenai Yuhi.
 I make this request with full confidence
 that you are the best practitionerof Genjutsu in this village.
 Could you take charge of that girl?
 Who’s this girl?
 Yakumo Kurama.
 You know aboutthe Kurama Clan, don’t you?
 Yes.
 At one time, they were a clan excellingin Genjutsu
 and were a power inthe Village Hidden in the Leaves
 in the same way as the Uchiha Clan.
 But they haven’t been blessedin recent years with talent,
 their force has weakened and
 they have not been able toturn out Jonin-class Shinobi.
 Yakumo Kurama is the Kurama…
 Yes… She’s the only daughterof the Murakumo of the head family.
 She has health issues and isnot enrolled in the Academy.
 Then you want me to take charge of her
 and train her to bea practitioner of Genjutsu?
 No.
 There’s no doubt Yakumo’s latentGenjutsu powers are excellent.
 So much so that those in the clan
 put their dreams of rebuildingthe family on her.
 Was there some kind of problem?
 This is just between us.
 Yes.
 Yakumo’s parents, Murakumo Kuramaand his wife died, but…
 You okay? Don’t push yourself too hard.
 I’m okay. I’m fine.
 I’m just a bit out of breath.
 Listen to me, Yakumo.
 A Shinobi is not your only path.
 Huh?
 You’re a girl and you shouldhave many other ways to live.
 I want to become a Ninja!
 I heard there’s a student named Rock Leewho can’t use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu
 striving to be a Ninja just with Taijutsu.
 I may not have much physical strength,
 but I could become a Ninja if I were touse that power, right?
 A Ninja like you, Kurenai Sensei.
 I’m not a teacher like Guy.
 Unfortunately, I cannot train you.
 All right, that’s all for today.
 Thank you very much.
 Take a bath and get a good rest.
 Right. Good-bye.
 Lee has improved again, huh?
 I heard.lt seems you’re quitting Squad 8.
 I have no choice.
 Those who develop under meend up not developing.
 It’s not like that.
 Although they’re no match for my team,
 the growth of the Genin inyour team is striking.
 If that’s the case,it’s not because of my help.
 It’s the results of their own efforts.
 Hey, Kurenai.
 What do you think it is that we can do?
 As you say, Lee growing to that extentis due to his own efforts.
 All I did for him was to believe in him.
 We believe in our pupils evenat the cost of our lives.
 We just need to believe in themwith all our power,
 and embrace them with all our power.
 It’s not a difficult thing in the least.
 Guy, I envy you…
 I couldn’t even do something that simple.
 Hey, Kurenai.
 Believe in yourself!
 From where and how are Kurenai Sensei
 and that girl fromthis morning connected?
 It would seem to be worth looking into.
 That must bethe Satomi Hill mountain cottage.
 Satomi Hill Cottage
 The east trap?
 So it seems.
 An intruder?
 Yes.
 Kurenai.
 Good work on your 24-hour guard.I came to visit Yakumo.
 This late at night?
 Yakumo is resting inside.
 Could you guys step away for a bit?I want to talk to her alone.
 Yes, ma’am.
 Don’t be long.
 I’ll be done in ten minutes.
 Fine.
 Nothing but creepy paintings.
 Please, Sensei!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Whoa, my heart, my heart!
 Huh? There’s nothing wrong.
 Hey, it’s you again?!
 To think you’d transform into Kurenaiwith a Transformation Jutsu.
 Hey, what the heck was that earlier?
 Shut up! For your sake,don’t be nosing around needlessly.
 Hey.
 You’re Yakumo. Right?
 I want to ask you somethingabout Kurenai Sensei!
 Damn it.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Why am I sleeping in a place like this?
 It’s because you trespassedinto the cottage
 under special security, remember?!
 Oh, right.
 Geez, really…
 Just be grateful you still have your life,the Anbu Black Ops are on this case.
 The Anbu Black Ops?
 That’s right, I have no time for this!

 Sorry Sakura, I have to askKurenai Sensei about Yakumo!

 He has the final enemy corneredin a dead-end valley.
 The area around the valleyis eerily calm.
 I don’t see his comrades.
 Is Shikamaru’s final move finished?
 No.
 We can’t state definitively thatthey’ve reached a deadlock.
 It’s because it’s possible thatthe battles thus far were diversions.
 Just a little more, Lee.
 It’ll be over once I connecttwo or three more muscles.
 Sakura’s Medical Ninja techniqueis really becoming…
 And yet I…
 The treatment is over for now.How do you fight to get like this?
 I’m sorry.
 You saved me.Thank you, Sakura.
 You’re welcome.
 Oh, you can’t, yet.
 As one of the Medical Team members,I prohibit you from fighting any further.
 No, please let me go.
 I can’t just leave Gaara like this…
 We’re Team Return-the-Favor, after all.
 The Ultimate Weapon Reborn
 Gaara, you may very well becalled the ultimate weapon,
 but have you not used up all ofyour sand in the fight earlier?
 This is my weapon.
 Indeed I have used up almost allof the sand with Chakra built up inside.
 But…
 No matter what Jutsu you use,I must not lose in a one-on-one battle.
 There’s nothing scary abouta Shinobi with no weapon!
 Come, Infinite Kujaku Armor!
 Fang Release: Dark Sword!Flying Double Edge Sword!
 You’ll realize that the likesof a mere Ninja
 is no match for the Ninja toolscreated by us artisans.
 Fang Release: Dark Sword!
 It seems your own body’s Chakrahas run out.
 You’re carryinga monster inside you, right?
 Now, isn’t it about timeyou used the power of Shukaku?
 You okay?
 Gaara Sensei is…
 Yeah, I know.
 Listen up.You hide in a safe place somewhere.
 Right.
 Although Gaara receivedSakura’s treatment, he's still…
 That’s as far as you go,ultimate weapon of the Sand Village!
 Damn it.
 Use the power of the Shukaku already.
 Hey!
 Hold it!
 Who are you?
 I’ll be your opponent from here on.
 You’re in the way, boy.
 Kujaku Hurricane!
 Damn it!
 Leaf Shinobi, you watch.
 The era of control bythe Five Great Nations will end.
 No, it won’t be just that.
 If the ultimate Ninja tool created bythe Artisan Village is completed,
 the existence of the Ninjawill no longer be necessary.
 What’re you talking about?!
 We are people from the Villageof Artisans who for many years
 have equally sharedexceptional Ninja tools
 with you in the Five Great Nations.
 However, each time relationsworsened between fellow villages,
 the Village of Artisans would be attacked
 over fear of Ninja tools crossingover to the other village.
 You Ninja of the Five Great Nationshave forgotten
 that you are kept alive by our power,
 and have returned the favorwith vengeance time and again.
 Although we the people ofthe Village of Artisans have advanced skills,
 we have had to survive by currying favorfrom the Five Great Nations!
 However, that era will now end!
 First, I will take out the Leaf Village.
 Fang Release Dark Sword!
 How long can you run away for?
 I’ll stake you like a shrike!
 What?!
 You!
 Gaara Sensei!
 Gaara Sensei’s sandprotected the Leaf Ninja.
 That dome created with hard mineralsin the ground mixed with sand…
 can’t be smashed by such junk.
 I’ll protect him until the end…
 with my power!
 Gaara Sensei!
 Don’t make me laugh!
 You, who are called the greatest creationof the Sand, a terrifying weapon,
 are going to protect someone else?
 And you’re going to usewhat little Chakra you have left
 for the sake of a comrade?
 But that will be your death!
 Gaara Sensei!
 With this,all preparations are complete.
 Damn it.
 Oh!
 Gaara!
 We were contacted by someonefrom the Village of Artisans.
 It seems ones calling themselvesthe Four Celestials,
 bearing long-withstanding hostilitiesagainst the Five Great Nations…
 have completed forbidden research andare attempting to resurrect
 the ultimate weapon of folklorein the village.
 It seems the villagers gotwind of the crisis
 and have evacuated toa different location.
 I see. So that’s why the villagewas completely empty.
 So what exactly is this ultimate weapon?
 The resurrection of Seimei,the founder of the Village of Artisans.
 Seimei?!
 Are you sayingthey’re trying to raise the dead?!
 I see. It makes sense thatthe mausoleum was violated.
 As for us, we must preventthe resurrection
 of the ultimate weapon at all costs.
 I understand. I’ll be off.
 Oh, hold on.
 Yes?
 I’ll be having one more personaccompany you on this mission.
 What? Who would that be?
 What we wanted wasthe Shukaku’s Chakra.
 What did you say?
 How we’ve waited for this time.
 Now Gaara, turn into the Shukaku now.
 And infuse me with that power.
 Gaara!
 I’ll save you now.
 Naruto!
 Matsuri, take this.
 My rope javelin.
 The optic nerves have connected…
 Open…
 third eye!
 Hey, you.
 What the heck do you intend to start?
 I’ll show you.
 The ultimate Ninja tool createdby Lord Seimei,
 the founder of our Village of Artisans.
 Ultimate Ninja tool?
 Now is the time of its completion.
 Gaara!
 Oh, Lord Seimei.
 Please take possession of my fleshand complete your resurrection!
 Oh!
 What’s going on? He vanished.
 The dead body came back to life!
 My name is Seimei.The founder of the Village of Artisans.
 A hundred years have passed and
 I have now been resurrectedas the ultimate Ninja tool
 of the Village of Artisans!
 What in the world is happening here?!
 My long-awaited wish has at lastcome to fruition.
 With this, my Village of Artisans will reignover the Shinobi apex.
 I see…
 So the monster from the Sand Villagebecame the source of my power.
 Say what?
 Hoko said this.
 There is a monster lyingwithin the body
 of the one called Gaarafrom the Sand Village.
 Once that person is in a cage,
 soon he will becomea complete monster, the Shukaku.
 I will take away what you couldconsider infinite Chakra from the Shukaku.
 I won’t let you do that!
 Damn it!
 Just wait, Gaara.I’ll get you out now.
 What a waste…
 Vortex Wind.
 I’m just getting started!
 What a fool!
 I’ll get you out now!
 Damn it, damn it!
 Gaara! Can you hear my voice?!
 Gaara, answer me!What’s going on in there?!
 Gaara!
 Gaara!
 N-Naruto…
 Shikamaru!
 What?
 Where are Gaara and Naruto?
 Neji, Hinata, tell me the situation.
 There’s a cage behind an areasurrounded by rocks…
 There’s a massive amount of Chakrabeing extracted from there.
 Gaara must be inside.
 Hey, Shikamaru!
 What?
 You know there’s a terrifying powerlying dormant inside Gaara, right?
 Yeah, generally.
 Something terrible will happen…
 if Gaara has Chakra extracted like thisand he loses himself!
 The Shukaku that had been keptunder control will go out of control.
 Once it starts going berserk,there will be no way to stop Gaara.
 For real?
 I must not waste any more time.
 The entertainment ends here.
 Hot-hot-hot-hot.
 Damn it! Just wait, Gaara!
 I’ll get you out now!
 You’re a pest!
 Give it up already!
 I’m just getting started!
 Solid Blanks!
 Oh, how I have waited for this time.
 Now, Shukaku! Give me power!
 I feel it. This is an amazing power!
 Cut out the futile resistance.
 The power of the Shukakuis already mine!
 I declare war on the Five Great Nations.
 The Shinobi in the Five Great Nationswho made light of the Artisan Shinobi
 will fully realize the 100-year grudgeof the Artisan Ninja.
 And they will inevitablybecome our sacrifices.
 Knock it off!
 What?!
 We won’t hand over our powerto the likes of you.
 I won’t let you take away any moreof Gaara’s Chakra.
 You got that?!
 How can that person fightwhile getting that beaten up?
 Why do you go this far, kid?
 What is the monster ofthe Sand Village to you?
 Gaara…
 Gaara is an important comrade to me!
 He said he fights forthose important to him.
 Fights for someone important.
 Very well. Then die!
 What’re you doing, little girl?
 I finally figured out whatGaara Sensei taught me.
 Weapons took away the livesof my mother and father.
 But I can also protect those importantto me with a weapon!
 Foolishness.
 Damn it!
 It has finally begun, huh…?
 Gaara Sensei…
 Gaara!
 Gaara.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Hey, that’s…
 – We were too late.– Then, you mean…
 Yes. He is starting to transformto Shukaku.
 Damn! What should we do?
 This is bad.lf Gaara loses his conscious in that state,
 the true Shukaku will come out.
 When that happenshe won’t know a foe from friend,
 he will just destroy everything.
 All we can do is just stand hereand watch?!
 Next time: “Departure”

 Midair Dynamic Marking!
 Next, three twists!
 Aim carefully!
 Can one call that a walk?No, I don’t think one can.
 I can’t gather insects at ease.
 It’s so great…

 I hope you’ll findsomething like that too, Hinata.
 You're right…
 And, what is it?
 You had somethingto tell me, didn’t you?
 Umm…
 Yeah…
 So, using that as a hint,
 think about the fastest wayto get to the destination.
 Start!
 Everyone!
 I’m sorry this happens all the time,but class is over for today.
 Yippee!
 – Why? 					– Huh? Not again.
 The handout is your homework!
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 I’m so happy we didn’t havethe class for Taijutsu.
 But these days,class either finishes in the morning
 or we have the whole day off…
 I wonder if that’s really okay.
 What’s up with acting likea serious student?
 Right, Konohamaru?
 Huh?
 Konohamaru?
 Konohamaru!
 What do you think you’re doingwith Grandpa's things?!
 Honorable grandson…
 Those belong to my Grandpa!
 Where are you taking them?!
 Uh…you mean these?
 They are no longer used,
 so I thought I’d put them into storagein a different location.
 No longer used, you say…
 You think it’s okay to take Grandpa’sthings away without permission?!
 The Fifth Hokage will be usingthe chambers, you know.
 The Fifth Hokage?
 Y-Yes.
 The next Hokagehas finally been decided.
 The village can have peace of mind now.
 That person apparentlydoesn’t smoke tobacco…
 What do you mean, Fifth Hokage?!
 It’s too soon for that!
 When you depended onthe Old Man up to recently!
 What a lovely fragrance…
 Huh?!
 Wh-What are you doing?!
 That’s exactly my question for you!
 You perverted kid…
 I dare you to say that again!
 Huh? You want meto say it again?
 Per-vert-ed kid!
 Don’t call me that!
 Lady Tsunade!
 The elders are all waiting,so we had better hurry.
 Yes, I know.
 Be careful, little boy.
 Please be more consciousof your actions.
 I’m the personwho has to deal with the complaints…
 Okay, okay.
 I’m not a little boy!
 Who the heck are you?!
 That’s my question…
 Naruto!
 Konohamaru?
 Long time no see!
 Hey, more importantly, have you seena big-boobed, scary old lady…
 I mean, young lady?
 I did see her!
 – Where did she go?!– Who the heck is she?!
 Who is she?
 She has to goto the hospital straightaway!
 Hospital?
 That lady may not look it,
 but she’s an awesomeMedical Corps Ninja!
 She finally came back to the villageto become the Hokage, so…
 what is she taking her sweet time for?!
 Hokage…
 The Fifth Hokage.
 She better do whatshe promised to do.
 You’re lying…
 Huh?
 I don’t believe you!
 It’s a lie!
 What?
 There are seven birds within 50 metersbehind me in the direction of the “2.”
 Tenten…?
 Neji!
 I just heard that that Lady Tsunadehas returned!
 It’s the real McCoy.Wanna go see her?
 Sorry.
 But I’m not interested.
 Huh?
 So there were…
 eight birds, huh…
 Listen carefully, Tsunade.
 We must call the feudal lords
 and announce the fact thatthe Fifth Hokage has been chosen.
 We will start preparations todayfor the inauguration ceremony in the village.
 Feudal lords and ceremoniesare just a big pain.
 Tsunade!
 Yes, yes, I know…This is also the job of the Hokage.
 – Genma! 					– Here!
 – Aoba! 					– Here!
 Issue an official notice and
 convey this matter to those in the villagewithin the next few days.
 We must introduce the Fifth Hokage.
 – Yes, ma'am! 					– Yes, ma'am!
 I hate you, Grandpa!
 Why did you have to die?
 The Fifth Hokage…
 Gimme a break,my shoulders are so stiff.
 I wish I could just downa nice cup of hot sake and relax.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Wait a second!
 Before you do that,
 you have something else you need to do,Old Lady Tsunade!
 What was it?
 I told you, didn’t I?!
 About Kakashi Sensei andSasuke and Bushy Brow!
 Oh…right, right.
 Hey, if it isn’t Naruto!
 Huh? Shikamaru?
 Why are you in a place like this?
 That’s my question–
 Why are you in a place like this?
 I have no idea why,
 but my father told meto come along with him.
 What’s up with that?
 Long time no see, Lady Tsunade.
 Oh, the kid from the Nara Family, huh.
 Are you taking proper careof the deer?
 The antlers of the deer fromthat area make very good medicine.
 Yes, I’m somehow managing.
 Hey, Naruto, who’s that person
 who acts like sucha big shot when she's so young?
 That’s apparently the new Hokage.
 Huh?!
 Despite her appearance,she’s an old lady in her fifties.
 Yikes!
 Well, see you again sometime.
 Yes, ma’am.
 All right, to the hospital!
 See you later, Shikamaru.
 I’m will show you an awesomenew technique I learned!
 That’s the new Fifth Hokage…?
 Hey, Shikamaru.
 That person is the strongestand most beautiful person in the world.
 Huh?
 I mean, she’s the lone femaleamongst the Legendary Sannin.
 Huh… A female Hokage?
 I’m not very comfortable with women…
 Huh?
 Even though they're unusually frank,they always hang around and
 you're never quite surewhose side they're on.
 They always think they can makemen do whatever they want.
 Anyway, they’re just a pain.
 Hey Shikamaru…
 Without women,men wouldn’t be born.
 If women weren’t around,nothing good would come of men.
 No matter how hard-edgeda woman might be,
 she’ll show her gentle sideto the man she loves.
 I can’t believe that Pa’s saying that…
 when he's tied to Mom’s apron strings.
 You’ll understand onceyou reach that age.
 Oh no!
 Let’s hurry up andget our business done…
 because Mom will chew us outif we’re late.
 Hurry up, Shikamaru!
 Looks like nothing will comeof some men
 even if they have a woman.
 Konoha Hospital
 I’m coming in.
 Who are you…?
 What a beautiful woman…
 Sakura, Sakura!
 Everything will be all right now!
 I brought along an awesome person.
 Sasuke will be fine now!
 Naruto…
 Those two flowers aren’t fromthe same day.
 So this kid is coming hereevery day, huh…
 I heard from Guy Sensei…
 Please save Sasuke.
 OK, leave it to me.
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke, you…!
 Hmm, despite his appearance,that Naruto is pretty considerate.
 Huh?
 Next! Next!
 How disgraceful!
 To be taken down byjust two insurgents.
 And here I thought you were a genius.
 I’m sorry…
 All right! Kakashi Sensei’s done!
 Next, Bushy Brow!
 Please hurry up andtake a look at my disciple Lee!
 Lee!
 I brought Lady Tsunade here!
 That’s your disciple?
 Yes! My beloved, beloved disciple!
 I see…
 Naruto.
 Huh?
 Is it really okay for youto be idling away your time here like this?
 Uh, I almost forgot!
 I had an appointment tomeet Iruka Sensei!
 Go on!
 OK! I’ll leave the rest in your hands!
 All right!
 Hey, Naruto!
 You’re late, Iruka Sensei!
 Sorry, sorry.
 There were lots of things to dowith respect to the Fifth Hokage.
 I guess…
 Thanks for waiting!
 I’m digging in!
 Naruto.
 Huh…?
 You have really developed comparedto the time when you wanted this.
 I have, haven’t I?
 You think so too, right?
 This headband that I receivedfrom Iruka Sensei
 suits me perfectly, don’t you think?
 Stop being so cocky!
 You still have a long,long way to go!
 You have lots of work to do!
 Listen carefully, Naruto!
 The Leaf Village is ina very difficult situation right now.
 Starting with the Third Hokage,we lost many fine Shinobi.
 The current strength of the Leafis less than half what it normally is.
 Despite that, we must continueto carry out our missions.
 Why is that?
 If you don’t have enough manpower,you should turn it down.
 No, that won’t do…
 If we turn down our missions,
 it would be like announcingto other countries our weakened state.
 Even Kakashi Sensei who is still ailingwill probably be assigned to missions.
 I see…these are difficult times.
 Hey! This concerns you too!
 You need to play an active roleand carry out your duties
 in order to aid Lady Tsunade.
 Yeah.
 But, before I do that,I need to satisfy my stomach.
 That’s just like you.
 Do your best!
 Seconds!
 Hey, hey!How'd you finish so fast?!
 I'll be straight with you.
 Give up being a Shinobi.
 L-Lady Tsunade…don’t joke like that.
 There are numerous bone fragmentsin the area around important nerves.
 Moreover, they are deeply embedded.
 You’re not physically capableof carrying out the missions of a Shinobi.
 Come now, Lady Tsunade,don’t joke like that…
 Even if I were to operate…
 Don’t be fooled, Lee!
 That Lady Tsunade is an impostor!
 You changed yourselfusing the Transformation Jutsu,
 you evil woman!
 Who the heck are you?!
 Don’t I have any…chance?
 There is no one besides mewho is capable of doing the surgery
 and it would take too much time.
 Furthermore, there is a huge risk…
 Risk?
 The probability ofa successful surgery is 50% at best,
 and if it fails…
 You’ll die.
 Guy Sensei!
 I’m not at all readyto throw in the towel!
 Guy Sensei, what’s this god-awfulbitter rice dumpling?
 They are Youthful Vigor Herbal Pills.
 If you eat one hundred of them,they should heal your wound.
 I see, if I don’t eatone hundred of them,
 my wound won’t heal, right?
 N-Not in a single day!
 It’s better that you give up beinga Shinobi and look for a different path.
 Lee…
 Lee…
 If I knew this was going to happen,I shouldn’t have brought you to him.
 Don’t say that…!
 I am painfully aware of how you feel,but it’s better to be clear.
 Because it’s something he’ll haveto understand sooner or later.
 The longer we wait…
 the harder it will be for him.
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 Konohamaru, just come outfrom there already!
 Shut up!
 Listen, I'll treat you toa bowl of ramen!
 Don't want any!
 OK then. I'll add pork slices and eggs.
 You're such a pest!
 What did you just say?!
 In that case,I'll pull you out by force!
 Be ready for that!

 Huh? F-For real?!
 Don’t mess with amphibians…
 I’ll show you my terror!
 Yeah! Now you're talking.
 Hang on!
 Wh-What the…?
 You rat… Let go of me, huh!
 What is this? He got you, Chief Toad!
 You be quiet!
 Upsy!
 This isn’t accomplishing anything…
 What’s up withthat flabby bastard, really?
 In short, this is some kind of monster
 consisting of water gathered aroundits spiritual body at the core.
 Crap!
 I don’t really know what that means,
 but I guess I can’t do anythingabout that thing.
 Even though we pierce the monsterwith a dagger all we want,
 the monster will suck up ocean waterand come back to life…
 Then what should we do,Chief Toad?!
 The only thing we can do here is
 to somehow damagethe spiritual body at the “core.”
 Damage…? How?
 The opponent is a clump of water…
 Add heat and he’ll evaporate!
 The thoughts of fools mean nothing…
 The only thing you can do is tosurrender to me, I who control the ocean!
 Damn. You’re annoying.Let’s go, Naruto!
 What? Go? Where are you going?!
 Airhead! I’ll spew oil!
 Huh?
 Light a fire witha Fire Style Jutsu!
 What?! I can’t doa Fire Style Jutsu!
 Here we go!
 What? Fire, fire, fire!
 How’s that?!
 What?!
 H-He did it… !
 Well done!
 Naruto…
 Im… Impossible!
 We did it, Chief Toad!
 How’s that!
 Chief Toad and me isthe strongest combination, after all!
 Naruto! You’re in a festive moodall by yourself,
 though I’m wondering ifyou’ve forgotten about something?
 Huh? Forgotten what?
 You called me to a place like this…
 Look, now I’ve got all ofthese goose bumps!
 You’ve always had all those warts…
 Shut up! I’ll have yousettle this properly!
 What?! Wha--?W-Wait Chief Toad! Wait!
 No use talking!
 It itches. I can’t take it!
 Something like this doesn’tsoothe my feelings but,
 my sons have caused you inconvenience,so I forgive you this time.
 See you!
 I’m sorry, Chief Toad… Help me…
 Now that we also got rid ofthe Sea Monster, Amachi…
 You’ll be taken tothe Village Hidden in the Leaves
 as the principle offender ofthe attacks on ships collecting funds.
 Shame! We had got kickedaround because of you!
 What are you doing?!lsaribi, kill these guys!
 I won’t!
 Have you forgotten?
 I am the only person whocan turn you back into a human!
 If I continue doing this,
 I’ll be a monster all the wayto my heart!
 That’s right, Isaribi!
 You’re neither a human beingnor fully integrated like me.
 The best you can do is to livethe rest of your life as a monster
 for your whole life!
 Well, from the very start,
 I hadn’t thought of a wayto turn you back into a human!
 Like I told you…
 I was intending to dissect you!
 No way…
 You!
 How rotten are you?!
 Stop it.
 Once we’ve returned tothe village, he’ll be punished harshly.
 Well… It’s about time you told us.
 Where…did Orochimaru go?
 You think I know somethinglike that?!
 You were tossed asideby Orochimaru.
 It serves you right to followafter him forever.
 You and I are different!
 I’ll be in charge of the research center
 and some day, will become an entitythat’d bring Orochimaru to shame.
 Really…
 Just for yourself. Not fair!
 And now, mission completed.Let’s return to the island!
 Not fair. I’m also sluga good one before that.
 Stop it!
 That’s the Jiro IslandAmachi was talking about…
 Here is the source of my nightmare…
 This place is where the fragmentsof my missing memories is left.
 Master Orochimaru…What in the world did you…?
 She’s alive…!
 She’s a lucky girl…
 After we tested ten,only one survived…
 I guess this experiment yieldedlittle something before I take my leave.
 Leave…?
 Because it looks likethere’s no reason to be here anymore…
 But, the research is still…
 That facility, do with itwhatever you want.
 I have no need for it anymore…
 – Why…? How could you do this?– Why…? How could you do this?
 – I always respected you, yet you…– I always respected you, yet you…
 You’re lacking many things.
 Motivation to desire the “power”…
 Tenacity…
 Hatred…
 Everything!
 But, let’s see…
 I suppose just the factthat you survived
 might mean you have some value…
 Say? Do you want to come with me…?
 I see…
 I’ll find a better-gifted child then…
 It connected…
 So bright…
 I wasn’t cast aside…
 I, on my own…
 by my own will… chose it!
 Hey, hey, where did Sensei go?
 When I woke up this morningshe wasn’t here…
 Will be right back!                            Anko		Leaving behind only		a note like this!
 Seriously…She sure is a fidgety person!
 What did you say?Who do you think you are?
 Whaddya mean?!
 What, you object?!
 Um…
 Really… Can I come with you?
 Don’t worry!
 There’s a very scary,
 but awesome Medical Ninjain Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 Yes, because Lady Tsunadeis a medical specialist.
 That’s right, Lady Tsunade is amazing!
 Surely she’ll do something for you!
 Relax and let us take care of it.
 Thank you.
 Hey, all of you!
 What are you doing?!The boat will leave!
 When did you…!
 What were you doing?!
 We’ve been waiting for youthis whole time, Sensei.
 Sorry, sorry…
 Wait! We’re getting on!
 Okay! We’re going hometo the Leaf Village!
 No doubt, you are hyperfrom the start to the finish…
 Do you know what being tired is?
 Any problem?
 I’m praising you! I appreciate it!
 Huh? Really?You’re embarrassing me.
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Guarding a high-profile individual.
 Sure has a nice ring to it, believe it!
 Yeah! A mission has finally comethat suits my ability!
 Just you wait,you great heir to a fortune!
 Now that I’ve taken this on,I’ll go through fire or water or…!
 Hey, what’s this?!
 Isn’t this just a D-rank missionwith babysitting?
 Next time: “Impossible!Celebrity Ninja Art: Money Style Jutsu!”

 Humans aren’t such a big deal

 Orochimaru's Shadow
 No way… What happenedto Iruka Sensei?
 Iruka’s scent ends right here…
 In any case,all we can do is search for him.
 Damn it. Where’s Iruka Sensei?!
 Iruka Sensei!
 What a relief!
 You’re safe!
 Somehow…
 Damn…that Mizuki…
 Iruka Sensei…
 That injury…
 Huh, this injury is nothing…
 Iruka Sensei!
 I’m all right…I just had a little rush of pain…
 Somebody’s approaching!
 What a reliefthe wound’s not deep.
 Yes…
 The atmosphere feels kind of heavy…
 Hmm…There must be somethingbetween those two…
 Well, what I think is…
 What’s up with the paw pad?
 Idiot! Look carefully!The little finger, the little finger!
 Little finger? Huh?!lruka Sensei’s?
 Well, my intuition tells methat it’s positive…
 Naruto, what are you twotalking about?
 Uh, nothing!
 Huh? Let me make an introduction.
 This is Tsubaki…Mizuki’s fiancée.
 Fiancée? Mizuki’s…?
 Ah, it’s negative…
 What’s up with that reaction?!
 Mizuki has caused problemsfor you again…
 I sincerely apologize for that.
 So you know aboutMizuki’s prison break…?
 Yes…
 He came by my house once…
 I became aware of that immediatelyand tried to stop him.
 But ultimately the resultwas that I allowed him to go…
 It really couldn’t be helpedin light of the situation…
 No. I should have triedeven harder to stop him.
 But I…
 Iruka, Naruto, I beg you!
 Please take me with you!
 Tsubaki…
 I understand that I’m makingan impossible request!
 But I want to stop him,no matter what!
 Iruka Sensei!
 Tsubaki, I understand how you feel.
 In that case…
 I’m sorry, but I cannot allow that.
 But why…?
 Why can’t she?!
 Naruto, we must hurry upand search for Mizuki!
 If she’s with us,she’ll interfere with our mission!
 But… But…!
 Iruka… If that’s the case,I think I'll be of service to you.
 I have an idea ofwhere he might be heading!
 Is that true, Tsubaki?!
 There’s probably no mistake…
 But…
 I beg you!
 I think it’s certain
 that he’ll use various tricks to camouflagehis tracks as he flees…
 If we spend time on that…it will all be too late!
 Please take me with you!
 Regarding the matter of Nara No. 23…
 Huh, what was the result?
 The Ninja Herb: Creeping Saxifrage…
 Huh?! Who are you!
 Dragon, Rooster, Dog…
 The lookouts have been taken down!
 It’s an intruder!
 What?!
 The Nara Clan’s research labwas attacked?!
 Yes… I just received a dispatchfrom the Nara Clan…
 According to the dispatch,
 the insurgent’s physical characteristicsmatch those of Mizuki.
 Mizuki’s…?
 Yes!
 What is that Naruto doing?
 But it’s something to have come upwith the idea of the Nara Clan’s institute…
 Notwithstanding the abundance ofnarcotic substances that are stored there,
 due to its remote mountain location,security is comparatively lax.
 And what substances were stolen?
 Well… Because of their thorough controlof the substances,
 they were able to determine immediatelywhich substances were taken…
 So the description matchedafter all, huh…
 But even if a mere Chunin wereto remove those narcotic substances
 what would he be ableto do with them?
 Oh… Thank you. You may go now…
 Yes ma’am!
 In any case,I can’t take any chances…
 There’s nothing I can do ifI don’t know what his objective is.
 If I can’t discern that fromthe actual materials…
 there may still be some means…
 Perhaps the proportionsof the formula,
 or possibly the orderin which they’re blended…
 There’s no mistake thatit’s this direction, right?
 Yes… Please continue toproceed just like this.
 Tsubaki, you said“It will all be too late.”
 But do you know whathis objective is?
 Probably… Although maybe not totally.
 Tsubaki, please tell us!
 In the past, he told me…
 ""I will get my hands on Orochimaru’s powerand go to where Orochimaru is.""
 What was that?!
 The reason he stolethe Scroll of Sealing
 was simply becausehe had chosen it as a hospitality gift…
 Tsubaki… You knew that?
 I didn’t convey it to the village…
 Just removing the Scroll of Sealingis a serious felony…
 And moreover, I was scared forwhat’d happen
 if his real objectivehad come to light…
 I believed that he wouldmend his ways.
 In that case you cannot avoidretribution either.
 I am prepared for it.
 I thought it was strange…
 If you knew where Mizuki was going,
 you should have pursued him alonein the first place.
 But you…
 I may not be able to stop him alone…
 I want to stop him at any cost…
 I don’t want him to commitany more crimes.
 Unbelievable!
 That Orochimaru…So this was his plan!
 However, could an ordinary Ninjareally manage to do this…?
 It’s something only within
 the realm of an experiencedartisan’s technique…
 I’m busy!
 I have a progress report onthe inmate prison break incident!
 All right… Enter!
 Yes, ma’am!
 We have just finishedrecapturing all inmates
 with the exception of three –Mizuki, Fujin and Raijin.
 Good work…
 We are now continuing to investigatethe other three…
 But, the last inmate we captured saidsomething that concerned me…
 Something that concerned you?
 Yes… He apparently saw the three ofthem fleeing together…
 Fujin and Raijin were fleeingwith Mizuki?!
 Damn it!
 Lady Tsunade…?
 I’m going out!
 Where are you going?
 There’s no need for you to come…
 If what he said is true,
 the guys I sent out won’t be ableto deal with the situation alone…
 Hey, Shikamaru…lf things continue like this…
 we’ll be in trouble!
 We’re already in trouble…
 Shikamaru… All the Chakra is…
 I know that…
 I’ve thought of several methods,
 but if I let go of these guys we aregonna find ourselves in trouble…
 You insolent jerk!
 Having said that,
 I can’t take them down simplyby catching them,
 so that’s why I’m doing this…
 I won’t let you leave here alive!
 These guys have monstrous stamina…
 And what’s more,
 although their bodieslook like rubber at first glance,
 with that much muscle strengththeir instantaneous reflexes
 are probably quite something too…
 In other words,
 you’re saying that this isthe only possible method…
 Let’s do our best, everyone!
 Sorry about this…
 What do you think, Mizuki?
 It’s no good…lt’s unfortunate but, he can no longer…
 I see…All right! Let’s withdraw!
 Hurry up!
 Yeah…
 It’s unfortunate but…
 guys who are of no useon the battleground
 only become a ball and chain…
 Even though it’s just a minor injury,
 you won’t be able to movefrom this place, can you?
 Who’s that?!
 Oh no! Is it Genjutsu Paralysis?!
 I saw that…
 No way… This can’t be, you’re…
 Orochimaru?!
 You are correct…
 This can’t be…Why are you here?
 Your whereabouts are supposedto be unknown!
 It doesn’t matter why…
 More importantly,
 I witnessed somethingvery interesting earlier on…
 You took the life ofan injured comrade, didn’t you?
 You saw that…?
 That piqued my interest…
 That’s not a sight one seesvery often among the Leaf Shinobi
 who devote their entire timeto playing house in the village…
 So what are you trying to say?!
 I didn’t do anything wrong!I had no choice but to do what I did!
 You’re a short-tempered child,aren’t you…?
 I’m not reproaching you.You were just carrying out your mission.
 That’s right…
 But… Is there anybody inthe Leaf Village who acknowledges you?
 What did you just do?!
 What in the world is this…?
 This is my present to you…
 Go visit that place if you feel like it.
 Here it is…
 Looks like there hasn’t beena trespasser here before me…
 The eighth one on the right…
 What’s happening?
 What is that power ofOrochimaru’s anyway?
 I don’t know either.
 And I don’t know whenhe encountered Orochimaru either…
 But I’m positive that the answer tothose questions is waiting just up ahead!
 That Scroll of Sealing incident…
 You must be angry about it,aren’t you, Naruto?
 I don’t care about that inthe least anymore…
 Because I repaid my debt to thatjerk Mizuki right there and then.
 But…
 But?
 If that guy is still connectedto Orochimaru,
 I need to ask him about something!
 Because there’s someoneI need to find at any cost!
 Sasuke…!
 It’s up there…
 All right!
 That’s everything…
 With this all…
 This will …
 This will make me perfect!
 This place is…
 That guy has done something…
 That smell gives me the shivers…
 Smell?
 I was wondering who that was…
 You guys are really persistent,aren’t you?
 Well, this is very convenient.
 Because I was intending to takeyou guys down anyway.
 Mizuki…
 You jerk!
 Mizuki… Your ambitions end here!
 Impudent as always, huh…However, you’re too late!
 Just like you always are…
 What is that?
 Beautiful, don’t you think?
 Damn it!
 You guys…should feel honoredto be my first prey…
 What?!
 That’s…almost like…
 But that’s they way it is,isn’t it, Naruto…?
 It’s true, you were actually special.
 But…
 Then that’s…
 Orochimaru’s power!
 Mizuki…
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 That’s what you meant bythe “invincible body”?
 No matter how much strengthyou gain,
 the kind of strength dependanton drugs can never be a true strength!
 Hah! Just like Iruka Sensei says!Orochimaru’s Drug?
 I’ll crush that kind of nonsense,so be prepared!

 Y-Yeah…!
 And…who are these guys here?
 Fujin and Raijin.
 Fujin…and Raijin?
 Yeah. They’re a little weak upstairs,but their brute strength…
 is Herculean, surpassing even thatof the Legendary Sannin.
 Are you serious?
 Damn… It looks like he really means it.
 Pretty amazing that they are ableto hold out
 against the Shadow Possession Jutsuonly by using their strength…
 It looks like this is gonna turninto a troublesome situation again…
 Leave this to us…You go pursue Mizuki!
 We’ll be fine!
 Leave it to us!
 Awright!
 But be careful!
 Those guys are crazy like monsters!
 Yeah… I can see that.

 His Jutsu are diverse.
 And moreover, the timing ofhis Jutsu are superb…
 I was really close to  being taken down…
 I wouldn’t have imagined that
 he could have such full commandof the high level Jutsu…that Mizuki.
 I guess I can praise you on catching thatthe Puppet was real.
 However… I wonder how long
 you’re gonna be able to continueto engage in my game, Iruka!
 Where’s this…?!
 This ain’t good…
 They’re able to repelShadow Possession Jutsu

 Shikamaru, I’ll go!

 How do you like my Jutsu, Iruka?
 Pretty good for being self-taught,wouldn’t you say?
 I can’t understand…
 You have the ability to usesuch high-level Ninjutsu to this degree…
 why would you waste it?!
 As always, trying to imposeyour morals on me, huh…?!
 You’re so lukewarm!You’re so naïve!
 Don’t you start preaching me!
 I won’t acknowledge you,no matter what!
 I consistently hardened my heartand carried out my missions…
 Despite that, those guys in the village…
 No matter how strong I was!
 No matter how many enemiesI took down in my missions!
 Those guys didn’t even attemptto acknowledge me!
 Saying we’re comrades,it’s all about teamwork…
 They were all boundby stupid rules!
 His target’s the Secret Manuscript.
 Backup Mizuki!
 Right!
 Hey! Are you all right?!
 I-I can’t feel my leg…
 What do you think, Mizuki?
 It’s no good.lt’s unfortunate, but he can no longer…
 I see…
 All right! Let’s withdraw!
 Hurry!
 Yeah…
 It’s unfortunate, but…
 Guys who are of no useon the battleground
 only become a ball and chain…
 Even though it’s just a minor injury,
 you won’t be able to movefrom this place…
 If you’re wanna blame someone,
 I suggest you blameyour own helpless self!
 I simply carried outmy mission faithfully.
 And despite that, those guysin the village…
 Not one of them even attemptedto acknowledge me…
 Why?! Why didn’t anybodyacknowledge my strength?!
 Why?! Iruka…!
 When you and even that Nine-Tailed bratare acknowledged, why only me…?
 It’s still not too late.
 If you pay for your crimesand start afresh,
 the people in the village will certainly…
 How cocky! Don’t preach to me!
 You’re just the same asthose other guys in the village!
 You disdain me, don’t you?!
 Mizuki…
 Everything…
 That’s right…Everything began that day…
 What are you gonna do,getting nervous now?
 Mizuki…
 It finally takes place tomorrow,doesn’t it?
 The Academy’s teacherrecruitment exam…
 Yeah… It’s weighing heavily on me.
 I’m envious of you.Your scores are better than mine.
 You’ll breeze right throughtomorrow’s exam.
 Not quite… Well, in any case,let’s both do our best!
 Yeah!
 Damn!
 Lie low!
 That was close, Iruka!
 Yeah…
 Mizuki… Thank you.You really helped me out!
 It’s mutual…Come on, let’s hurry!
 Ninja Academy 					Exam Results
 Number 7 - Iruka Umino
 I-I did it…
 I did it!
 Mizuki…
 Exam Office
 Now then, regarding Mizuki…we will adopt a wait-and-see attitude.
 Yes, it can’t be helped.
 I agree…The questions that were raised
 at the time of that mission torecover the Secret Manuscript…
 Until those are completely cleared up…lt can’t be helped, can it?
 According to the autopsy report…
 the cause of death to that corpsewas given as suffocation.
 In Mizuki and the others’ reports,
 it stated that the leg injurywas not that serious…
 I understand…
 He’s brilliant but it can’t be helped.
 I was just carrying out the missionthat I was assigned to do!
 Can you understand how miserablethe life I've led has been since then?!
 Huh? Iruka?!
 You have no idea, do you?
 I have undergoneso many hardships,
 and you, who has had it so easy…
 Which one of us is the true Shinobi…
 Let’s clarify that once and for all,shall we?!
 Now then come! Iruka!
 Mizuki… Where are you?!
 You don’t have any intentionof reforming yourself, do you?!
 Don’t make me say the same thingover and over again!
 Then I’ll bring this to an end now…
 It’s very unfortunate, though!
 What a tearjerker…
 It makes me happy too, Iruka…
 Elder Brother?!What’s the matter, Elder Brother?!
 Hey… You came back, Elder Brother!
 Uh, Elder Brother?
 What did you guys do to…to Elder Brother?!
 I hijacked him! Idiot!
 Wh-What the heck…?!
 What?!
 Elder Brother! Get up! Wake up!
 These guys!
 Owww…!
 Are you okay, Ino?
 I-I think I’m…
 not okay! My gorgeous face is…!
 Good grief… Gimme a break…
 C-Choji!
 Choji!
 Are you okay?!
 I-I’m fine…
 Sorry… Feels like I fell asleep a little.
 Hey, Elder Brother… You woke up.
 Damn. Can’t be helped…
 Guess I have no choice but to usethat thing.
 Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
 Elder Brother…!
 H-How dare you!
 We’re close. Mizuki may haveset a trap so be careful!
 I know that!

 Pitch black year round!
 But for that very reason thatI was able master techniques
 that an ordinary Shinobi wouldnot be able to possess…
 Even in this darkness…
 I can get an intense senseof your energy…
 What’s the matter?Are you done already?
 There’s no time to be spaced out, Iruka.
 I’m gonna take my timeand have fun with this…
 Take my time, got it?
 All right! Me too!
 Wait! If you go in there right nowusing Mind Transfer Jutsu,
 my Jutsu will affect you too!
 If you think you’re the only onewho’s learned a new Jutsu,
 you’re very wrong!

 Mind Destruction Jutsu!
 Wh-What’s the matter, Raijin?!
 R-Raijin… What are you doing?!
 Heh… Not bad…
 “Ino collection,”my new spring season Jutsu!
 We’re close!
 That’s it! That building!
 All right! Just one last spurt!
 How about it?Have your eyes adjusted a little?
 For guys like you who have livedtheir lives in the light,
 darkness is an inconvenience, isn’t it?
 Damn! Where are you?!
 Hey, Iruka, weren’t you saying that
 you were going to bring thisto an end ?
 I see! By end,
 you must have beentalking about yourself, huh?!
 Heh! Just a little bit!
 Hang in there, Ino!
 Leave it to me!
 Damn…!
 Damn! Unbelievable idiot strength!
 Th-Those jerks…
 I-I can’t hold them any longer!
 If we put a stop to the Jutsu right now,everything will go to waste…
 Think… Think about the next move…
 Bear with it, Ino!
 Leave it to me!
 You’re just gonna besent flying again!
 Ino, just be quiet and watch!
 Even the big-boned guy can makequite a showing once he decides to do it!

 It’s strange…
 Any hint of Mizuki in the airhas vanished…
 It’s too quiet…
 That’s not it…
 Even deeper…
 Footsteps? No… It’s not …
 It’s different from the soundof footsteps…
 Finer and smaller…
 Continuous…
 sound.
 Paper Bombs?!
 Wh-What is that…?!
 Wh-What happened here?!
 Iruka Sensei?!
 Iruka Sensei!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 No way! What happened tolruka Sensei?!
 The scent ends here.
 In any case,we just have to search the perimeter.
 Everything is in pieces. Damn it!
 Please be safe, Iruka Sensei!
 Hush! Be quiet, Naruto!
 We have a company.
 It seems someone is after us.

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 We now start the second testof the Chunin Exam!
 Look for the brats!
 Those three, right?
 All right! Let’s go!
 Okay! First we search for that thing.Can you do it, Hinata?
 Yes.
 Slow down, Lee! We just started.
 I know. But…
 I can’t stay still!
 Who knows what kind ofpowerful foe is waiting for us?!
 As you already understand,we have only one target!
 It sounds like they’ve already started.
 Huh? That was someone’sscream just now, right?
 I-I’m kinda getting nervous.
 I-It was nothing, Sakura. Believe it!
 I-I have to pee.
 Y-You… Fool!
 What are you doing in front of a lady!
 Go to the grass!
 Eat or be Eaten: Panic in the Forest
 Oh…! Ohhh...!
 Aaah… that was a lot!
 Feels much better!
 C’mon Naruto! I told you not to saythings like that in front of a lady--!
 What?!
 S-Sasuke…
 no matter what,you don’t have to go that far.
 W-What was that for?
 Where’s the real Naruto?!
 Huh?
 I don't know what the heckyou’re talking about!
 What happened to the scratchyou got earlier from the Proctor?!
 And…your Shuriken holsteris on your left leg.
 That guy’s right-handed.
 You’re worse at transformationthan Naruto, you phony!
 Unlucky me! In that case...
 Which one of you got  the scroll?!
 Since things have come to this,I’ll resort to force!
 Fire Style:Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 Heeeey! Sasuke!
 You’ve got to be kidding, loser.
 All right!
 I caught you off guard! Lucky!
 Paper Bomb…!
 This is lucky!
 I’ll kill you if you move!Calmly hand over the scroll!
 Sasuke!
 I won’t let you get away!
 Y-You’re always late Naruto!
 Absorption with my Chakra.
 Sasuke…
 Don’t just stand there, Sakura!
 No guarantee this guy's alone!
 Got it?!
 If you let your guard downyou’ll really get killed…
 It’s unlucky! I came on my ownto conceal my presence,
 but that became my enemy…
 He got away, huh…?
 If there’s an instance thatwe become separated,
 don’t trust him if he lookslike your teammate.
 Just like now there’s a possibility
 that an enemy will transformto get close to us!
 – Yeah. 					– So what do we do?
 We’ll decide on a password.
 Password?
 Listen, if the password is incorrect,no matter what he looks like…
 presume he is an enemy!
 I’ll only say it once, so listen closely.
 You ask, Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.”
 And the answer is this:
 “The chance to sneak up when a largenumber of enemies are making a scene.
 “The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 “It is important for a Shinobito know the right time.
 “The time when an enemy is tiredand drops his guard.”
 That’s it.
 Okay!
 Could you say it again?
 Huh?!
 I told you I’d only say it once.
 Could it be that you couldn’t memorize it?
 – You fool! 					– Huh?!
 I got it right away!
 I-I memorized it perfectly!
 I thought just in case,I’d listen one more time…
 I’ll carry the scroll!
 Hey, wait Sasuke.
 Ouch!
 What is it?
 A new enemy?!
 You guys go play around …
 I’ll go alone…
 Sakura!
 Sasuke!
 Don’t come closer!
 First the password…
 Ninja song, “Ninja Chance”!
 Ah! Umm…
 The chance to sneak up where a largenumber of enemies are making a scene.
 The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 It is important for a Shinobito know the right time.
 The time when an enemy is tiredand drops his guard.
 Good.
 Owwww!
 Hey everyone, are you okay?
 Naruto, wait!
 The password…
 I know…
 The chance to sneak up where a largenumber of enemies are making a scene.
 The quiet place has nosecret hideout.
 It is important for a Shinobito know the right time.
 The time when an enemyis tired and drops his guard.
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 What are you doing?!
 This time it’s someone whocan dodge my attack, huh?
 What are you saying, Sasuke?
 Naruto just saidthe password properly.
 He was able to say it, that’s the problem!
 – Huh?! 					– Wha--?
 Do you really think that guy canremember a password that long?
 Oh!
 If we asked the normal Narutowhat the password is,
 what do you think he’d say?
 “Sorry. I’ve forgotten it.”
 Besides, his movements whenhe avoided my attack…
 It was clearly differentfrom Naruto’s!
 Show your true self already,fake one!
 That’s how it is, huh…
 But if you knew he would forget it,
 why didn’t you makethe password shorter?
 I knew that you wereunderground
 eavesdropping onour conversation.
 So I chose that password on purpose.
 Oh really. So you’re not tiredor letting your guard down.
 This will be more fun than I thought.
 This person’s…too creepy!
 And where’s Naruto?
 Huh?
 Owww!
 And heave!
 Huh? Where are Sakuraand that Sasuke?
 H-Huge!
 This is the first time I’ve seen…a snake this huge!
 Behind?!
 T-Tail!
 You want our Earth Scroll,don’t you?
 ‘Cause you have the Heaven Scroll.
 Well, let’s begin…
 the battle for the Scrolls.
 Life or Death!
 Genjutsu?!
 No, that's not it.
 This is simplya thirst for blood.
 What’s going on?
 Just looking at her eyesmade me think of death.
 Who is this…woman?!
 Sa…kura…?
 It’s no good.
 We have no choice but to flee here.
 Unless we do, the only thingwaiting for us is…
 Death!
 Let me out! Hey!
 Spit... me... out!
 Darn!lt’s not going to work.
 Something else...
 Oh!
 The rice ball I took for lunch!
 Huh?!
 It’s dissolving!
 I’ll be digested just likethat rice ball eventually…
 N-No!
 Let me out! Let me... out!
 Can’t move already...?
 She’s going to kill me!
 Move…move…move…!
 Move!
 Move! Move!
 Move!
 Even if it’s just a little…Move!
 What do you intend to do... with that?
 I can’t move!
 Don’t worry.I’ll end this in a second.
 You won’t even havethe time to feel pain.
 I wanted you to entertain me more.
 It’s too bad.
 Am… I going to die here?
 Iruka Sensei
 Old Man Hokage…
 Konohamaru...
 Kakashi Sensei.
 Sakura.
 Sasuke.
 A lot happened between him and me.
 Even though we always squabbled,
 we cooperated and saved Kakashi Senseiin that encounter with Zabuza.
 During our Chakra training in forest,
 we competed each other andpracticed climbing up trees.
 That’s it! I haven’t…
 settled things with him yet!
 – More rice! 					– More rice!
 If this creature doesn’t want tospit me out …
 I’ll make it to do so at any cost!
 I see.
 Sasuke!
 He wounded himselfat the last moment…
 Move. Move. Move. 					Move...!
 Move!
 He wiped out the fear with pain.
 As expected,he’s not the average prey.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 I...am a Shinobi whowill become Hokage!
 I won’t put up with beingsnake dung in this place!
 Sasuke.
 Are you okay?
 If we don’t flee in a hurry,we’ll be discovered here, too.
 How do we flee…?
 How should we escape…?
 I’ve never seen Sasuke…
 so worked up.
 Sasuke, a snake!
 Shoot! I was too shaken upto notice the snake!
 Don’t come near me!
 Don’t lower your guard,not even for a moment…
 A prey must always stay tenseand try to flee desperately...
 before a predator.
 Ahh... Huh?!
 Sorry Sasuke..
 Naruto!
 The password… I forgot it!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Hey, hey , hey!
 It looks like you bulliedweaklings while I was gone.
 That explosion andthat huge snake,
 it's all your fault, isn't it?
 You darn snake bastard!
 Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki, is here,I'll wipe the floor with you!

 Your destiny is to lose to me.For sure.
 You don’t know until you try!
 Your father was killed a long time ago
 and I don’t know the extentof the pain you’ve felt…
 But it’s a huge mistake for you to thinkthat has determined your entire destiny!
 You’re hopeless…
 Proctor…it’s over.
 You failure…

 Don’t…run away.
 I won’t…run…
 I’ll…stand by my own words…
 That’s my Ninja Way!
 I’ll…
 stand…
 by my own…
 words!
 That’s my…Ninja Way…
 I think I’ve heard that line before…
 You with your destiny stuff…
 I won’t lose…
 to a jerk with cold feet like you,no matter what!
 Naruto…
 A brat who knows nothingshouldn’t lecture arrogantly!
 People are born burdened withan inherent destiny that they cannot defy.
 Neji…live…
 You’re a man who is blessedwith Hyuga ability
 more than anyone in the family…
 I wanted you…to be borninto the head family…
 You can’t possibly understand
 the destiny of being burdened witha mark that cannot be wiped off for life!
 Yeah…
 I do understand it.
 So…what of it?
 This brat!
 Don’t be acting cool…
 It’s not just you who’s special!
 Hinata was also…suffering the same as you!
 Even though she’s the head family,not being acknowledged as such…
 trying desperately to change herself…
 She fought you while coughingup blood with that in mind!
 You too!
 The branch family thatprotects the head family…
 Doing all that to Hinatajust because it’s an exam.
 In actuality, you were just as frantic
 in attempting to goagainst destiny, right?
 Vitality has returned to Hinata’s face!
 Just what I’d expect ofthe Anbu Black Ops…
 She'll be okay.
 Now she needs bed rest.
 Your 64 Chakra Points are now shut…
 How are you, who can’t use Chakrafor awhile, planning to fight?
 At the end of the day,
 you and Miss Hinata havethe same destiny!
 Shut up!
 With your Byakugan, labeling peopleand talking like you understand!
 Then…show me whether whatyou’re saying is true or not.
 I will! I’ll defeat you no matterwhat and prove that to you!
 Dang it… Dang it!
 That being said, I don’t feel Chakra at all.
 It feels like when I used upmy Chakra in the training.
 You possess two kinds of Chakra…
 You must extract and utilize, at any time,
 the other huge Chakra thathas rested inside you from the start…
 That’s it. The Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra…I’ll use that…
 Stinking fox… 					Help me out!
 This is as far as the talking goes.
 Proctor… I’m going to fight withthe intent to kill him!
 If you’re going to stop me,please feel free.
 Jeez.
 Didn’t I tell you it is pointless?
 This time, I really can’t lose!
 I’ll win no matter what!
 It’s futile…I pressed the Chakra Points…
 No matter what…
 Oh, yeah! Be sure to comewatch me kick that Neji’s butt!
 A failure beats downa genius with effort…
 His opponent might be me…
 But even if that’s you, Naruto,no hard feelings.
 Why do you try to go againstyour destiny that much?
 Because I was called…
 a failure!
 No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.
 What’s the meaning of this…?
 H-He…! 					What in the world…?!
 W-What is he…?!
 It can’t be… This Chakra!
 T-That’s…impossible!
 No way! His Chakra Pointshave been pressed!
 This Chakra…lt’s the Nine-Tailed Fox's, no doubt…
 When did he masterthe Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra…?!
 Here I go!
 It’s twisting…
 What’s that?!ls that even Chakra?!
 Awesome power.More so than during the training…
 I feel it!
 Rotation!
 What?!
 His speed’s gone up!What in the world is going on?!
 You!
 You’re confident in close combat, right?!
 You’re going to become the Hokage…?
 I don’t… think so.
 Only a very small percentage ofNinja are chosen to be the Hokage!
 Look more at reality!
 Those who become the Hokageare born with destiny.
 It’s not something you becomeby trying to become it.
 It’s determined by destiny.
 People must live withintheir different respective currents
 that can’t be gone against.
 I don’t know what theHyuga destiny of hatred is!
 But if you’re going to say it’s futile,you don’t have to do anything!
 This is bad! I must use the Rotation!
 After I become the Hokage…
 I’ll change Hyuga!
 What Chakra…
 That kid showed some enormous strength…
 The Hyuga kid is probably…
 Say! Which one’s Naruto?!
 I don’t know, either!
 Neji’s Rotation is a techniquewhere the body rotates,
 and dodges andrepels the opponent’s Chakra!
 It looks like there wasmore damage done to Naruto
 since he plunged right into the Rotation.
 There’s no Genin that can beat Neji…
 But Naruto, you’re incredible…
 To think you’d force him this far…
 Failure boy…Sorry, but this is the reality…
 Now this is really the en…
 My body…
 So he left a Shadow clone in the holeand spotted a chance to win, huh…
 Believing in victory,thinking about what’s next
 and acting even when gettingknocked around, huh…
 The power of believing in oneself.
 That becomes the powerto change destiny…
 He knows this…And he’s a natural to boot.
 In those conditions,
 you used the Shadow Clone Jutsujust like that…
 The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh?
 I was careless…
 I’ve…failed the graduationexam three times…
 As luck would have it,
 the Ninjutsu tests that appearedon the graduation exam were always…
 infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.
 Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu…I stunk at.
 Don’t be whining about boring stufflike destiny and what not,
 and how it can’t be changed!
 Because unlike me…you’re not a failure.

 Could it be that you’re helping outthe Medical Team, Sakura?
 Isn’t it lovely? I finally got the white coat.

 No. Dozaemon is a drowned body…
 Oh, never mind…

 Hey, this is a Leaf hospital.
 So people outside of the villagecan’t be admitted.
 Come on, just do this for me.
 I’ve got other business to attend to.So I leave the rest to you.
 Oh, hey, Naruto! Hold it!
 This is indeed the rare bambooI’ve heard about.
 Yeah, now I can eat the rare ramen!
 What’re you talking about?
 It takes three or four weeks to make
 the pickled bamboo shootsout of the rare bamboo.
 What?!
 First, I boil thisand then ferment it slowly.
 What, I can’t eat it right away?!
 You need a degree of determinationto eat delicious things.
 Naruto, so this is where you were.
 Hey, what’s up with you?
 What’s up, nothing, you jerk…
 Oww!

 and intend to eat ramenby yourself at your leisure?
 Ouch. That hurts.

 It seems he’s lost his memory.
 Lost his memory?
 Let’s call it a day.We’ll do more tomorrow.
 It seems he doesn’t remember anything.
 Not his name or address…
 If none the doctor’s Jutsu don’t work,then this is the real deal.
 Then, doesn’t he have somethingwe could use to identify him?
 Nope… This is all he had.
 What’s this?
 It’s a dove flute, also called an ocarina.
 Ocarina?
 It’s broken, though.
 Oh, it looks like this will stick.
 Not having memory could alsobe a temporary state of shock…
 Anyway, you sign this.

 A letter of undertaking.
 I told you earlier,but this is a Leaf hospital.
 Outsiders aren’t allowed.
 If something were to happen,
 you will take responsibilityfor everything, Naruto.
 What?!
 You got a problem?
 Fine, okay.
 I sure picked up something troublesome.
 What’s going on?!
 That’s in the direction of the hospital!
 Everyone, it’ll be okay.Please evacuate calmly.
 Help me!
 Forgive me… Forgive me.
 Is there anyone left?
 Anyone here?
 Sakura, did you evacuate everyone?
 I’m checking right now.
 Hey, Sakura!
 Naruto.
 Everything okay?
 Somehow.
 Hey, where is that guy?
 What?
 Come to think of it…
 He’s not here.
 Please help! My baby is…My baby is still inside!
 What did you say?!
 No way. It doesn’t look likewe can get in with these flames…
 What’re you doing?!Hurry up and put out the fire!
 I’ll go in!
 That’s reckless.
 The baby is in the deepest partof the hospital.
 What?
 It’s the sound of a flute.
 It's him!
 He’s getting closer.
 Here he comes!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – This way! 					– To the right.
 He did it! The baby is with him, too!
 All right!
 My boy!
 That was a close shave.
 Thank goodness!
 Thank you very much…Thank you!
 Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 An outsider with amnesia, huh?
 Good grief. What a dilemma.
 It’d be okay just to letthat one guy stay, right?
 We can’t do that.
 For the safety of the village,
 we must not overlook eventhe slightest thing.
 But, we figured out that
 he’s not a bad guyafter that incident, right?
 Unfortunately, we must not let someonewhose identity we don’t know
 stay in the village.
 Then, if he were to do something,
 I’ll take the responsibilityand figure something out.
 Sakura, how’s he doing?Has he remembered anything?
 No, nothing yet.
 I see.
 I’m begging you.I’ll let you guys have some of
 the rare pickled bambooshoot ramen too, Grandma.
 Rare…pickled bamboo shoots?
 Yeah. I went to pick some onthe way back from a mission
 and then found him--!
 That’s news to me.
 So you were loitering around likethat on your way back from a mission?
 Ouch. Oww.
 Naruto, so you’re serious aboutlooking after that boy, huh?
 Yeah, it’s true.
 All right, then I’ll let that boyremain in the village.
 Lady Tsunade!
 I can’t run out the personwho saved a child from this village.
 Excellent, Grandma.Now you’re talking!
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki…Nice to know you.
 I-I’m…
 Oh, that’s right.Your memory hasn’t come back yet.
 Then, hmmm.
 Menma, make it Menma.
 Menma?
 Yeah. I’d gone to pick someand then I found you, so…
 Menma…
 Okay, got it. My name’s Menma.
 It’s settled. Nice to meet you, Menma.
 Good to meet you, Naruto.
 Here you go.
 Wow, it looks delicious.
 The ramen here is the bestin the world, believe it.
 Let’s eat.
 Tasty.
 But this isn’t the finished product.Don’t you notice something lacking?
 Huh?
 Oh.
 Come to think of it, there isn’tany menma pickled bamboo shoots on top.
 Right. Until the rare pickledbamboo shoots are ready,
 they’re sealed from your ramen.
 Hey, old man, you’ll besure to make it, right?
 Absolutely.
 I can’t wait. Say, Menma.
 Let’s definitely come here togetherto have some at that time.
 Right.
 Okay, come on in.
 Excuse me for barging in.
 As of today, this is your home.
 It’s a dirty place,but make yourself comfortable.
 Whoa.
 It really is dirty.
 Don’t get so hung up on the details.
 Y-You’re right.
 More importantly, let’s get to sleep and
 starting tomorrow we’ll come up witha way to get your memory back.
 Right.
 I can’t eat anymore…
 Man, I slept well!
 Morning, Naruto.
 Menma?
 Whoa.
 Everything’s been cleaned up nicely!
 Did you do this?
 Yeah. I couldn’t sleep andhad time to kill.
 Thanks for that…
 Hey, Menma! What’re you doing?!
 What do you mean?I’m hanging up the laundry.
 Don’t wash someone else’s underwear!
 I’ll do that myself,so don’t worry about it!
 Really?
 Now then…How should we get your memory back?
 Oh, I know!
 Come with me, Menma.
 This is a specialty from the Land of Wind,Sand Dumplings.
 This fine soy powder is used toresemble sand and they taste really good.
 Yeah?
 And this one is a specialty fromthe Land of Earth, Stone Rice Cakes.
 The crunchy texture is irresistible.
 Uh-huh.
 And this is a specialty fromthe Land of Water, Mist Mitsumame Beans.
 So? Have you remembered anything?
 No… Nothing at all.
 Oh, I thought you mightremember something
 if they had a specialtyfrom your home.
 Sorry.
 No need to apologize.
 Naruto, forget about my memory.
 What?
 You see, we don’t know howor when my memory will come back.
 More importantly,you’ve got your own work, right?
 Well, you’ve got a point.
 I’ve got to finish cleaningthe Great Stone Faces by today…
 Then let’s do that.
 But before that, wait just a minute.
 Huh?
 Hey, Menma.
 Ma’am…
 I’ll carry your thingsto your house.
 Oh, thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 No problem.
 At any rate, you’ve sure gota lot of weeds growing in your yard.
 My lower back has beenbothering me lately…
 The grass grows as much as it wants.
 Then I’ll do it.
 Oh, my.
 I-I will, too!
 Thanks so much!
 Phew… Finally done!
 Naruto.
 What is it?
 They want help too!
 Huh?
 It seems this area hereis all homes of the elderly.
 Thanks.
 I leave it to you.
 F-For real?
 What’s this?
 Actually, thank-you gifts havebeen sent to Naruto and that boy
 from all over the village.
 What’re those two doing?
 But really, you’re sure an odd guy.
 Am I?
 You’ve got a strongsense of righteousness,
 I mean,you’re the embodiment of kindness.
 It’s not something easily done.
 I just want to live right.
 I don’t want to have any more regrets.
 Hm? Menma,have you remembered something?
 Huh? No, not really.
 I see.
 What?! Is it bird poop?
 It’s blood!
 Give me a hand, Menma!
 Right!
 What’s the matter?!
 Someone…in this village…
 Let’s get out of here!
 Menma, I leave this guy to you.
 Got it.
 Damn it!
 Damn you. Come on out!
 Damn it! Where’s he hiding?
 Naruto…
 Sound of a flute? Is it Menma?!
 Huh? What’s this…?
 Awesome power’s starting towell up in my whole body.
 All right.
 Awesome!
 Power’s flowing over me!
 I see you.
 Damn it.
 I did it.
 It’s a Substitution!
 Damn it. He got away, huh…?
 You okay, Naruto?
 Menma…
 That flute just now…
 Who in the world are you?
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 As I thought, he’s no ordinary man.
 He won’t be an easy opponent to fight.
 Wait a minute.
 You are talking about Menmalike his our enemy or something.
 There is that possibility, you know.
 He could be with the intruderfrom the other day.
 What are you talking about?
 Weren't you two gonna help usseek Menma's memory together?
 Our mission is to find outthe guy's identity
 and to catch the intruder.
 Unlike you, we don't trust Menma just yet.

 Sasuke!
 It will be necessary for youto die once…
 Die once, you said?
 Mind Awakening Pill.
 You will take these.
 Mind Awakening Pill…?What is that?
 Your Curse Mark level isat the first state…
 These pills will forcibly stimulate
 the power of the Curse Marksto the second state.
 However, if you move upto the second state,
 the Curse Mark’s erosionwill accelerate drastically
 and if things are left that wayyou will die immediately!
 However…
 In order to controlthe power of the second state,
 it is necessary to allow one’s bodyto get accustomed to it
 over the course of several hours.
 In doing so, you will…
 attain power that isequal to ours, however…
 Once awake, you can’t possiblylast more than a few minutes…
 and will certainly die!
 Sound vs. Leaf
 Die…and what will happen after that?
 You don’t need to worry.
 That’s why we’re here.
 We will use Barrier Ninjutsuto suppress the side effects.
 We will mitigate that phase
 to ease you from eternal deathto a state of half death.
 You really think I can put my faithin your Barrier Ninjutsu or whatever?
 Master Sasuke…
 We normally functionas Lord Orochimaru’s bodyguards!
 We know our stuff when it comesto Barrier or Defense Ninjutsu,
 Curse Marks and Sealing Jutsu!
 I absolutely cannot die yet!
 I’m counting on you.
 Hey!
 We’re gonna lose himif you guys are slow!
 Get into position!
 Begin!
 – Four Black Mists Formation!– Four Black Mists Formation!
 Black Seal!
 All right. We're done for now.
 Man, I’m exhausted.
 I didn’t think this missionwould drag on this long.
 I’ll go check out the situation.Let’s go, Raido!
 Right.
 Darn. This has sure gotten troublesome.
 There’s one…
 No, two of them.
 Here they come!
 You guys are Orochimaru’s…
 Judging from the directionyou came from,
 it appears that you are on your way backfrom the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 What’s in that barrel?
 Having two Jonin as opponents…
 That’s a tough one.
 Every one of themgot the Curse Marks…
 You refuse to answer?
 This will be different from that time beforewith your surprise attack.
 Shut up, you scum!
 Just drop dead!
 Orochimaru’s toys…
 Don’t you dare monkey aroundwith Leaf Shinobi!
 Those two are really late, aren’t they?
 What should we do, Shizune?
 Let’s go see!
 Right!
 Shikamaru!
 What’s the matter?
 There’s a smell of blood nearby.
 Wh-What’s this?!
 Raido! Genma!
 This isn’t good!
 I can’t believe these twocould have been taken down…!
 The best I can do right now isgive him some stop-gap treatment…
 Shizune…
 I’m gonna hunt those guys down!
 No!
 B-But…
 W-Wait…lwashi.
 Th-The Jutsu that those guys haveis no longer that of mere Shinobi…
 If you pursue them alone,you'll only die.
 Genma…don’t talk anymore!
 The smell of the other two impingedon the five others including Sasuke…
 But the five are moving awayfrom the smell of the blood!
 What should we do?!
 Just as I thought.He has guides.
 This has really turned intoa real pain in the neck.
 Let’s hurry up and pursue Sasuke!
 Shut up, Naruto!
 That’s for Shikamaru to decide!Don’t play the boss!
 Shikamaru?
 The fact that there wasthe smell of blood probably means
 that a battle occurred somewhere.
 If we go to that location we shouldbe able to gather some information…
 We must be attentiveas we near the location,
 so we would have to switch over to
 a reconnaissance patternand approach walking slowly…
 While all that’s going on
 Sasuke will cross overthe Land of Fire border!
 What are we gonna do, Shikamaru?!
 All right! Let’s pursue Sasuke!
 All right! That’s what I was waiting for!
 However…
 The fact that there was a battlemeans they’ll have their guard up.
 They’ll certainly be aware
 of the fact that there mightbe Ninja on their tail.
 In other words,
 the odds are high thatthere will be traps or an ambush.
 Listen carefully…
 Hereafter, I want you to use your visualand acoustic senses to the fullest!
 We need to locate those guys beforewe get caught in an ambush!
 And if we come acrossanything suspicious,
 don't just dodge them,interpret them!
 All right!
 When we find them,
 I’m gonna use my new Jutsuto clobber them!
 That Naruto…
 Each time I see himhe’s added a new Jutsu to his arsenal.
 Darn! Just when I thoughtI had caught up with him…
 Hey! The enemy’s smell is everywhere!
 Everybody! Stop!
 Take a careful look above you.
 Paper Bombs…
 And in five other places too!
 The figuration is that ofa Perimeter Barrier.
 Perimeter Barrier…?
 It’s one type of Booby Trap Ninjutsu!
 Perimeter-type traps have a time lagand are activated
 when one enters the area thathas been marked by the enemy.
 It’s advanced Jutsu…
 It was in one of the books thatmy father made me read.
 Darn! Our only choiceis to make a detour…
 Lee… Do what you have to do!
 Lee!
 It’s too soon to be doing that!
 Lady Fifth Hokage!
 I already know thatyou’re a foolhardy guy.
 But you’ve just had an operation.
 You don’t need to be rushinginto things.
 I want to hurry up anddo even a little training.
 I also want to… I want to…
 Building your strength isn’tthe only form of training.
 Don’t you agree?
 It is said that Ninja are those
 who can forebear andendure any hardship.
 I understand how you feel but…
 That means that this toois one kind of training.
 Training…
 What if you were to do something foolhardyand you got worse?
 Wh-What’s that?
 It’s medicine that I prepared.
 First, drink this and get better!
 Right!
 Come, let’s go…
 Yes, ma’am.
 Damn! Nothing but traps!
 Yeah, but the enemy seemspressed for time.
 The traps have noticeable flaws.
 Hey, hey, Naruto!There’s wire at your feet!
 Don’t trip on it!
 I know that already!
 Wait, Naruto!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu…
 M-Made it just in the nick of time.
 Naruto! I told you to be careful!
 I see… One of the wires isreadily visible because it reflects light.
 The other wire has been coatedwith a matte green.
 So it’s very difficult to seewith the naked eye.
 It’s a double trap, huh.
 Despite the fact thatthey’re in a hurry,
 that’s certainly an elaborate trap.
 Which means that…
 That they’re at rest.
 Perhaps they got injured,or that itself could be a trap…
 Byakugan!
 Caught ‘em!
 All right! All right!I’ll drag Sasuke back without fail!
 Naruto! Hate to tell you this,
 but I’m gonna demonstratemy new Jutsu right here!
 Me too!
 Don’t be so hasty.
 As soon as preparations have been madeto implement my strategy…
 we’ll make direct contactwith the target!
 Darn! When we’re in a hurry,having to take a darn break…
 It can’t be helped.
 When one fights at the second state,one’s body gets drained drastically.
 More than that,
 it’s an ordeal not to be ableto use one’s body for a while…
 It can’t be helped withtwo Jonin-class guys as the opponents.
 If we act in moderation,we’ll be done in.
 Kiba…
 In that event,
 don’t mess up the timingof the Smoke Bombs.
 Got it!
 Now then…
 we'll split up into two teams.
 – Right! 					– Okay!
 It looks like they haven’t noticed us yet.
 Hey, Sasuke's not around.
 It appears that…
 He’s inside that “coffin.”
 Is he dead?!
 That barrel is secured with Barriers.I can't see through it.
 I wouldn’t think that the guyswho wanted Sasuke
 would kill him that easily.
 You might be right about that.

 Gimme a break, Shikamaru!You're not reliable in the least!
 And you still call yourselfa leader?!
 But this situation sureis a problem.
 Leave this kind of thing to me.lt'll be a cinch.
 – I sure hope it will be.– What do you mean by that?!
 It's too much of a hassle to explain.

 one’s own soul is handed overto the Grim Reaper.

 Humph! I don’t care who it is!
 No!
 Your opponent is me!
 You…!
 Shino?
 Why are you here?!
 I put a female beetle on youbefore you left the arena.
 The females have almost no smell…
 Only a male can sniff outthe subtle smell of the female.
 Though the male itselfhas a strong smell…
 Sasuke Uchiha…You pursue Gaara.
 Because the battle between youand him hasn’t been settled yet.
 I’ll fight him, because originallyI was his opponent…
 I withdraw!Please go ahead with the match.
 Leave this to me here! Go!
 You’re very confident.But are you going to be okay?
 No need to worry.
 I’ll go back you up ifI have just ten minutes.
 Humph. By then, I’ll be done too.
 None of you know anything at all.
 You guys probably don’t knowof the real terror of this world.
 In that case…you’ll teach me that terror?
 No…
 If you defeat me and chase Gaara,you’ll be forced to know.
 That is, only if you can defeat me.

 Everyone makes mistakes It’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 You who are strong…You who are called Uchiha…
 You who have friends…You who have a purpose…
 You who are like me…
 By killing you, I can truly exist!
 Uchiha, you are my prey!

 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 Who’re you guys?
 I’m in a bad mood right now.
 If you wanna continue to fight,
 I won't go easy on you.
 You stop your babbling, weakling.
 Hey, come over here.
 I’m gonna playdo-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do on you…
 while I snap your ribs!
 I’ll do it!
 What?! He got both of my legswith his string…!
 Why you--!
 Humph! Let’s hear a nice sound.
 Do!
 W-What?!
 Re!
 Wh-Where is he attacking from?!
 Your bones makea really low sound, don’t they?
 Let’s hear a much sharper reverberation,shall we?
 Right?
 Next, I’ll go fora mi-fa-so tri-combination.
 Wha--?!
 What?!
 Last!
 Lions Barrage!
 An Invitation from the Sound
 Here you are!
 I’m digging in!
 Sakura! Go on, eat, eat!
 The Chinese-style barbecued porkramen noodles here are fabulous!
 Don’t worry. It’s my treat.
 Right, chef?
 You’re gonna treat your girl.
 You’re growing up, aren’t you, Naruto?
 Wh-Wh-What?!
 Wh-What the heck areyou talking about?
 I need to have an important conversationwith Sakura today…
 Sh-She’s not my girlor anything like that…
 Sakura?
 Sorry, Naruto. I was little spaced out.
 This looks delicious.
 Now then… Let’s eat! Let’s eat!
 Yeah! Tell me about Sasukewhile we eat.
 Sasuke told me not to tell you this,Naruto, but…
 It’s all that guy Orochimaru’s fault…
 S-Stop!
 Kakashi Sensei said it would be fineand I’d like to believe that too…
 But when he was battling Gaara…
 Earlier today…
 Sasuke was wearing the same expressionas the time before.
 That’s why I…
 Orochimaru, huh?I ran into him again a little while back.
 Really? Where?!
 When I was searching forOld Lady Tsunade…
 Die!
 Shoot!
 Pervy Sage and the old lady…
 Despite the fact thathe was fighting two of them at once,
 he was incredibly powerful.
 He’s one dangerous dude.
 That strong…
 It’ll all be fine, believe it!
 Sasuke wouldn’t fall tothat kind of guy’s enticement.
 He’s already a really powerful guy,
 so he wouldn’t need to dothat kind of thing!
 I guarantee it!
 Yeah!
 Why does Master Orochimaruwant this guy anyway?
 Kimimaro would havebeen much better…
 Well, if you stay ina seedy place like this,
 you’ll just remain mediocre at best.
 You’ll never become strong…
 Wh-Why…?
 All my barrages were solid.Yet this guy…
 doesn't seem to havesustained any damage.
 If you keep on fooling aroundplaying Ninja with your friends,
 you’re just gonna continue to rot.
 Come with us.
 If you do,Master Orochimaru will empower you.
 There’s no meaningif we take you by force, he said.
 You decide.
 Gimme a break…
 Master Orochimaru sure sent meon a bothersome mission.
 Hey! What did you decide?
 Are you coming?
 Or are you not coming?!
 Decide already!
 When a weakling like you lags,
 it makes me wanna just finish you!
 Try me…!
 You…those Curse Marks…
 Don’t be so sure that
 you’re the only favoriteof Master Orochimaru.
 One shouldn’t use Curse Marksthat lightly.
 Or rather…it looks like you’re noteven able to control the Curse Marks.
 If they continue to be releasedfor a long period of time,
 Curse Marks will progressivelyeat your body.
 It looks like you’re still at first state,
 so the speed at which they willeat away at you is still fairly slow.
 But when they have entirely eaten you,
 you will lose yourself.
 Forever.
 In exchange for having beenempowered by Curse Marks,
 you will be tetheredby Master Orochimaru.
 We no longer have anythinglike freedom.
 In order to receive something,one must discard something.
 What is your objective?
 Are you and your comradesjust going to comfort each other
 in this lukewarm village…
 then simply forget all about…
 Itachi Uchiha?
 Don’t forget your objective.
 This kind of village doesnothing more than shackle you!
 Cut your stupid ties with this place.
 If you do that, you’ll…
 be able to obtain much,more fabulous power.
 Don’t forget your objective!
 Thanks!
 H-Hey Sakura.
 I’ll walk you home!
 Huh? Don’t worry about it.
 Why, why?The streets are dangerous at night!
 They’re well lit, so I’ll be fine…
 Sakura?
 Thanks, Naruto.
 But I want to go home alone tonight.
 I see…
 I’ll be fine!
 Yeah!
 Why are you hanging around in a placelike this in the middle of the night?
 One has to pass down this roadto leave the village.
 Go home and sleep.
 Why…
 Why won’t you tell me anything?
 Why are you always silent like that?
 You won’t tell me one single thing.
 Why should I have to tell you anything?!
 I’m telling you to keep your noseout of my business.
 Stop bothering meover everything I do.
 I…make you dislike meall the time, don’t I?
 Do you remember?
 We just became Genin andthe Three-Man Squads were assigned…
 You and I were alone forthe first time, here at this very spot.
 You got mad at me.
 See! That guy doesn’thave parents, right?
 He’s all alone and he doesn’t have to dealwith parents lecturing him…
 That’s why he can sometimesbe selfish!
 Solitude…
 Huh?
 Isn’t the same as being scoldedby one’s parents.
 What’s the matter all of a sudden….
 You…are annoying…
 I don’t remember that.
 Yeah, I guess…that was long ago, after all…
 But it all began that day.
 Sasuke and me…
 And also Naruto and Kakashi Sensei…
 The four of us wenton various missions, didn’t we?
 Those were tough anddifficult times, but…
 But…
 more than anything…
 it was so much fun!
 I know about your family, Sasuke…
 But revenge…
 that won’t bring anyone happiness.
 No one…
 Neither you…
 nor I.
 As I expected…
 I’m different from you guys…
 I’m walking a road that’s incompatiblewith the rest of you.
 The four of us worked together…
 and it’s true that there was a timewhen I thought that was my road.
 The four of us have worked together,
 but in the end,I decided on revenge.
 That’s been my reason for living.
 I can’t become likeyou and Naruto.
 Are you going to isolateyourself again, Sasuke?!
 You taught me that solitudeis a very rough thing that time, Sasuke!
 Now I know exactly how that feels.
 I have both family and friends…
 But if you were no longer here, Sasuke…
 for me…
 for me it would be the same as solitude.
 From here again…
 we’re going to start walkingour new paths individually.
 I…!
 I love you so very, very much, Sasuke!
 If you would only be with me, Sasuke,
 I won't let you regret it,no matter what!
 I’ll make it fun every day andyou will definitely find happiness!
 I’ll do anything for you, Sasuke!
 So…I’m begging you,please stay here!
 I’ll even help you with your revenge!
 I’ll make it happen somehow,I promise you…!
 So stay here…with me…!
 If that doesn’t work for you…
 Then take me with you…
 You really are…annoying.
 Don’t go!
 If you go, I’ll scream and…
 Sakura…
 Thank you…
 Sasuke…
 We were waiting for you, Master Sasuke.
 What’s your intention?
 It was already decided thatyou would be our leader
 the moment you exited the village.
 Please forgive our rudenessup to now.
 I don’t care about any of that.
 Let’s go.
 This is the beginning!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a personbroken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around (round around)
 Shake shake shakeLet’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 What? That jerk Sasuke.
 What the heck is he thinking?He has such a twisted personality!
 What is it that he disliked so muchthat he'd do something like this?!
 Damn! I'm not about to let that guydo whatever he wants!
 If things come to this, I'll chase himdown to the end of the world.
 I'll drag that guy backeven if I have to grab him by his neck!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Die.
 Darn!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hmm... Shadow Clone Jutsu.And there are quite a few of them.
 Here I go!
 It's impossible, after all...
 There is no way thatyou can beat a guy!
 There is only one way leftto defeat this guy.
 Sasuke!
 I see!
 So that's your plan, Naruto!
 That's pretty good for you!
 Demon Wind Shuriken,
 Windmill of Shadows...
 A Shuriken won't work on me.
 I see.
 This time it's aiming for my real body…
 But...
 It's not so easy!
 A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow!
 This is...
 The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
 A second Shuriken in his blind spot!
 But...
 Still too naïve.
 He dodged it!
 Here it is!
 Kakashi: Sharingan Warrior!
 You little brat!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Naruto...
 Your strategy was outstanding.
 You've grown up…Both of you.
 The purpose of the Shadow Cloneswas not to take down Zabuza,
 but to hide my transformationinto Demon Wind Shuriken!
 I left one clone behind, thentransformed into Demon Wind Shuriken.
 Then a clone threw the real me, who hadtransformed into Demon Wind Shuriken,
 towards Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 When Sasuke got me,
 he must have realizedright away who I was.
 Then he took out his own Shuriken...
 And that's the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
 Demon Wind Shuriken…
 Windmill of Shadows!
 Hidden in the shadow of the real Shuriken,I aimed for Zabuza.
 Of course I didn't think I would defeat Zabuza!
 But I thought I'd destroythe Water Prison.
 And as a bonusI defeated his water clone, too…
 It was a huge success!
 That was a fluke…
 It was a fluke, huh!
 Still, they performed oustandinglyin tandem…
 in this desperate situation.
 Despite the fact…
 that those two alwaysfight like cats and dogs.
 Hmph…
 I got distracted andbroke my Water Prison Jutsu…
 That's not it!
 You didn't break the Jutsu…
 They forced you to break it.
 I'll tell you now,the same Jutsu won't work on me twice.
 So what will you do?

 He's perfectly…

 What?
 He's reading my mind?!
 Blast him! He's...

 No way!
 I was just about toset forth that Jutsu...
 I can't keep up with…
 his Jutsu!
 It's over…
 Why...?
 Are you able to see into the future…?
 Yeah…
 You're going to die!
 You were right. He died.
 He's definitely dead.
 I thank you.
 I have been waiting for the chanceto kill Zabuza.
 By the looks of that mask...
 You're a Tracker Ninja fromthe Village Hidden in the Mist.
 Impressive. You're very knowledgeable.
 Tracker Ninja?
 You don't know whata Tracker Ninja is?
 We learned it atthe Academy, didn't we?
 Tracker Ninja pursue…
 guys like Zabuza who turn againstthe village where they were born and raised.
 And when they break away fromthe village,
 Tracker Ninja go after these Rogue Ninjaand assassinate them….
 in order to avoid havingthe secrets of the village being leaked.
 That's common knowledge!
 You should study more!
 That's right.
 I'm a member of Hidden Mist Village'sTracking Unit
 whose mission is tohunt Rogue Ninja.
 From his height and voice,he's not all that different from Naruto…
 A Tracker Ninja… ?
 He's not just an ordinary kid…
 What are you?!
 Hey you!
 Don't worry, Naruto.He's not an enemy.
 That's not what I'm asking!
 I…!
 I mean...!
 That Zabuza…That Zabuza was killed!
 That guy who was so strong…
 He was killed so easily... by a kidwho's no different from me!
 We're…
 We're pathetic!
 I can't accept that!
 Well!
 I understand your disbelief.
 But… this, too, is reality.
 In this world, there are kidswho are younger than you…
 and stronger than me.
 Your battle is over for now.
 I must get rid of this corpse…
 because it contains many secrets.
 Now then, please excuse me.
 He's disappeared!
 He's not here anymore.
 What was all this for?!
 What are we anyway?!
 Naruto…
 Darn it! Darn it! Darn it!DARN it!
 Things like this happenwhen you're a Ninja.
 If you're frustrated,apply it next time!
 Our mission hasn't ended yet.
 We must take Mr.Tazuna home.
 So sorry, everyone!
 You can rest at my house!
 Okay!
 Let's perk up and go!
 W-What!
 What happened!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 What'll we do?!
 Kakashi Sensei has collapsed!
 Gato's henchmen are probablygonna come and attack us again!
 Guess it means we've gottafight by ourselves.
 Who knows if this training willmake us stronger but,
 it's getting interesting!
 I'll definitely get stronger.

 Now, Kabuto…
 Get rid of her,but don’t make her suffer.

 So I’m begging you…Please stay here!
 You are really annoying.
 Please don’t go!

 Hmm?
 Did you…say something?
 Wait!
 Where’s Sasuke!Where is Sasuke?
 It couldn’t be that…your body is already Sasuke's…?
 There’s no need to keep ita secret any longer.
 It’s all right, Kabuto,go on and tell her.
 He was a little latein getting here.
 Lord Orochimaru wasn’t able towait for Sasuke,
 and already had been reincarnatedinto another vessel.
 So Sasuke is all right?!Somewhere in this building…
 Lord Orochimaru gave Sasukethe Curse Mark,
 so he could wait forthe next opportunity to reincarnate.
 But…
 Not all humans cantolerate Curse Marks.
 No way, there’s no waythat Sasuke could be…
 That’s right, Sasuke wasn’t ableto tolerate the Curse Mark
 and so he died.
 That's a lie.
 It has to be a lie!
 What would telling a lielike that accomplish?
 To someone that’s going to die…As you are?
 If you want to see him that badlyI’ll let you see him.

 – Yikes! 					– Oww!

 Since you and Orochimaru are here,
 it means Sasuke is probably here too!
 Tell us the truth right now!
 Wh-What the heck?My body won’t move…
 Have a good look at yourself.
 Wh-What’s this?
 Those are Chakra Threads.
 Chakra Threads?
 While you were attacking earlier,
 I wrapped the thread around you.
 Take a good look at wherethat thread is connected.
 That’s right.
 Those Chakra Threads are…
 connected to my heart’sChakra Network.
 And Naruto, the thread that’swrapped around you
 is connected through my Chakra Networkto your organs and to your heart.
 See, can you hear that?
 My heart and your heart willeventually become connected as one!
 – Damn! 					– Naruto!
 It’s no use. That thread is formulatedand spun with Chakra
 and it will absolutely not break.
 Now our hearts arecompletely synchronized…
 The Chakra which passesthrough this thread
 via the Chakra Network from my heartis controlling your heart ,you see.
 It’s no use, even thoughit’s my heart…
 If my heart beat gets faster,your heart will get faster too…
 And when my heart stops beating…
 you will die too!
 Don’t! If you stop your heart,you’ll die too!
 That’s right.But that doesn’t mean much.
 Since I’ve already promisedmy body to Lord Orochimaru…
 Wh-What the heck areyou gonna do?!
 If I crush this heart…
 you will die too!
 If I crush this heart…
 you will die too!
 Now, together we will…
 Naruto!
 How’s it feel to haveyour heart seized?
 It’ll be all right…
 You’ll be out of your miseryright away!
 Stop it!
 How foolish, if you kill meNaruto will die too.
 What I’m gonna cut…
 is this!
 There’s no use you know,
 It’s impossible to cut thread formulatedand made from Chakra.
 Even Lady Tsunade’s great strengthwouldn’t be able to break it.
 What should I…What should I do?!
 Naruto is suffering rightin front of my eyes and yet…
 I can’t do anything!
 Sakura…!
 I…absolutely will not lose!
 Until I’ve fulfilled my promise!
 You bravado ends there.
 Now, shall we die together?
 And go to the place whereSasuke is waiting?
 Naruto!
 Sakura!
 – Sasame?! 					– Sakura…
 Stick this tag on a Kunai Knife!

 Naruto?!Hey, are you okay? Naruto!
 No way…
 It can’t be…
 No way!
 Naruto!
 Ahh… My chest right nowis beating with joy.
 Idiot! It was a waste for meto have worried!
 Sorry, Sakura…
 You’re so worthless!
 That’s right, Sasame!Why are you here?
 Well, it’s…
 I was saved by Sasame,you know.
 Me too.
 What do you mean?
 Water came rushing into thattrap pit we were in earlier…
 That’s it! The lid to the pit!
 Damn!
 When the water reachedthe ceiling,
 I desperately tried to open the lid,but wasn’t able to escape…
 I was told by Master Jiraiyato go to where Hanzaki is.
 But I got concerned about Arashi,so I came…
 Naruto!
 Hey! Thanks!
 Th-The frog spoke…!
 Well, come to think of it,
 there’s no way you could open the lidof the trap by pushing on it.
 Geez!
 But how come the thread thatI couldn’t cut with the Kunai Knife,
 be cut when I wrapped itwith Sasame’s tag?
 Because the Chakra Threadis a Secret Technique
 within the secrets ofour Fuuma Ninja Technique…
 Of the Fuuma?!
 Oh I see…So who the heck is this?!
 Oh!
 She is…from earlier!
 Mistress Kagero…
 She’s a Fuuma Jonin.
 Sasame!
 Sasame…
 I was resurrectedby Lord Orochimaru…
 You! You’re being trickedby Orochimaru!
 Where is Sasuke?
 And Arashi?Where’s Sasame’s cousin!
 Lord Orochimaru is…
 going to raise our Fuuma clan…
 to the center stageof Shinobi again.
 You’re still talking aboutthat stuff?!
 At least tell Sasame the truth!
 So it’s there! He’s in there!
 Sasame and Arashi…You two were so close…
 Then it’d be betterif you didn’t see him.
 Mistress Kagero …
 What do you want to do, Sasame?
 Do you want to wait here?
 I will see him!No matter what’s in store for me!
 I came all the way hereto see Arashi!
 Yeah! You’ve got guts!
 All right! Let’s go together!
 Yeah! Let’s go!
 Sasame…
 There might be some sort of trap…
 Leave it to me!
 Orochimaru?!
 Good of you to come, Sasame…
 Why…?
 Arashi…!
 Arashi!
 Arashi?
 I’m no longer…
 Arashi…
 Wh-What the heck is going on?!
 The skills and bodies of the Fuuma Joninwere combined into one…
 and I’ve been reborn asthe ultimate Ninja you see…
 Now, I’ll show youmy ultimate Ninjutsu…Sasame!
 No… Arashi…
 Damn, Orochimaru!
 I will not forgive him,no matter what!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,and
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Sorry… I’m sorry, Naruto.
 I haven’t been able to do anything,after all.
 I’m always dragging you down.I hadn’t changed at all.
 But Naruto, Sasame,you two taught me.
 That’s why I want to changethe kind of person I am!
 This time, this time,it’s my turn to give it my all!
 Next time, “Sakura's Determination!”

13,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Inari! Give me a hand.21	02:16:45:14	02:16:46:22I'll be right there.
 This mist…
 Sasuke! Sakura! They're coming!
 I knew he was still alive.
 Making an appearance so soon, eh…
 Say, Kakashi Sensei.
 This is his…Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.
 I see you've got those bratswith you as always.
 He's still trembling. Poor thing.
 I'm trembling with…excitement.
 Do it, Sasuke.
 I can see him!
 Well, well.
 So you discernedthe Water Doppelganger Jutsu.
 That brat's grown quite a bit.
 This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
 So it seems.
 Damn it!
 I'm totally late!
 Well, well… It seems my predictionwas right on the money.
 Prediction?
 That little mask...
 Oh!
 I knew it… Heh!
 So the Elite Shinobi ofthe Hidden Mist thing
 was a bald-faced lie!
 No matter how you look at him,he's gotta be a comrade of Zabuza.
 Standing together with him and all…
 How dare he show up like thatafter what he did!
 I hate brats who think they're so cool…
 He's better than you, Kakashi Sensei.
 Oh…really?
 I'll do it.
 Huh?
 With his bad acting…I hate brats who think they're so cool!
 Sasuke, you are so cool!
 That Sakura doesn't take stabs at Sasuke…
 He's an impressive youth.
 Hmm...
 Even though those Water Clones
 have only 1/10th the strengthof their original...
 To think he went that well.
 However, you madethe preemptive move.
 Go!
 Right!
 What?!
 Haku's Secret Jutsu:Crystal Ice Mirrors
 Are you Tazuna's daughter?
 Sorry, but you're coming with us.
 Mom!
 Don't come out!Get out of here, quick!
 What's with you, brat?!
 Shall we take him, too?
 One hostage is fine.
 Hostage…?!
 Then...
 Shall we kill him?
 Wait!
 If you lay a hand on that child…
 I'll bite off my tongueand kill myself!
 You want a hostage, right?
 Thank your mom, kid.
 Oh, man… 					lt's not enough…
 Knock it off.You just tried out your sword earlier.
 Forget it already andlet's take the woman.
 Mom, I'm sorry...
 I'm so sorry!
 I'm weak, so I can't protect you…
 I don't want to die…I'm scared!
 You crybaby…
 So you're just gonna cry all daylike the lead in a tragedy?
 An idiot like you can justcry forever! You crybaby!
 He's probably tired of crying.
 So, he knows the true meaning ofthe word strong.
 Like your father.
 For the things I truly holddear to myself…
 I protect them until the endwith both these arms,
 even if it looks like I might lose my life!
 Inari…
 Can I…
 can I also become strong…?
 Dad!
 Looking at that beautiful skinof yours makes me want to cut you.
 Hey…walk faster.
 Wait!
 Inari!
 What? It's just the kid from before.
 Get…get away from my mom!
 Man…This brat's hopeless.
 Let's do it!
 If you do that, I'll bite offmy tongue and--
 Shut up. Go to sleep.
 I…na…ri.
 Well, well…He can see that speed, eh…
 Yes…
 Sakura, surround Tazuna anddon't move away from me.
 Let Sasuke handle him!
 Okay.
 I don't want to have to kill you…
 I'd like for you to back down.
 Nonsense…
 I knew it…
 But you won't be able to keep up with my speed.
 Also, I've already madetwo preemptive moves.
 Two preemptive moves?
 The first one is the scattered water.
 And the second one wasblocking one of your hands…
 Therefore, you'll just be ableto defend my attack…
 What?! With one hand he's…?!
 A one-handed Sign?
 I've never seen such a thing before…
 A Thousand Needles of Death!
 So he doesn't want to kill him…eh.
 I wonder if that's how he really feels…
 Sasuke!
 Remember…that training…
 Build up Chakra at one burst…
 The Substitution Jutsu…?!
 The woman… Hmm?
 Sorry I was late.
 Heroes usually appearon the scene late, so…
 Naruto…!
 Inari, you did well!
 Huh?
 Thanks to you distracting them,I was able to save your mom.
 Naruto…how did you know thatthose samurai were here?
 In the forest, there was a boar thathad been cut-up with a sword.
 Other than that,there were trees with lots of cuts.
 They headed inthe direction of your house…
 so I got worried.
 I see.
 Well…
 If it isn't the no-good Ninjathat Tazuna hired…
 Let's do it…
 Yeah…
 Here they come!
 Hah! Something like that won't work!
 Fools.
 Prepare yourself!
 W-Wow…!
 It's done!
 Naruto, you're just like... a Ninja!
 You fool.I was a Ninja to start with!
 Build up Chakra at one burst…
 to the feet!
 He vanished…
 You're surprisingly stupid…
 From here on…you'll only defend my attack!
 To think Haku wouldlose in speed…
 It seems that I'm faster than you…
 I can't have you mocking our team,calling them brats…
 He may not look it,
 but Sasuke is the number one rookieof the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 And Sakura is our sharpest…
 Hah! Serves you right!
 And the other one isthe number one hyperactive,
 knucklehead Ninja, Naruto Uzumaki.
 You have a cold?
 I'm okay.
 Anyway...Sorry about yesterday, Inari.
 Huh?
 Branding you a crybaby…Forget I ever said that.
 You're strong!
 Dang it!
 I…decided neverto cry again, but…
 Now you'll laugh at me againand call me a crybaby.
 What're you saying…?!
 It's okay…when you're happy.
 It's okay to cry when you're happy!
 Naruto…
 Now then.I can leave the rest to you, right?
 Yeah…
 Okay, I'm going to hop overto the bridge for a bit.
 Man, it's tough being a hero!That's for sure!
 Haku, do you know what this means?
 At this rate, you'll be defeatedby your intended victim…
 Yes…
 What…?
 It's unfortunate…
 Is this…cold air…?
 Hidden Jutsu!
 Crystal Ice Mirrors!
 What is it? What's that Jutsu?
 Are these…mirrors?!
 What…
 in the world…?!
 Damn it!
 I'm your opponent, aren't I?
 Since that Jutsu has appeared…he's done for.
 Now then…I'll start.
 I shall show you...my true speed!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 If you make a move,I'll kill those two!!
 I'm sorry, Tazuna!
 I'm stepping away from here for a bit.
 Sure. Go!
 Sakura!
 Sasuke!
 Take this!
 He caught it?!
 What?!
 Who is it?!
 It's that idiot…that showoff…
 The number one hyperactive,knucklehead Ninja…
 Naruto Uzumaki…
 is finally here!
 Naruto Uzumaki is finally here!
 It'll be okay.
 Now that the hero of the storyhas appeared,
 I'll smash those stupidfunny-looking mirrors in no time…
 Huh? Why won't mirrorsmade of ice break?
 Why won't they melt?
 What the heck is going on here?!

38,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 It’s a custom where balance is preservedby fighting and removing life.
 This is the friendshipof the Shinobi world.
 This is a fight for life with the prideof the village and
 one’s own dream on the line.
 Heh, I’m convinced.
 Anything is fine.
 Just tell us the contentof that fight-for-life test.
 Very well.
 Now then, this is where I’dlike to explain the third exam.
 But actually…
 Please allow me, Hayate Gekko who wasgiven the task of judge, to speak first.
 I leave it to you…
 There’s something... I’d like you allto do...
 before the third exam.
 And that is a preliminaryto the third exam,
 with participation inthe main battle on the line.
 Preliminary?
 What do you mean…preliminary?!
 Sensei, I don’t understandthe point of that preliminary.
 Why aren’t we doing the next examwith the remaining test-takers?
 This time around,
 perhaps because the first andsecond exams were easy,
 there are a few too manypeople left, you see.
 In accordance with the rulesof the Chunin Exams,
 a preliminary will be held in order toreduce the number advancing.
 N-No way!
 As Lord Hokage said before,
 many guests will be coming to the third exam.
 So we can’t have long pointless matchesand our time is limited as well.
 Therefore, those of younot in top physical condition…
 Hey, is he okay…?!
 The teacher doesn’t look well himself?!
 Excuse me.
 Those of you who wish to drop out,please speak up now.
 The preliminary willbegin immediately, so…
 Immediately, you say…?!
 But we finally made it through the second exam.
 This is a pain…
 Huh? What about our meal?
 Narrowing the Field:Sudden Death Elimination!
 Okay!
 I’m going to do my best, no matter what!
 I promised Kabuto, too…
 And oh...
 I forgot to mention this, but it willbe individual battles from now on.
 It is your decision, so feel freeto raise your hands and drop out.
 Who’s going to quit?!
 Sasuke?!
 The waves of pain arecoming faster...
 Sasuke… I knew it.
 Sasuke, you should quitthese preliminaries!
 Huh?!
 L-Look, you haven't been yourself
 ever since you got workedover by that Orochimaru guy!
 That bruise hurts even now, right…?
 Bruise…?
 At this rate…!
 I gave him a parting gift.
 Sasuke will definitely seek me…in search of power.
 You’re the only one left.
 Please…
 Please, quit!
 I’m…scared.
 Sakura…
 I knew it.
 What shall we do?
 We should remove himfrom the exams
 and isolate him withAnbu bodyguards on him.
 We should recommend thathe retire immediately.
 He’s not the kind of type to just obey like that…?!
 After all, he’s of the Uchiha clan.
 What’re you talking nonsense for?!
 I’ll make him stop, by force if needed!
 The Curse Mark responds evenwhen one’s just building up Chakra
 and attempts to forciblyextract his strength!
 It’s a prohibited Jutsu that eatsinto the body of the one who uses a Jutsu!
 It’s a wonder that kid is even enduring it.
 He should really already be dead!
 Lord Hokage!
 You’re in no condition tofight properly, Sasuke…!
 Shut up.
 I understand!
 Be quiet!
 But you’ve been enduring the painthis whole time, right?!
 Please be quiet!
 No matter what you say, Sasuke...
 I’m going to tell the teachersabout the bruise!
 If I do that...
 Well…
 Oh…?!
 What…?
 Excuse me…I’ll quit.
 K-Kabuto…?
 Let's see...
 Kabuto Yakushi ofthe Leaf Village, correct?
 Then, you may step back.
 Okay.
 Kabuto!
 Why’re you quitting?!
 Tell me! Why?!
 This guy…
 I’m sorry, Naruto…
 But my body is worn out.
 Actually before the first exam...
 when I wrangled withthe guys from Sound Village,
 I’ve had no hearing at all in my left ear.
 To fight right away…
 and to be told that my life wouldalso be on the line, I can’t go on.
 I’ve seen that face a few times.
 As I recall, I think he dropped outof the main battle before, as well.
 What in the world is he thinking?
 Anko.
 Uh…yes.
 Kabuto Yakushi.
 According to the data,he has failed six straight times.
 What about his background?
 From his time at the Academy,
 he was a student who didnot really stand out,
 and his grades were ordinary.
 He finally passed the graduation exam on his third try.
 After that, as for the missionshe carried out,
 two C-ranks and fourteen D-ranks.
 It’s not a battle record towrite home about.
 However…
 However…?
 It’s about before the Academy.
 Hmm?
 Do you remember the story...
 about the one boy brought backfrom the Kikyo Pass battle?
 I remember.
 As I recall, I heard an enemy boy survivorat the battlefield
 was taken back by a Jonin fromthe medical unit.
 So he’s that boy…?
 Don’t take arbitrary actions.
 Have you forgottenOrochimaru’s orders?
 I leave it to you guys.
 You in particular, Yoroi.
 There should be no problemshere with your ability.
 This is where you canshow your strength.
 Those of you who are irritated thatI’m ahead of you.
 So you’re Orochimaru’s favorite, huh?
 Don’t get all high and mighty, kid.
 I understand, Yoroi sir.
 Oh.
 Naruto… Sasuke…
 I wanted to play with you guysa little more.
 But if I do more than this…
 The old me might get stirred up.
 I am a spy so far as it goes.
 I cannot expose myself, here.
 Also…if you are going to watch.
 My role of information collectinghas served its purpose…
 Master Orochimaru.
 I’ll save the fun, for some other time…
 Sasuke…
 And Naruto...
 You too.
 Now then, there are no otherswho will quit?
 I must tell the teachers,about Sasuke’s bruise!
 Huh?!
 Be quiet about this bruise.
 Why’re you acting tough like that?!
 I don’t want to watch you sufferall the time anymore!
 For me you are…!
 This has nothing to do with you!
 It’s none of your business.
 I said it once before…
 I’m an avenger.
 This is not just a mere exam to me.
 The Chunin business hasnothing to do with me.
 “Am I strong?”All I want is the answer to that.
 By fighting with those who are strong!
 And…
 I’m Gaara of the desert.
 Hey, you there…ldentify yourself.
 I declare.
 You are absolutely no match for me.
 If I have the opportunity to fight youin the next exam,
 we won’t run or hide.
 And they’re... here!
 I will not allow even youto take my path away from me!
 Sasuke…
 You!
 What’re you doing putting upa front, you idiot?!
 Here Sakura is this worried about you--!
 Naruto!
 I want to fight you, too.
 Huh?!
 What Orochimaru saidis sitting on my mind.
 I will let Sasuke do the test...
 – and see how things go.– Wha--?!
 L-Lord Hokage…!
 However, if the Curse Mark opens
 and the power gets even a little bitout of control,
 get in there and stop it.
 All right.
 But...!
 I understand.
 Now then, we will begin the preliminaries.
 The preliminaries to comewill be one-on-one individual battles.
 In other words,actual battle format.
 There are now exactly twenty people,so we will conduct ten battles.
 The winners will be able toadvance to the third exam.
 There are no rules at all.
 You will fight until someone dies, collapses…or admits defeat.
 And... please admit defeat right away if you don’t want to die.
 However, in case I judgethat a match is over…
 err... I don’t want to needlessly increasedead bodies,
 so I will intervene and stop the matchor something to that effect.
 What holds the key to your destinies is…
 Open it.
 This.
 The names of two foes will berandomly selected and
 displayed on this electronic signboard.
 Now then, let’s get right down to it
 and announce the two namesfor the first battle.
 Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
 To think it’d be so soon…?!
 I couldn’t ask for more.
 No way…!
 Why Sasuke?!
 Now then, the two displayed onthe signboard, come forward.
 For the 1st battle, Yoroi Akado andSasuke Uchiha have been selected.
 No objections, right?
 – Right. 					– No!
 All I can do now is watch…
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke!
 If you want to fight me, don’t lose!
 Sasuke… You’re acting strange…
 Is it because of the Curse Mark…?
 Sasuke, do your best!
 I guess I’ll wait and see…
 The pain won’t go away!
 It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
 Now then, we will begin the first battle.
 Everyone other than the two foes,please move to the upper area.
 Hey! Kakashi Sensei!
 Sasuke!
 Huh?
 Don’t use the Sharingan.
 So you knew?
 If that Curse Mark on your neckgets out of control,
 it could endanger your life.
 I believe it.
 Well, the match will becalled off at that time.
 I’ll be coming in to stop it,so good luck.
 Called off, you say?!
 It seems this Curse Mark thing is responding to my Chakra.
 This is my final Chakra…
 Sharingan!
 Sasuke, stop using the Sharingan!
 If I carelessly build up Chakra,
 it would extract my spirit energy,
 and bring out the Chakrainside my body to no end.
 In other words, in this match,
 I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu,not to mention the Sharingan!
 However... Yoroi’s ability is the worst for you, Sasuke.
 Now then… How will I go…?
 Don’t act rashly…Sasuke.
 Now then, please begin.
 Let’s go!
 Yeah!
 Oh no!
 He did it!
 My strength…?!
 W-What is this?
 My body strength has suddenly…!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke…!
 You…my Chakra…
 You just noticed now…?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Dang it!The pain won't go away!
 This darned Curse Mark isresponding all the time!
 But I won't let thisexam get called off!
 How will I do?How should I fight?
 Am I strong?
 All I want is the answer to that.
 I won't let this thing swallow me upin a place like this!

 D-Dang it…G-Gaara, at any cost…
 What's that?!
 What the heck is going on?
 Who the heck is that youth?
 Who on earth are you?!
 Is it so sudden you can’t tell?
 It’s me. Orochimaru.
 It can’t be… Have you completedthat Forbidden Jutsu?
 I struggled for decades…after leaving the village.
 You’re a truly frightening,inhuman monster!
 So, he did it, huh…?
 The reason I couldn’t select youto be the Fourth Hokage…
 is because of that distortedconsciousness.
 I’ve finally been found out, eh…?
 It’s too bad.
 Orochimaru…What’s the meaning of this?!
 Here I’d set thatmany booby traps…
 so I was quite surprised.
 But I see… So it was you.
 Recently, there has been a steady streamof people going missing from the village,
 from Genin to Chunin,and even Anbu Black Ops members.
 There was also information thatyou had been acting strange…
 Master Orochimaru…
 Why did a Shinobi of your rankdo such a thing?
 Shall I kill you, too?
 Orochimaru! Sure enough,this was your doing…?
 Say it! What were you doing here?!
 Alas! I’ve been found out.
 There’s no point in acting cute…
 It’s for Jutsu development!
 Orochi… You!
 For that purpose, you did thisto fellow Shinobi…?!
 As I thought, Forbidden Jutsu, eh…
 What is it that you want?
 I want everything!
 Everything, you say?!
 Get every Jutsu and understandall of the truths of this world!
 The one who first mixedblue and yellow
 named the new color madein that way, green.
 I just want to do the same thing.
 If blue is Chakra, yellow is a Sign…
 and green is a Jutsu.
 In the same way that thereare no limits to the kinds of colors,
 there are probably also tensof thousands of Jutsu in this world…
 But in order to get anyand all of the Jutsu…
 as well as the truths,a long time is necessary.
 It’s the one who takes thoselong years to know everything,
 who can suitably be calledthe ultimate individual.
 For me, the life span ofthe body is too short.
 Too fleeting.
 Even if I were to be called the Hokage,if I die, it all ends there.
 Orochimaru… Could it be thatthe Jutsu you’re testing here is…
 Right… It sure could be…
 Immortality Jutsu!
 Immortality Jutsu is a technique of
 eternally pooling one’s ownspirits into this earth…
 In other words,it’s a Revival Jutsu where…
 you find a new body, put your own spiritinto that body and take it over.
 I assumed my old form until now,
 so that you would feel nostalgicabout our reunion…
 Aging is an empty thing, isn’t it?
 I feel that keenly when I look at you.
 You’ll die here…
 and I’ll get a younger,more beautiful and stronger body…
 The Leaf truly lets me have my fill of fun…
 I get it…You want Sasuke Uchiha, eh?!
 Right… Exactly… Sasuke.
 A Reviving Jutsu wheresomeone else’s body is stolen
 and the spirit is immortalized, huh?
 How many faces and bodieshave you gone through?!
 Two, I think…
 I plan to take Sasuke over afterraising him a little more to my liking.
 But after all, in order to make you regretyour very own life…
 and curse destiny as you die…
 …perhaps this face is better?
 You monster!
 Lord Hokage!
 Don’t lower your guard, Sensei!You’re always too soft…
 What’s been wrong with you?This isn’t like you!
 I’m sorry…
 Eyes…
 Eyes with malice and ambitionconcealed in them…
 I had noticed thatyou had such tendencies.
 I had noticed,but pretended not to know.
 It was still during the war-torn era.
 A genius who brimmedover strongly with ability…
 Nothing less than a phenomenonthat comes once in several decades.
 So I wanted to think that
 you would carry onmy own will and power.
 That softness on my part…
 created the conditions of that timeas well as now!
 Are you going to…kill me?
 Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!
 I wonder if you can…Sarutobi Sensei!
 Kill him, Sarutobi!Now’s your only chance!
 Sarutobi… You…
 I couldn’t kill him…
 I’ll bury you and correctmy old mistakes, now!
 Here I go!
 It’s too late!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 No way!Why the Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
 To disperse the little Chakrahe has left…!
 You’ve gotten old, after all…
 To think you’d shorten yourown life span out of impatience…
 D-Don’t tell me, you…?!
 Mi, I, Hitsuji, U, Inu, Ne, Tori, Uma, Mi…
 This order of Signs…
 I knew it, Sarutobi,you are using that Jutsu!
 So this is the Grim Reaperthe Fourth Hokage was talking about,
 which only the one who has signeda contract with this Jutsu can see, eh?!
 Whatever you do now, it’s too late…I’ve won.
 The Leaf Village will crumble!
 The Village Hidden in the Leavesis the home where I live.
 The Hokage exists as the pillarto protect that home!
 The Hokage is the one who inheritsand is entrusted the will of the Leaf.
 I won’t go easily!
 Genjutsu! Infinite Darkness Jutsu!
 Stupid nonsense…
 You’re merely a temporal head
 in the history of the organizationcalled the Leaf Village…
 Even the face rock that is leftwill eventually weather and decay.
 Humph… Leaf Village isnot just an organization to me!
 In the Leaf Village,
 every year many Shinobiare born and raised…
 and live and fight…and die to protect the village.
 The people of this village…
 even if they don’t have blood ties…
 To me, they are precious…
 precious…
 family!
 Then I shall smash you, the pillar,and destroy the Leaf home.
 Humph! Even if you kill me,that pillar will not break!
 I am the man who carried on the Leaf Willof the First and Second Hokages…
 The Third Hokage!
 No matter how much you targetthis Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 A new Hokage will carry on my will,shall become a pillar and defend the Leaf!
 Right, Fourth Hokage?
 Orochimaru! Now I will performan ace Jutsu that even you don’t know!
 Behold! Sealing Jutsu!Reaper Death Seal!
 Everyone makes mistakeslt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump

15,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Darn it!
 Where'd he attack from?!ls it the clones?
 Where's the real body?!
 It's useless for you to even attemptfollowing with your eyes.
 I absolutely will not be caught.
 Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Don't!
 This is a teleportation Jutsu that
 uses mirrors that canreflect only my image.
 Watching you from the speed I move,
 it almost seems as ifyou aren't moving at all…
 I knew it!
 Is that Jutsu…the Kekkei Genkai?!
 Kekkei…Genkai…?
 It's the same type asmy Sharingan…
 Then…!
 That's right…
 It's impossible even for meto copy that Jutsu…
 And there's no way to destroythat Jutsu, either!
 Darn it…
 So… What?!
 I can't die here yet.
 'Cause I have a dreamthat I must turn into reality…
 The dream to have my strengthrecognized by everyone in the village…
 and become the Hokage!
 Dream…
 I, for the sake of my dream.And you, for the sake of your dream.
 Please don't hold it against me.
 I want to protect someonespecial to me…
 I work for the sake of that person,I fight for that person,
 and I want to make thatperson's dream a reality…
 That's my dream.
 For the sake of that dreamI will completely become a Shinobi,
 and kill you guys!
 Zero Visibility:The Sharingan Shatters
 Sasuke! Naruto!Don't lose to a guy like that!
 Stop it, Sakura. Don't goad him!
 What?
 Even if there was a chance thatwe could break that technique,
 they won't be able to defeat that boy.
 W-What do you mean?
 They don't have the mentalityto kill their feelings…
 and kill another person!
 That boy really knowsthe agony of being a Shinobi.
 He's different from Naruto and Sasuke.
 Exactly…
 No real Shinobi will come out ofa peace-addicted village like yours.
 Because they are not ableto learn
 the most important ""experience of killing""!
 Then…
 Then…
 What are we going to do, Sensei?!
 If I go over toNaruto and Sasuke,
 Tazuna will be in danger.
 Even if I try the Shadow Clones.
 He'll come to stop me withhis Water Clones.
 I'll just be wasting Chakra.
 Then...
 I'm sorry but...
 I'm going to have to finishthis in an instant.
 Sharingan?!
 The Sharingan again?
 Such an unimaginative guy!
 Sensei!
 You might call me ""an unimaginative guy,""
 but you are afraid of the Sharingan,after all... Zabuza!
 The secret technique of a Shinobi…
 isn't something that you showyour opponent so many times.
 Be appreciative.
 You're the only who has hadthe chance to see it twice…
 And there will be no third time…
 Even if you were able to defeat me,you can't defeat Haku…
 What…?
 Kakashi Sensei can't win?
 That boy in the mask is that strong?
 Since he was a kid, I have beenpainstakingly teaching him
 the battle techniques of the Ninja!
 All of my techniques.
 On top of that…
 he has been polishing uphis own skills as well!
 As a result...
 He has...
 no matter how unbelievably difficulthis predicament,
 been extremely successful.
 He has no ""heart"" and hasabandoned the notion of ""life.""
 He is a fighting machineknown as a Shinobi.
 Not only that,his Jutsu surpasses mine!
 The terrifying ability ofthe Kekkei Genkai.
 In other words,I have acquired a sophisticated tool.
 Unlike the scrap you'recarrying around.
 I'm not one to be afraid justbecause I failed once!
 I'll do it as many times as it takes!
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Stop!
 W-What the hell is it…?!
 I-It was just slight but…
 I could see the trails of his movements…
 One more try!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Don't you understand that it's useless?
 Just because I see the trail,
 doesn't mean that I can keep upwith his speed.
 The water…is being repelled.
 But, what if that wasn't water…?
 All right…
 The next one is goingto be my one shot!
 Just because a bunch of scrapgot together
 doesn't mean thatthey can defeat Haku.
 He is….He is the best tool!
 There's nothing boring thana stranger bragging…
 It's about time…I make my move.
 Now wait.As long as we're talking…
 Let me brag about another thing…
 Hmm?
 In the battle before,
 I didn't just let you defeat melike a fool.
 It's over…
 Haku, who was hiding in the corner,
 was observing part of the battle.
 Haku is quite smart.
 With his ability to analyze,
 he is able to plan a counterattackafter observing a technique just once.
 I've been anxious to copy your line.
 ""I'll tell you now, but the same Jutsuwon't work on me twice.""
 Was that it…?
 Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
 Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
 This is...?!
 What is this…?This really thick fog?
 The visibility is close to zero...
 Sensei…!
 Sakura! Stay with Tazuna!
 That's right.
 I have to trust Sasuke,Naruto and Kakashi Sensei right now…
 And I should do what I can do!
 Huh?
 Oh! Sakura!
 Mr. Tazuna, no matter what, don't move away from me!
 Yeah… I soo know it!
 I know… 					Zabuza…
 I'll finish them off soon enough…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You just don't learn, do you?!
 What? The Fire Style Jutsu!
 It takes…too long!
 This is good!
 Bit by bit, I'm figuring outthe timing...
 I know it's called Hidden Mist,but the fog is way too thick…
 Even Zabuza himself shouldn'tbe able to see anything...
 Good job on dodging it…
 Just what I expect of Kakashiof the Sharingan...
 He's….
 closing his eyes!
 But…the next time you see me,
 that'll be the end of it all…
 You overrate the Sharingan too much.
 What…?
 You spoke as if you saw througheverything, but…
 Why?
 Could it be possible thatyou can see the future…?!
 You are going to die.
 Your foresight was wrong, after all.
 Kakashi...
 You can't read my mind ormy future...
 The Sharingan is merely a diversionthat makes you believe that!
 Those who have the Sharingan...
 possess bothperceptive eyes and hypnotic eyes…
 Using these two powers andbringing out Jutsus one after the other..
 you were just acting as ifyou can read the future!
 First with the perceptive eyes,you copied my movement right away.
 And this is the ImageReplication Method.
 You first got me ina ruffle with it…
 Once you make sure thatI'm flustered,
 you nail the ""heart's voice.""
 – This is the Mind Imitation Method.– It's only an imitation, after all.
 – You can't defeat me! You monkey!– You can't defeat me! You monkey!
 That imitating monkey mouth...
 I'll make sure that you won't beable to open it any more!
 And…
 You judged the right timing whenmy frustration was reaching its height
 W-What is that?
 You set a clever trap.
 Me...?
 You used the Genjutsu withyour hypnotic eye and
 made me weave the signs first...
 This is the Jutsu Imitation Method...
 The Giant Vortex Jutsu!
 R-Ridiculous!
 Then that makes it easier.
 First vanish into the thick fog,
 and make yourperceptive eyes useless….
 Huh?
 Darn! The guard is falling behind!
 I will close my eyes as well!
 I will shut off your ability to useyour hypnotic eye
 in a close-distance battle.
 Why?
 That also means thatyou will lose your ability to see.
 Did you forget...?
 That I am a genius in Silent Killing,
 a technique to findthe target just by sound.
 He read my movement...No way could he do that.
 Darn! We were so close!
 Naruto, can you still move?
 Of course! I'm totally fine!
 He's pretty much spent…and it's no wonder.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu usesa lot of Chakra.
 But thanks to him,I found our way out.
 I found the way to break through!
 Hah!  Impossible!
 That was just a coincidence.
 Naruto! Run!
 What?
 Run out of here andattack from the outside!
 A-All right!
 You won't be able to...!
 I-I'm not going to lose!
 There!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Darn!
 T-That was good just now!
 What?
 We're doing it one more time!
 All right!
 It's likely that there's a limitto that guy's Chakra, too!
 To prove that,he's little by little…
 This won't go as you've planned.
 First, I'll get you!
 Sasuke!
 Darn! It's been a while sinceI've fought in such bad conditions.
 And I'm worried aboutSasuke and Naruto, too...
 Be calm… Think...What will he come after?
 Oh no!
 What?!
 Too late!
 Why? Why is it?
 Why did this happen?
 I never asked for your help!I hated you!
 But you…
 Darn! I won't forgive you!

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough

 Hey boys, you’re the only ones

 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,

 I feel a little thrown off balance.
 Let’s regroup, everybody!
 Go!
 I’m itchy, Elder Brother.
 Yeah, itchy…
 Huh?!
 My punches aren’t havingany effect whatsoever.
 Naruto…
 This doesn’t look good.
 Again!
 Huh?
 I-It itches, Elder Brother.
 Yeah…feels like I’m getting a rash.
 D-Damn!
 I’m not done yet!
 Stop it, Naruto!
 It’s futile…
 – You won't swagger like that for long!– You won't swagger like that for long!
 This feels so good!
 What’s up with those guys anyway?
 You’re an idiot brat as always.
 You have it hard, don’t you?
 Having to go on a missionwith that failure of a brat.
 Don’t you, Iruka?
 Why, Mizuki?!
 I’m asking you, please stopthis kind of foolishness!
 Are you intending to betrayyour comrades from the village again?
 Comrades?
 That's right!Your comrades from the Leaf Village
 with whom you sharedboth pleasures and pain!
 You can understand that,can’t you?
 Comrades…huh?
 As usual, you are naïve,aren’t you…lruka?
 What I believe in is power!
 Don’t think you can shackle me withsuch vague bonds like that of comrades!
 Mizuki…
 I will soon get my handson the ultimate power!
 Lord Orochimaru’s power!
 Orochimaru?!
 Then I’ll teach you a lesson!
 About how meaningless it is…
 that thing you and the other Leaf guysdescribe as camaraderie or whatever!
 Mizuki…
 You were an excellent Shinobi despitehaving committed that crime, you…
 Don’t talk so knowingly!
 Damn! They’re dodging all my attacks!
 Iruka, if you insist so much,why don't you show me?
 What degree of feelingyou really have for your comrades…
 I wonder whether you’ll reallybe able to stop me?
 Come!
 Wait!
 Naruto! Forget about these guys!Pursue Mizuki!
 Damn…!
 I’m gonna settle this laterwithout fail!
 Elder Brother, that guy went off.
 They all went off, didn’t they?
 Elder Brother, could this bea game of hide-and-go-seek?
 Hide-and-go-seek! Hide-and-go-seek!
 So does that mean we’re “It”?
 Those jerks!
 Making us “It” without even decidingby scissors-paper-rock!
 – Let's go, Raijin! 					– Okay!
 A New Squad!                           Two People and a Dog?!
 Over here…lruka.
 Hurry, Naruto!
 Don't be fooled this time!
 Shut up! It’s 100 years too soonto be arguing with me!
 I’m telling you,
 if you dilly-dally the situation’s gonnaget really troublesome again!
 What?!
 Found you!
 Good job, huh, Elder Brother!
 Yeah!
 I don’t have time to bedealing with these guys!
 Elder Brother, hide-and-go-seek is fun,but aren’t you getting hungry?
 You’re really something,aren’t you, Raijin?
 Leave some for your Elder Brother!
 Of course, I will!
 Hey, you idiot brothers!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 This is no time to be eating!
 I’m telling you, it’s foolhardyto be fighting these guys!
 I already know that!
 Mizuki! Where are you?!
 What’s the matter…lruka?
 Weren’t you gonna stop me?
 Stop this foolishness, Mizuki!
 Come on out, Mizuki!
 Always be aware ofan attack from behind…
 For a Shinobi,isn’t that a basic rule?
 Nicely done, Iruka.
 Pretty good!
 Always read behind the surfaceof your enemy’s bluffs…
 For a Shinobi isn’t that a basic rule?
 That’s my line!
 What’s that?
 A Smoke Bomb?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – Come on over! Catch us if you can!– Come on over! Catch us if you can!
 Elder Brother, they’re increasing!They’re increasing!
 Raijin, this must besuper hide-and-go-seek, don’t you think?
 Yeah. That’s right!
 A decoy strategy, huh?You thought it through.
 We can buy some time this way.
 All right, now's our chance…
 – Super, super hide-and-go-seek!– Super, super hide-and-go-seek!
 There are,there are two Old Lady Tsunades!
 You’re talking aboutthe idiotic strength, huh?
 Haven’t you come toyour senses yet?!
 Shut up!
 Why are you so obsessed with power!
 Because that, if anything,is everything!
 Reconsider, Mizuki!lt isn’t too late yet!
 You are naive!
 Don’t you understand the situation?!
 What’s the matter?Come on and attack, Iruka!
 You’re not my enemy!
 You’re my comrade fromthe same village!
 I told you, I’m tired of that kind ofsong and dance!
 And moreover…you’re my colleagu!
 You’re a member of the same familythat inherited the same Will of Fire!
 Will of Fire, huh?
 Yes, that’s right.
 Therefore, please stopthe foolishness, Mizuki!
 It irks me most whenyou say things like that!
 Mizuki!
 Since we’re old acquaintancesI was gonna kill you quickly.
 But now I’ve decided against that.
 You’re gonna have some fun…
 I’ll give you a taste of how it feels
 to be killed slowly byyour so-called comrade!
 Hey, Naruto… How long are youplanning to be like that?
 It’s just a matter of time tillthose guys find you!
 I found you!
 What?! They found us!
 All right! This is it!
 Hide-and-go-seek!
 Hide-and-go-seek!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Elder Brother,super hide-and-go-seek again?
 I’m getting bored with this.
 Shadow Clone again?!
 As always,you have no new tricks, huh!
 Just leave it to me!
 All right! Go!
 – Okay! 					– Go!
 Wh-What?!
 What kind of game is this?
 Wow, they're going so fast.
 I see… Not bad.
 I-I feel sick… Elder Brother.
 I’m woozy…
 Now! Catch them!
 Huh?!
 You jerks…
 What do you think you’re doing?
 The preparation’s done!
 Here it goes!You fatso Herculean brothers!
 Concentrate… I must concentrate…
 Stop putting on airs!
 A guy like you,who’s weaker than me!
 Yeah! That’s right, isn’t it?!
 You always excelled overanything I did, didn’t you…?
 I was always being helped by you,wasn’t I?
 One year has passed already, hasn’t it?
 It’s not so easy to laugh,hiding your sadness.
 Your teacher told me thatyou are the center of the laughter.
 I’m not sad at all!
 It’s an honor for Shinobito die during their missions!
 My dad and mom…
 are heroes who protected this villagefrom the Demon Fox!
 And I am the child of those heroes.
 That’s why I’m not sadeven though I’m alone…
 These tears are from the happiness...
 Enough already.
 I’m always aware thatyou are feeling lonely.
 But you are not alone.
 All of Leaf’s Shinobihave the “Will of Fire.”
 “Will of Fire”?
 It means the will to protect the Leaf.
 As long as you havethe Will of Fire,
 you and people in this villageare all family.
 Iruka, I wonder if you have that.
 Yeah.
 Huh…?
 Who’s that over there?
 Mizuki…
 What are you doing there?
 Well, I heard that Irukawas depressed these days…
 I was worried and came to look for him.
 Everybody’s…worried about you, Iruka.
 Everybody’s waiting over there.Come on and play with us!
 It’s all right… Go on.
 The Mizuki that I idolized was kind…
 And he was a guy who was morethoughtful of his friends than anyone else.
 Yet…
 Please remember! Mizuki!
 You really are…
 an idiot, aren’t you?!
 L-Let go…
 Here it goes…
 S-Stop please!
 I-I feel sick…
 – Huh? 					– Eh?
 What?
 Elder Brother, don’t tell me that you…
 Sorry, Raijin… I squashed…
 our lunch!
 What?!
 Stay still, guys!
 Now take this…!
 – Give us back our lunch!– Give us back our lunch!
 What?!
 H-He’s done it, huh…
 It doesn’t look like you understand me,so let me explain.
 The real reason I was kind to you…
 Because it made me happymore than anything
 to see you in your misery!
 Hey, Iruka!
 We’re gonna go play soccer right now.
 Come join us, Iruka!
 Sure! Okay!
 I wonder if Iruka’s okay
 after all those thingsthat happened to him…
 That’s why we need totry to cheer him up!
 Why…only him…
 Everybody makes a fuss about him
 just because of his parentsgetting killed by Nine-Tail…
 Serves you right…
 Even Lord Hokage?!
 Why…why is it?!
 Who is it over there?
 All right…
 I’m gonna try to gain the favorof Lord Hokage too…
 What are you doing over there?
 Well, I heard that Iruka has beendepressed recently so…
 You’re lying!
 Treating a guy who’s weakerthan oneself with disdain
 is the most pleasurablefeeling of all, Iruka.
 You weren’t that way in the past!
 That’s why I’ve been telling you…you’re naïve!
 That kind of naiveté leads to fatal mistakeson the battleground.
 On the battleground, it’s all abouthow many enemies you can kill!
 If you throw a Kunai blindlyin a bamboo grove,
 all that will happen is that it’ll bounce offand its path will be errant.
 If you’re gonna take aim…make it straight!
 Don’t think I’m gonna get fooled twicewith the same bait!
 Damn… I’m at a disadvantage ifwe fight in a place like this!
 Mizuki…
 You…
 Mizuki!
 I told you, it’s useless…
 If the path is going to be errant,
 then one just needs to calculatethe path of the Kunai when throwing it!
 So you’ve finally gotten serious, huh?
 Follow me!
 Where is this?
 Looks like you’re finally conscious.
 You jerk…
 You ruined our meal…
 Don’t even thinkwe’re gonna let you leave here alive!
 I’m going for his stomach!
 I’m going for his head!
 – One, two… 					– One, two…
 – Three! 					– Three!
 Huh?
 Huh?!
 Wh-What is going on?
 Gimme a break,what are you doing?!
 Wh-Who’s that?
 It’s too much of a dragto tell you my name, however…!
 The most powerful support squadassigned to this mission!
 The most powerful trio fromthe Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 We’re Ino-Shika-Cho!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What's with these guys?!They have super ridiculous strength!
 To think they can resist
 Shadow Possession Jutsuto this extent on sheer power!
 If Shikamaru's Jutsu gets broken now,we'll be in a hairy spot!
 Our only choice is tosettle this right away.
 Are you guys ready?
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,

 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.

 ""The Special Presentation Today!""
 ""The Top 5 FamousSweat and Tears Ninja Battles!
 ""There Are Also Fun Extras""has finally started!
 Isn't this exciting, Sakura?!
 Yes, from the next episode,
 “Naruto” which you’ve allbeen supporting
 for the past four yearswill enter its fifth year.
 And so today,we’re changing our plans
 to present you withfamous battle scenes
 in the order determined byvotes from the guys in the Leaf!
 Is that favorite battle you wantto see again included?
 We’ve also invitedsome special guests,
 so don’t miss it!
 Then, we’ll be moving on ahead.
 First, check out fifth andfourth place back to back!
 FIFTH PLACENARUTO VS. SASUKE		~LEAF HOSPITAL ROOF~
 All right, here we go,here we go, here we go!
 Just what you’d expect of me,the hero!
 To think I’d appear right at the start.
 I’ve shrewdly got everyone’s hearts!
 You’re right!
 To be honest,
 the coolness of Sasuke in motionis unfathomable.
 Outstanding destructive power.Cha!
 Umm, Sakura?
 Our comments aren’t meshingright off the bat.
 Just keep quiet!
 Right.
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Attack and defense withno time to breathe.
 This is gripping.
 Throw in a kick there!
 Give him a beat down and thrash up!
 Umm, Sakura. How abouta little support for the hero there…?
 Shut up, Naruto!
 Naruto Barrage!
 Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!
 Wh-What’s that Jutsu?!
 You jerk!
 Chidori!
 Stop it…you two…
 Stop it!
 That’s mean to punch me allof a sudden, Sakura!
 I couldn’t help it.I got excited.
 FOURTH PLACECHOJI VS. JIROBO		~FATSO VS. FATSO~		Now, let’s collect ourselves		and check out fourth place next!
 It’s too late whatever you do now!
 Crushing Palm!
 Man, this battle moves me to tears,no matter how often I watch it.
 That’s right! As it happens,
 I sat down on my knees in front ofthe TV while blowing my nose.
 It invoked tears in the living roomsin the Land of Fire for sure.
 Yeah, yeah… I really thoughtChoji had died in this episode.
 That’s for sure.
 I was also totally fooledby the producers.
 Wh-What’s that…?
 But…
 Boulder Blow!
 It’s futile!
 I’m a hundred times strongerthan before!
 They say a grudge over foodis ferocious, right?
 That one punch just now
 was the grudge for you eatingthe last bite of the snack.
 No way! He’s got so much Chakrahis build has changed!
 And this is…
 This is for insulting me by calling mea sacrificial piece and fat!
 But what’s most unforgivable isyou insulting my best friend!
 That’s more unforgivable thanswiping the last bite of gourmet food
 or insulting me by calling me fat!
 All my Chakra…to my left hand!
 O-Oh, no…!
 This one punch is heavier than life!
 W-Wait…! 					Don’t be hasty…!
 But seeing it again,visually it’s just fatso versus fatso.
 No appealing parts at alland the screen is stifling.
 I mean, no way would I wantto see this during the summer
 Excuse me for being stifling.
 Yikes! Choji.
 How long were you there…?
 I heard my famous battle made itinto the top five, you see…
 Oh wait, Choji.
 – You’ll understand once I tell you!– Calm down!
 Human Boulder!97.01	01:57:15:03	01:57:16:07	I won!
 I actually…won!
 We had a bit of an incident here,
 but let’s not worry about thatand move on.
 Now before we presentthird to first place,
 we’ll show the famous battlesleft out of the top five.
 Is the famous battleyou chose included?
 Now then, here we go!
 EXTRA SEGMENTUNRANKED FAMOUS BATTLES
 KAKASHI VS. ZABUSA~THE LAND OF WAVES ARC~
 – Rooster! 					– Rooster!
 – Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!– Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!
 Sure enough, Kakashi Sensei’sSharingan is super unfair!
 Just what you’d expect from a Jonin.
 KAKASHI VS. GAI~ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS~
 – What?! 					– You’re late!
 – This is a famous battle?!– You’re seventeen minutes
 – Well, it’s cool to have stuff like this– and thirty two seconds late!
 – included once in a while, right?– Let’s forget about today…
 We both have forty eight wins!
 One of us will move aheadwith this battle!
 It seems it won’t workeven if I say no…
 This time it’s my turn to determinethe battle category…
 What will it be?A Taijutsu fight?
 A 100-meter dash?
 Skin diving? I wouldn’t mindan eating contest…
 Listen, you…
 Well then…
 Wh-What?!
 Rock-paper-scissors!
 I accept the challenge.No way will I lose!
 If I lose, I’ll do five hundred laps
 around the Leaf Villagestanding on my head!
 Absurdity again…
 It’s a promise!
 Here we go again…His favorite own rules.
 Okay, everyone together now.
 – Rock-paper… 					– Rock-paper…
 Scissors!
 After the commercial,we’ll present third to first place.
 Don’t miss it.
 Now at last for the presentationof third to first place.
 First up is third place!
 Now then, which battle has workedits way up to the higher ranks?
 Here we go! The appearance ofthe famous team of Kiba and Akamaru!
 – Heh! 					– Damn it…
 – It’s the appearance of– Is it all over…?
 a team that’s just loud.
 What?!You’re saying to do that?!
 No, Akamaru!
 It’s too dangerous to do thatwithout any comrades around!
 You understand that, don’t you?!
 We’ll die like dogs here if we miss…
 Ow!
 Akamaru…
 To think I’d get bitten by you.I’m a pathetic owner…
 Okay, Akamaru…As you say, we just have to do that…
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Now, Akamaru!
 What?!
 Show him the fruits of our training!
 Dynamic Marking!
 That’s a dirty trick!
 Now we’re ready!
 Inuzuka Style! Man-BeastTransformation Combo!
 Two-Headed Wolf!
 Eat this!
 Sakon, what’re you doing! To the right!
 Uh oh…!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Though he sometimes biteshis owner’s hand,
 he presses for a decision.
 It seems Akamaru’s stock shot upin the Leaf after this.
 What a man!
 Man, my butt! Just a puppywhose evil eyes got worse!
 Who has evil eyes?!
 Yikes, Kiba!
 H-How long were you there…?
 Knock it off!
 Here I was invited as a guest
 with my battlehaving been ranked high.
 What’s the deal offinishing in third place
 on top of being told mean things?!
 It’s Kiba and Akamaruwho finished in third.
 Please face the camera
 and say a few words to everyonein their living rooms.
 Oh, umm, thanks for your support.
 Well, we came in third this time.
 But we’ll kick the butts of some enemies,
 so please look forwardto our success!
 Considering you’re talkingall big or whatever,
 didn’t you have a rough timewith it after this?
 The best is yet to come,I tell you!
 That’s the last straw.Get him, Akamaru!
 Now for the presentationof second place.
 He’s like a completely different person…
 His Chakra activity is overwhelming…
 And those markings…
 The movements earlier…
 He dodged the attack from behind
 and saw me hiding in the shadows…
 In other words, he’s combiningwide vision and x-ray vision.
 And in addition, that Jutsu…
 Then…
 Summoning Jutsu!
 I’ll find a perfect…way to attack that power of yours.
 If he defends physical attackswith rotation
 and a large emission of Chakra…
 then I should stop that Chakra rotation!
 – This is the second place battle?– Scatter!
 That’s right! It’s a battle of brains whileassessing the opponent’s weak point!
 Hmm. But as for me…
 I’m not a big fan of sluggish battles!
 – Oh, why? 					– Hmm.
 How can I put it?lf you’re talking about battle
 I want to see a collision of fiston fist, and body on body.
 Oh, but a Ninja isn’t justabout Taijutsu.
 Oh. That’s being rude to Bushy Brow.
 Oh, sorry.
 I mean, yeah, I want to see
 something fiery, like Bushy Brow!
 There just isn’t anything fieryin Neji’s battles.
 Here!
 He’s argumentative or something.
 Unexciting or something.
 I’d like him to just take on the enemywithout regard to appearances!
 Heh! Missions with you area chore because you think like that.
 Yikes, Neji!
 Now then, a few words fromthe second place Neji.
 Humph! How silly.
 You’re free to evaluate my battles,but it’s unthinkable
 for me to be forced to appearin a place like this.
 Heh! You’re sure makingan exhibition of yourself, considering!
 Oh! Could it be you’re afteran appearance fee?!
 Too bad.
 This is a program for everyonein their living rooms,
 so we asked you to do this for free!
 No problem.I asked the Fifth Hokage
 and she’s treating this appearanceas a mission.
 Since it’s a mission,I have no choice but to appear.
 And of course, a mission feewill be incurred.
 Whoa, always the realist.
 Neji, it’s not fair thatyou get paid for this!
 My brain is built differently than yours!
 Gentle Fist!
 It seems the ranking board is busted,
 so we’ll go right on aheadand present first place.
 Which battle has finished in first?
 Chidori!
 Oh ho! Sure enough, it’s pointless
 if the number one battleisn’t one of my battles!
 That’s right!This is the battle that
 anyone wouldacknowledge as number one.
 Rasengan!
 – Rasengan! 					– Chidori!
 And so, did you all guess right?
 The glorious best battle has beendetermined to be “Sasuke’s Battle!”
 Hey, hey, Sakura.lt’s the “Battle in the Final Valley”!
 FIRST PLACENARUTO VS. SASUKE		~FINAL VALLEY~		What? Was it?
 Forget it.
 Well, let’s collect ourselvesand check out
 some special footage of myself,who came in a glorious first place!
 Y-You…idiot!
 Hold it!What’s up with this recording?!
 – This is different from what I prepared!– What’re you doing?!
 – No, no, don’t watch!– Don’t be peeping!
 I demand a do-over as the hero!
 Someone not involved ismaking a ruckus.
 And now, thanks for waiting!
 Now for the appearance ofa special guest.
 Let’s go live to the site.Master Jiraiya!
 What? What?
 Master Jiraiya, can you hear me?
 Yes… Loud and clear.
 What?
 Master Jiraiya,where are you right now?
 Mm, I’m in kind of a dubious place.
 I hope you’ll excuse me fromdivulging my location.
 Well, if I have to say something,
 I’d say I’m in a certain person’shideout, I guess.
 Hey! Pervy Sage!What’re you doing there?!
 What happened to youwatching my training?!
 Now, now.Today’s a special program,
 so don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud.
 More importantly,I’ve met up with someone special…
 None other than Orochimaru.
 What?!
 Sakura…What the hell is this…?!
 It sure has been a long time,Orochimaru!
 Oh, same here…
 Here you could have invited meto the studio.
 Who would invite the likes of you?!
 Well, I have been busy collecting Jutsuand conducting experiments.
 And more importantly,I need him to get stronger quickly, so.
 – If he’s there, bring him out!– What…?!
 Actually, I tried talking him into itmany times saying today’s special…
 But in the end,he didn’t give me a good answer.
 – I see… 					– Hey.
 What?!
 Are you going to goon and on forever?
 If you’ve got that kind of time,then continue the training, Orochimaru.
 S-Sasuke…
 Sasuke…ls that you, Sasuke?!
 I’ll be going on ahead to the dojo.Get a move on.
 Oh, wait…!
 Oh, it seems I’ve angered Sasuke.
 I shall also be leaving now.
 Wait! Orochimaru!Put Sasuke on one more time…
 Sakura…He can’t hear you anymore.
 I know…
 – Sakura… 					– Yeah. Right!
 That’s right!
 Now then,it’s about time to say goodbye.
 Did you all enjoy our special:

 What?
 You know what I’m talking about.
 Kakashi Sensei’s…real face!
 What are you doing?!
 That’s stupid!
 I’m not interested.
 Today’s mission is over,so I’m going home…
 Yeah, I agree…
 Aw geez… It sounds like fun.
 Maybe he has…

 – Great success!– Great success!
 You know what I mean?
 Here! Thanks for waiting!
 All three of you treating me…

 K-Kakashi Sensei, we’re celebratingyour release from the hospital!
 N-Now! P-P-P-lease eat, eat!
 All right…Then I’ll eat it without hesitation.
 Thank you for waiting.
 The pork slices are our treat.
 Thanks for the treat.
 Oh! Sasuke…What a coincidence!
 Get away! Ino Pig!
 Wha--?!
 Aw man! I can’t see at all!
 I’m finished! That was good…
 – So fast! 					– So fast!
 Huh? Something wrong?
 N-Nothing’s wrong.
 Hey!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 – Wow! I'm really curious!– Wow! I'm really curious!
 Now, I will not allow myselfto be denied a glimpse of him!
 But how are yougoing to see it?
 That’s…
 We’ll see it somehow…
 I’m asking you how! You idiot!
 Then, then, do you havea good plan, Sakura?
 That’s…
 We’ll follow by completely marking him.
 If we do that, he’ll eventuallytake his mask off.
 Sasuke, you are really bright.
 What’s that big deal?That was so average!
 Did you say something?
 Well, that's fine.
 What's Kakashi Sensei doing?
 I’m disappointed in him.
 He noticed us!
 Stupid Naruto!We were found because of you!
 I tell you it’s not my fault!
 What?!
 I-It’s being made into a movie?!
 I’m going to go buyan advance ticket.
 Hey, he’s begun to move!
 We’ll follow his track!
 Yeah!
 What? He's gone!
 Darn, he got away…
 Darn it, where did he go…?
 What are you guys doing?
 Do you guys havesome business with me?
 – N-Not really…– N-Not really…
 Hey, how did he find us out?
 Isn’t it because thereare too many of us?
 If the presence is erased,the number of people shouldn’t matter!
 Or…have you forgotten the Jutsu?Sakura…
 That’s you!
 It will be good training to shadow him.
 From now on,we’ll go about it individually.
 Y-Yeah, let’s just leave Naruto here!
 What?!
 And Junko then says…“Oh, I am losing you.”
 What? What?
 He got away…
 Clumsy as usual…
 You idiot…
 Sorry.
 Gosh, what is Kakashi Sensei doing?
 He hasn’t moved forsuch a long time…
 No way!
 Sasuke! How did it go?!
 No more shadowing.
 Off we go!
 Today’s mission is to help at a farm.
 The mission itself is not a big deal.
 We’re definitely going to look at it…
 – Kakashi Sensei’s real face!– Kakashi Sensei’s real face!
 What’s the matter?
 You guys seem to havelots of energy today.
 – I have lots of energy!– I'm ready to go!
 Oh, that’s excellent.
 I’ve finally found you…
 Kakashi Hatake!
 Kakashi…
 It has been a long while,
 but I will settlemy long-standing grudge!
 Boss, what is your grudge?
 Fool! Have you forgotten?!
 I cannot forget.
 It happened in the springof three years ago…
 No!
 You don’t need to be that scared.
 No!
 Our boss says he has somethingto talk to you about…
 Your boss?!
 I love you… Please marry me!
 – Boss is so cool!– Boss is so cool!
 No…
 There’s no need to be embarrassed.
 You can be honest andfly into my arms.
 No…
 Don’t worry.Even though I look like this,
 I have a tidy sum of money!
 I am telling you, no!
 What? You’re turning me downin these surroundings?
 When I say no, I mean no!
 I made it such a romantic setting,but why?
 I don’t like what I don’t like!
 Why don’t you stop it around there?
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Hey, the girl doesn’t like itand no matter how you look at it,
 you’re being rejected, buddy.
 Yeah, yeah.
 You're pretty gutsy.
 Do you understand who we are?!
 Are you challenging us, knowing thatwe are the Moya Ninja Threesome…
 fearsome enough to silencea crying child?!
 Moya Ninja? Never heard of it.
 You don’t know Moya Ninja?!
 How dare you make fools of us!
 Who the hell are you?
 It’s not worth enough to introduce, but…
 Well, my name is Kakashi Hatake.
 – You’re introducing yourself!– You’re introducing yourself!
 Hey you…
 You’re going to regret it.
 For getting in the way ofsomeone's romance!
 Romance?
 Isn’t it just an annoying,one-sided love?
 Enough!
 Men! We’re going to attack!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 4…3…2…1…
 – Hustle! Hustle!– Hustle! Hustle!
 Please! Somebody help me!
 Hey! I can't stand heights!
 I’ll take you back to the village.
 Stop talking! Hey!
 Hey, quit sighing!What, are you just leaving us here?!
 That's how it went…
 – Don’t be so proud!– Don't be so proud!
 – You lost! 					– You lost!
 So it means revenge fromthree years ago!
 Boss has become strongerin the last three years,
 and he’s going to beat him upin a face-to-face match!
 That’s so dramatic!
 Fool! Who would take such risk?!
 Huh?
 If we’re going to do it,
 we’ll do it stealthily fromthe shadows! Stealthily.
 – D-Dirty! 					– D-Dirty!
 Welcome!
 Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!
 Welcome!
 Incredible!
 Looks delicious!
 How extravagant.
 Please take your time…
 Kakashi…
 Now eat, this will beyour last dinner party.
 That meal containsa tasteless and odorless medicine
 that causes uncontrollable hiccups.
 Just keep on havingthe ceaseless hiccups and die suffering!
 It’s a fitting end for you!
 Something wrong?
 Not one of you haseven laid chopsticks on the food.
 Not really, but why don’t you,Kakashi Sensei, hurry up and eat?
 Well, I'm on a diet.
 Figured he'd say something like that.
 Then I’ll strip off that maskif it kills me!
 My hands slipped…
 How could you!
 Oh, sorry, sorry, I unintentionally…
 – What do you mean ""unintentionally""?!– What do you mean ""unintentionally""?!
 What a pity! The meal…
 – How could he do such a thing?!– How could he do such a thing?!
 Hey, what’s the next move?
 Don’t worry. I have an idea.
 – An idea? 					– An idea?
 I see, this is pretty good thinkingfor Sasuke.
 A person would normallytake off the mask here.
 Never mind that.Just be quiet, you idiot!
 Kakashi, you will die here!
 From this needle on the blowpipe arrow,
 coated with medicine I preparedthat will make you laugh uncontrollably…
 You’ll die laughing…
 That is the fitting way for you…
 Darn…
 I wanted to see it too,but this is a hot spring…
 But I want to see!
 Kakashi Sensei!Aren’t you ready yet?
 All right, I’m coming in now.
 I do want to see it!
 Here he comes!
 Great!
 Oh, I can’t see at all!
 Thanks for waiting.I'll just soak for a little while.
 – Why is it like this?!– Why is it like this?!
 Now!
 Huh? Something wrong?
 And slowly, I sink in.
 What the--?!
 What happened?I want to know!
 What in the world isKakashi Sensei thinking? Huh?
 Darn, I’m completely flushed… Huh?
 – Our clothes are gone!– Our clothes are gone!
 Please come again!Please come again!
 Thank you for coming!
 Please come again!Please come again!
 Crap…I’m going todefinitely defeat you, Kakashi Hatake.
 But it was great thatwe brought spare clothes.
 I wonder who took them away…?Our clothes!
 All right,each of you work at your own posts.
 Now, break up.
 I can't stand it anymore…
 I have too much stress stored inside.
 I’m almost at the end ofmy patience as well…
 Sasuke…actually, me too…
 Then, it’s the last resort!
 – Last resort?– Last resort?
 What is this?
 Can’t you see? It’s Shinobi outfit.
 When did you get this ready?
 Well, well, never mind that,never mind that.
 What do you do with this?
 We’ll strip away the mask.Even if we have to use force!
 Darn Kakashi…
 Boss! Look at that!
 Hey, Kakashi Hatake!
 Hey, what are you guys up to?
 W-What are you talking about?We are simply Ninja.
 It is not that we want to seewhat is behind your mask--!
 Fool! Don’t say unnecessary things!
 That’s…!
 Boss! There’s somebody else besides youwho holds a grudge on Kakashi!
 Now is the chance!
 Right! Let’s go!
 – Right! 					– Right!
 Stop right there!
 Kakashi! It’s time for youto pay for your crime!
 You shall die!
 With this medicine I preparedthat will make you cry… What?!
 Oh, just when I thought how longyou guys were going to sneak around…
 you finally come out.
 Ah, well, you know…
 But before that,Sasuke, Sakura, Naruto!
 Why are you guys dressed like that?
 Huh?! Well, yeah, so…
 Oh no…
 We have to make up an explanation,whatever it is!
 Caught you!
 We were well aware thatyou three were targeting Kakashi Sensei!
 What?! Then our plot was exposedfrom the beginning!
 Of course!This was a trap to lure you guys out!
 We caught you off guard!
 So we were completely caughtin the trap.
 Darn! We underestimated you,thinking it was kids!
 I never heard that story!
 Nice, Sakura!
 I don’t quite get what’s happening,but oh well…
 – Please forgive us!– Please forgive us!
 There’s no use talking…
 – O-Oh no! 					– S-Stop!
 It’s the same as three years ago!
 This time, we're hung by just one rope,combined with the same movement.
 By the way, who are you guys?
 – And he doesn’t even remember us!– And he doesn’t even remember us!
 Hey, Kakashi Sensei.
 Yeah?
 What is behind that mask?
 What? You wanted to seewhat’s behind this mask?
 Yeah!
 Then you should have saidthat from the beginning…
 Well, can you show us?
 I don’t mind…
 What the--?!
 Sure thing.
 All right…
 Is it like cod roe?
 Buckteeth?
 Or a tiny mouth?
 Behind this mask…
 – Behind that mask…– Behind that mask…
 There happens to be another mask!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 What--?!
 What in the world is that ?!
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 Begging your pardon!Begging your pardon!

 Sasuke…
 My, my arm!
 Are you okay, Lord Orochimaru?
 Please take this medicine quickly.
 Oh, my…
 Just as I get back,I have to clean the room.
 Please make sure you to takeyour medicine.
 I don't need that kindof lip service.
 It's medicine that I prescribed.
 The pain should subsideat least slightly.
 The pain on this armthat seems to burn…
 I never thought that it causethis much suffering.
 Sarutobi…known as Third Hokage.lt's his last curse, after all.
 Enough of the talking…
 More importantly,has that individual been found?
 Yes… She seems to be at a placecalled Tanzaku Town.
 Tanzaku Town…
 Is that so…?
 But the opponent is one of the Sannin,the Legendary Three Ninjas.
 It won’t be that simple.
 Good medicine tends to taste bitter.
 Here.
 It’s the same one…But this is the trick?
 You’re the type who was yelled atat the academy
 for not having concentration, right?
 That doesn’t have anythingto do with me now.
 Look at this paper.
 Uh?
 I’ve seen it.
 Fine, then.
 Look at it again.
 Hmm?
 So what is this?
 It’s not something thatI need to explain in length,
 but when you first lookedat this blank piece of paper,
 you just glanced atthe whole thing, correct?
 Probably.
 Then where do you look on this one?
 Most likely the point in the middle?
 When a human being looks atjust a blank piece of paper,
 he doesn’t know where to look,so the eyes wander.
 But if you put even a single point on it,
 the mind focuses there…
 This is concentrating at a single pointand as you focus your mind,
 you become spiritually stable andyou are able to extract unexpected power.
 Huh?
 When you opened a holeon the rubber ball,
 you must have beenconcentrating desperately
 to fill up the Chakrain the palm of your hand.
 Yeah, yeah.
 When you concentrate,power emerges.
 But without a target,it is difficult to concentrate.
 That’s why we have this…
 Listen Naruto, from now on,
 when you store up the Chakrayou build in your right hand,
 try to store it up by concentratingon that mark.
 Concentrate…
 All right, I’ll try it!
 Focal Point:The Mark of the Leaf
 Concentrate!
 Darn it. It’s not supposed to be like this.
 It has to break like “pang.”
 Concentrate!
 Hello… I’d like to make a little inquiry.
 Dang it.
 Concentrate.
 Concentrate!
 No good.
 Dang it. What does it meanto concentrate?!
 Damn you, Sarutobi!
 All right then…
 I’m going again to gathersome information.
 What…? But you just came.
 I don’t have any time to waste.
 Hey, hey…!
 Isn’t there going to be evena little soulful game of catch
 between the master and pupil?
 You scoundrel.
 Strike!
 Here,  the game of catch is over.
 See you later.
 Humph… I’ll forget about that Pervy Sageand work hard by myself.
 That’s the only way, Naruto…
 You have to do this training alone.
 You have the ability to approachthe Fourth Hokage’s level…
 Grasp it by yourself!
 Hmm… Never seen her.
 If that’s the case…
 Sorry to bother you.
 I know the person.
 As well as where she is right now.
 I’ll buy you a drink.
 There’s no need.I was able to win a tidy sum…
 Thanks to that lady.
 Yeah…you are indeedthe Legendary Sitting Duck.
 She lost again, huh.
 Her losses started to pile up…
 So she was talking aboutchanging her location.
 Where to?
 One of the Sannin, Lady Tsunade,is staying at Tanzaku Town over there.
 Then this arm can finally…
 Even if it’s good medicine,
 you won’t get away with justa bitter taste with that person.
 It’s fine.
 Seven, seven, seven…
 Seven, seven, seven…
 Seven, seven, seven…
 Here it comes!
 Congratulations to the customer!
 Fever has startedon machine number 44.
 Now, please keep on getting it outlike a flood.
 Lady Tsunade, a rare thing does happenonce in while.
 A 3-7 for me?
 Oh wow, lady.
 Yeah, what a great work.
 Wish I could be favoredby good fortune too.
 – Oh, here it comes again!– Here it comes again!
 Yay…it’s “fever” again!
 A person like me pullsa big hit like this…
 I have a bad premonition.
 I also have some knowledgeregarding Lady Tsunade…
 I did use to be part ofthe Medical Corps, after all.
 She was the first person to proposewhat is now an accepted practice
 of assigning one medical specialistto a small squad of four.
 This was a very revolutionary- idea…
 A small combat unit that doesn’teven have emergency medical skills,
 what would happen to them in a battlefieldis clearer than seeing fire.
 Countless experiences in war
 simply became knowledgeto equip themselves with.
 Many who were sacrificedled to the creation of that style.
 A person understands the natureof things for the first time
 after losing them.
 And the thing created byone of the legendary Sannin,
 who is known as the medical specialist
 is that sacrifice.
 Not working…
 I got to concentrate even more.
 Concentrate, concentrate.
 Concentrate, concentrate.
 Concentrate!
 Concentrate…
 Concentrate on one point.
 Strike!
 Strike!
 That stupid perve’s face floats upin my head
 and I can’t even concentrate.
 Oh boy…
 Some gal somewhere is talkingabout me again.
 Pinball Games
 Wait for me, Lady Tsunade!
 What’s the matter?
 Your winning this much is like a miracle…
 But you don’t look pleased at all.
 This town.
 Huh?
 I get a bad premonition.
 We’re going to hurry up and leave.
 But this is a tourist resort…
 We should take our time andgo see the famous castle and all.
 Then we’re going to hurry upand see it so we can leave.
 But…Lady Tsunade!
 Lord Orochimaru!
 Let’s get this business over with.
 Even if we have to usea slightly rough method.
 I got to do it.
 Ouch!
 Ouch… It hurts so much,I can’t even build up my Chakra…
 He might be reaching his limit soon.
 Just a bit…just a bit more rest.
 Hey!
 You guys, we’re in class right now.
 You…fools!
 You guys have no concentration at all…!
 This is not the way tobecome fine Ninja.
 How can we stay still at a table,right, Akamaru?
 I’m hungry.
 Sensei, if it’s a scolding,do it quickly.
 What the--?! You, you guys…
 From now, we will havean after-school lesson
 to teach you guys more concentration!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 What’s this?
 You guys are going to do from now
 what the predecessors ofthe Leaf Village
 used to perform every dayas a concentration method!
 It is training to build up Chakra
 by concentrating your entire energyon the leaf on your forehead.
 It’s an ancient way of learning
 how not to become distractedfrom anything else
 by concentrating on a single point,the leaf.
 The one who hones his concentration is truly a great Ninja…
 This is the origin of the Leaf Symbolon the headband.
 That sounds like a lie.
 Aren’t you making that story upto force us to try harder?
 I’m not making this up!lt’s a true story.
 Anyhow, can you really becomea great Ninja
 by just polishing your concentration?
 At any rate,a great Ninja is a guy who’s strong.
 Hey, you have a point.
 This stuff…
 Bye, bye Sensei!
 Hey, hey, you guys wait a minute.
 – We won’t wait!– We don't have time for that!
 Hey! You misfits!
 This is the same thing.
 I should have paid more attentionto what Iruka Sensei was saying…
 I’m so stupid.
 But nothing will startif I just keep on regretting.
 All right, I’m going to master this!
 Concentrate, concentrate…
 Concentrate!
 Wow! Tanzaku Castle sure does havea commanding presence!
 It’s worth being designatedas the cultural heritage.
 Don’t dally…
 We’re going to hurry upand leave this town.
 Lady Tsunade, please look more carefully…
 It costs nothing to view.
 Lady Tsunade?
 What is this chill?
 Now!
 What a kid…
 Raising the density in Chakrato the point that it burns the palm.
 He never ceases to amaze me.
 It broke.
 Good! The second step seems to be complete.
 Hurry… The third step.
 That will come later.
 We’ll now go meet Tsunade.
 That’s…
 Orochimaru.
 I found you.
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools
 I can master the third step while walking?Give me a break!
 Fool! If we don't hurry it up,we'll lose Tsunade!
 Besides, she's short-temperedand impatient!
 Where are we heading?
 If she's here in this town, we'll justlook for her from somewhere high up.
 – So we'll climb up a castle.– Castle?!
 – Can't you see over there?!– Which way is ""over there""?

 A Feeling of Yearning,A Flower Full of Hope
 Some of you have probablyalready heard but…
 Gekko Hayate’s corpse wasfound near Kikyo Castle…
 What… Hayate?
 No way…
 That’s ridiculous!
 Is the opponent Orochimaru?
 No…we shouldn’t jump tothat conclusion so easily.
 The one Hayate was followingwas likely a Sound spy called Kabuto…
 Well, it’s certain that Orochimaruis trying to do something but…
 So…we’ll cancel Chunin Examand go after Orochimaru…?!
 No, he revealed his identity to Anko…
 sending us a threat not to cancel.
 Not to cancel the Chunin Exam
 for which all of the Ninja ofthe Alliance have gathered!
 What does it mean?
 Orochimaru possesses enough powerto take down a small Land on his own.
 He’s a Ninja that probablyevery land has eyes on.
 Moreover, he conveniently holdsa grudge
 against this Village Hiddenin the Leaves.
 Any Land would desire him.
 So could it be…
 that any Land in the Alliancewould unite with Orochimaru
 and betray the Village Hiddenin the Leaves?!
 Well, the Alliance Treaty is atthe same level as a verbal agreement!
 As was in the former Great Ninja War…
 In any case,
 there’s too little informationright now.
 Let’s end these unnecessarysuspicions.
 We’ve already dispatched Anbu,
 the black ops to each Landto collect information.
 It’s dangerous to act carelessly…
 That could be what the enemyis aiming for.
 And also…
 I trust all of you!
 When the time comes,
 we’ll bring all the powers of Hidden LeafVillage together and simply fight!
 At that time…
 Be quiet about this bruise!
 Should I have stopped him forcefully…?
 No visitors…?
 That’s correct.I’m sorry but…
 I know he’s been hospitalized,but no visitors…?!
 What’s going on?
 We’re also not aware of the details so…
 There’s no use worrying about it here.
 Huh?
 Should I bring get-well flowers?
 So pretty.
 Oh no!
 Oh… How unusual for you to comeby to buy our flowers.
 N-Not really!Why would you care?
 Besides, isn’t it unusual thatyou’re minding the shop?
 I’ll choose quickly.
 People don’t like flowers withroots when they’re in the hospital
 since they don’t want tobe “rooted” in the hospital…
 So cut flowers are fundamental.
 W-What are you talking about…?
 Playing dumb won’t work.
 You’re going to see Sasuke, right?
 Mom! I’m going out for a bit!
 I-Ino?!
 I won’t let you be the first to visit!I’m going with you!
 A get-well visit!
 Shucks… Ino pig!
 I’m taking this flower…
 One “rose” of love!
 That’s so cliché…
 Then I’ll make mine this.“Narcissus”!
 A noble flower that doesn’tsuccumb to the cold of the winter,
 but hopes for the spring andwaits with dignified presence…
 with the wish for release fromthe hospital as soon as possible.
 You’ve gotten pretty knowledgeable.
 I told you I wouldn’t lose to you!
 Oh, yes yes, so one narcissus, right?
 Uh… I need two.
 Why? One is fine.
 No… One for Lee too.
 More please!
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?
 Ten orders of kalbi!
 You sure can eat.Just watching you makes me feel ill.
 Here you are!
 It’s here!
 This is mine, all right?Don’t eat any of it, Shikamaru!
 I won’t eat any!
 What’s going on with you guys,barbecue in the middle of the day?
 – Oh…? 					– Huh?
 Ino and Sakura…
 Shikamaru, shouldn’t you be going throughsome special training or something
 to prepare for the final exam?
 I am…
 Every single day…
 Asuma is so persistent.
 Actually, Choji’s been joining usin the special training.
 Really?
 So you took it on?
 Yup! In exchange, he’s treating meto as much barbecue as I can eat!
 I see…
 Oh, I shouldn’t have held onfor the Final Round.
 Don’t be ridiculous!
 There are numerous people whowant to participate, but can’t!
 That’s right!
 From what I’ve heard,
 they’re doing some awfullydifficult things
 over at Guy and Kurenai’s team!
 W-What’s that?
 Even though we’ve madeit this far,
 to get totally thrashedwouldn’t be very cool…
 Aw man, what a drag…
 Whatever the circumstances,
 we’ve exceededa human being’s limits.
 So I’ve used too much Chakra…
 Neji, are you all right?!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What?! A tadpole again?!
 You haven’t madeany progress whatsoever!
 See how it’s biggerthan the ones earlier?!
 How the heck should I know?!
 So you want to see Sasuke Uchiha…?
 Just five minutes.
 I can’t allow you to visitany longer than that.
 His body still needs to rest…
 Yes…
 Sasuke. You have visitors…
 Two cute young ladies…
 Oh…!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Sasuke, Sasuke?
 His clothes are gone!
 – What?! 					– What?
 It’s terrible! He’s in no conditionto be walking outside yet!

 Sasuke… Where in the worldhave you gone…?

 Damn, my body is sluggish…
 Will I make it in time…?

 Huh?
 Yo!
 Huh… You finally made it here…
 We’ll search for Sasukeon our end.
 But if you happen to see him,please contact us.
 – We will. 					– Yes.
 And also…you wanted to see Lee, right?
 – Yes. 					– Yes.
 He’s also in no condition to move,so please make your visit brief.

 Why? One is fine.
 No… One for Lee too…
 Speaking of which, Sakura,did you hear about that Lee?
 What? Hear what?
 Well, that Lee…
 his injuries were serious andhe can no longer…
 continue as a Shinobi.

 The rose I went to the troubleof bringing was a waste.

 Oh… How boring.

 Come on, a little longer…Just a little longer!

 You haven’t even done anything.
 You should be thankfulI hung out with you!
 He’s getting ticked off at me.
 All right, I got it… Sexy Jutsu!

 If the training continues like this,I don't mind doing it forever!
 Eat, keeping eating more becausethis will be the last…

 Do you like the food?
 Hey master, one more bowlof ramen please!
 Good. Just keep eating away soyou'll have no regrets about your life.

41,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 …bring it to an end swiftly!
 I won’t let you do anything.
 First move, a surefire victory!
 Wow! That’s amazing!
 What’s with his body?!
 I dislocate every joint
 and with Chakra, I can controlmy softened body at will.
 With Chakra…?
 I can also squeeze untilyour bones break.
 I’ll rapidly tighten as longas you don’t give up.
 I don’t know what kind ofninja tool you’ll use…
 but if I keep doing this to your body,it will make no difference.
 I can break your neck right now.
 So hurry up and give up.
 No.
 Do you want to die?!
 Idiot. You’re the one who’sgoing to die.
 His neck is broken.
 What?
 How ridiculous…
 Phew…
 Idiot.
 I went a little overboard andended up killing you.
 W-What?
 Okay, now it’s my turn.
 T-This is a Puppet!
 T-That’s the real body?
 He’s…a Puppet Master…
 He’s controlling the puppet withChakra from his hand!
 G-Give up…!
 If your bones get crushed,you’ll be able to bend even more, huh?
 For once, I was close to stoppingthe match in the middle.
 The winner, by an inabilityto continue the match by the opponent,
 is Kankuro.
 Two against one is hittingbelow the belt!
 Is that fair, Kakashi Sensei?!
 It’s not particularly hittingbelow the belt.
 It’s a puppet, after all.
 That’s the Puppet Master Jutsu.
 He’s controlling the puppet with Chakra.
 It’s the same as usinga ninja tool-- like shuriken.
 They’re all great Chakra users…
 I thought I could make itkind of far with Chakra.
 Kunoichi Rumble:The Rivals Get Serious!
 Ino…!
 You’ve got the jitters,don’t you, Sakura?
 Wha…?!
 Even Sasuke collapsed.
 I mean, it felt like it was becauseit was Sasuke that it ended at that.
 What’ll happen if you take part?
 It might be best if you quit!
 Something like thatwon’t work on me!
 It’s okay! I can tough it outthis time around, too.
 Quit? Who?
 I can hardly wait.
 Cha! Bring it on!
 Now then, to continue,we will begin the fourth battle.
 Man, man, nothing butweirdoes all over the place!
 Don’t you say that!
 You’ve got a point.
 You, too, Sakura?!
 This isn’t the time to be laughing.
 Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka
 I never thought…I’d be fighting you, Sakura.
 And what’s more, so soon.
 Ino was a standoutamong the rookie Kunoichi.
 With Sakura as her opponent,
 will she go…no,can she go with serious intent?
 To think it would be thosetwo of all people.
 Things have gotten gloomy.
 I wonder if Ino’ll be okay.
 That’s for sure.
 What’re you going to do, Ino?
 Sakura! Good luck! Don’t lose!
 Begin!
 Oh, no. I knew it.
 Sakura’s totally blowing Ino away!
 Idiot.
 Say what?!
 If you’re not an idiot,you must be sleeping, aren’t you?
 Who…?!
 Sure enough, they are Kunoichi.
 So this is their level ofhand-to-hand combat?
 What?!
 It’s not because they’re Kunoichi.
 Huh?
 It’s just that those two are lukewarm.There’s no man or woman in battle.
 Lukewarm…?
 There!
 Kunoichi must learnnot only Ninjutsu…
 but also a wide range ofknowledge and refinement as women.
 If you don’t blend into enemy territoryand conduct yourselves as a normal woman…
 you’ll have it rough on occasionssuch as when you work as spies.
 Today’s class is flower arranging.
 Now then, everyone.
 Let’s gather flowers we like.
 Yes, ma’am!
 Ino, wait up!
 You’re such a klutz.
 I’m... not good at stuff like this.
 What about you, Ino?
 That’s no good, consideringyour name’s Sakura.
 Listen. There are tricksto things like this.
 You know, as for flower arranging,
 after you’ve decided on a main flower,you add other flowers to decorate.
 All flowers can’t beasserting themselves.
 For example…look.
 You can see those cosmosflowers over there, right…?
 For example, if they werethe main flowers…
 the thoroughwort flowersyou picked are throw-ins!
 As contrasted withspring cherry blossoms,
 cosmos flowers have thename of autumn cherry blossom
 and are the prettiest flowers of the fall.
 Also, they’re flowers withthe original meaning of “harmony,”
 so any autumn grass wouldgo perfectly with them.
 So? Do I look as niceas the cosmos flowers?
 Say, say, am I cute?
 Uh…yeah.
 Say. What’s with the pause?
 You look like you’re havingso much fun.
 Billboard Brow!
 You’ve recently reachedadolescence, haven’t you?
 Don’t get too full of yourself!
 Ami!
 Sorry! You have sucha beautiful cylinder-shaped body
 I mistook you for a vaseand put flowers in you.
 Ino!
 Shinobi flower aconite.
 It has weak toxicity, but is poisonous,so you’d best spit them out.
 Sensei!
 Only the root is poisonous, though.
 Ino is great.
 She knows everything,is stylish, and is cute.
 Even that shuriken skill.
 Her Ninjutsu is great, too…
 Compared to that, I…
 Sakura?
 If you’re a cosmos flower…
 then am I a thoroughwort?
 What’re you saying?!
 What?
 Let me see…
 In a manner of speaking,you are not a flower, but still a bud!
 You’re right.
 At this point in time…
 I don’t even plan to fightover Sasuke with you.
 What did you say?
 You and Sasuke don’t go together,and I’m totally stronger than you!
 You are beneath my notice!
 Sakura! Do you know whoyou’re lipping off to?!
 Don’t press your luck, crybaby Sakura!169.01	01:14:49:11	01:14:50:24	I feel like...
 I feel like Sakurawas out of line!
 Ino’s eyes show incredible anger.She’s scary.
 Hmm. That's not it...
 Huh?
 Sakura’s not the kind ofkid to do things
 like needlessly flaunt herown power and hurt people.
 She doesn’t like having Inotaking pity on her and pulling punches.
 I’m a bud, huh…?
 Say, Ino…
 What?
 Why…did you give this ribbon to me?
 Actually…
 I thought it’d be a waste foryou to wilt away as a bud.
 There’s no point if flowers don’t bloom.
 For all we know…
 it just might...
 become a flowermore beautiful than a cosmos.
 Thank you...
 Ino!
 Okay Sakura.Let’s hurry and go pick flowers.
 O-Okay.
 What’s wrong, Sakura?
 I got some dirt inmy eye when I fell…
 You’re so clumsy.
 Ino…
 All along, I believed in thewords you gave me then.
 I really thought that it wouldbe nice if it were so.
 It would be nice if I could geta beautiful flower to bloom…
 I set my sights on you becauseI wanted to be like you all along.
 Thanks to that, I’m here now.
 So, Ino, I want to fight you seriously.
 If I can’t surpass you at yourmost serious, there’s no point.
 W-What’s with Sakura?
 Hmm.
 Why are those two getting that heated?!
 Alas, he doesn’t even understandthe reason why he lashes out at Sasuke.
 Well, a rival is a mysterious thing,is the point.
 Huh?
 Oh, hi…
 My rival from youth, Kakashi…
 Oh, how hip and galling thatnonsensical reaction is.
 I…
 got on the same team as Sasuke.
 Why are you telling me now…?
 I won’t lose to you anymore, Ino.
 No matter what happens,I won’t lose to you either, Sakura!
 The ribbon…
 I’m giving back the ribbon.
 I gave you that ribbon.
 Besides, a headband is somethingyou put on your head, right?
 From here on, I’m no longera girl who will run after you, Ino.
 When I put this on my head,
 it will be as a female Shinobiwho can’t lose to you.
 That’s a good idea…
 Me, too…
 until that time.
 I understand…Sakura.
 – This time for sure...– This time for sure...
 – with full strength…– with full strength…
 – a fair…fight!– a fair…fight!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Since when did she get this strong?!
 Sure enough, Ino’s great.
 But I won’t lose.I absolutely will not lose.
 It can’t be. She’s evenlymatched with me now?!
 I’m not who I used to be.
 – The next hit is the decisive blow!– The next hit is the decisive blow!

 What in the worldis going on?
 I’m…so…hungry….
 Don’t keep scaring me like that…
 Oh yeah.
 It’s such a drag but…
 I bought this fruit basket asa get-well present for Choji.
 But the doctor said he couldn’t have it.
 So let’s eat it together.
 Choji? Is he that sick?
 No, no, don’t be fooled.
 He got sick from eatingtoo much BBQ.
 That’s just like him!
 Yeah well, and neither of you are the typeto have female visitors.
 So here…
 Looks good.
 W-What is it?
 Since Choji can’t have any,let’s eat in front of him.
 What a drag this guy is!
 Huh?
 No one’s here.
 Out to lunch?
 Oh well…
 Okay!
 Hmm?
 Lee, I’m putting theflowers here, okay?
 I’m still hungry!
 Are you harassing me, Shikamaru?
 Oh yeah.
 Why…save him?
 He’s an important subordinatewhom I care for.
 My body…isn’t moving.
 You jerk!
 What the hell do you thinkyou’re doing?!
 Hey Naruto…
 During Shadow Possession Jutsu,it’s moving me too! Okay?!
 Sorry! Shikamaru.
 What the hell were youtrying to do?
 Choji, are you better?
 Oh, Ino!
 All right! The age ofthe chubby has arrived!
 What were you trying to doto Bushy Brow here?!
 I was trying to kill him.
 What?!
 How can he be so calm?
 Especially when he is not able tomove with my Shadow Possession Jutsu…
 Why’d you have to do somethinglike that?
 You beat him in the match, right?
 Do you have a personal grudgeagainst him or something?
 I don't have anything like that.
 I just wanted to kill him, that’s it.
 How can you say somethingso selfish, you bastard?!
 You…you had a lousy upbringing,didn’t you?
 All you care about is yourself.
 Or there’s something weird about him.lt gives me the chills!
 If he tries anything, it’ll be too muchof a burden for me and Naruto…
 What the heck should we do?
 If you get in my way,I’ll kill you both too.
 What?! Go ahead, if you can!
 Hey Naruto, hold on!
 Should I try to scare him with a bluff?
 I know you’re strong from seeing youin the competition with him…
 But…we can keep up with you.
 We didn’t show you our best skillsin the preliminaries.
 And it’s two against one!
 You’re the one who’s at a disadvantage.
 If you’re smart, you’ll do whatI tell you and just get lost.
 I’ll say it again…if you get in my way…
 I’ll kill you.
 Where the heck do you get off…?!
 There’s no way in hellI’ll let you do that!
 I’ve been telling youto back off, haven’t I?
 This guy has the strength of a monster.You get it, don’t you?
 I have a real monster in me!I’m not going to lose to this guy!
 Huh?
 I heard Naruto was here too,so I came to see, but…
 What a mess…
 Well, I guess this means he’s okay.
 Huh?
 What’s worth making him mad,you idiot!
 A monster, huh…?
 Me too, actually.
 It’s just like you said.I had a terrible upbringing.
 When I came into this world,
 I took the life of the womansome might call my mother.
 So that I could becomethe strongest Shinobi…
 my father brought hisNinjutsu upon me,
 and so I became possessedby a Sand Spirit.
 I was born a monster.
 A Sand Spirit?
 It's called Shukaku, the living wraith ofan old monk
 from Village Hidden in the Sandwho was sealed inside the tea caldron.
 It must be a type ofcacodemon possession Jutsu,
 performed to a baby before it is born.
 To go that far…they must have been totally nuts.
 Is it possible…that there could besomething inside him too?
 What a thing for a parent to be doing!Such a twisted kind of love.
 Love?
 Don’t measure me by your standards.
 Family, huh…
 Let me tell you what kind of tiesI have to my family.
 They’re ties of hatred,ties of murderous intent…
 My family’s just lumps of flesh.
 Nourished with the life of my mother,
 I was crafted as theultimate masterpiece of the village…
 The Kazekage’s child.
 I was taught by my fatherthe innermost secrets of the Shinobi…
 spoiled, over-protected,and left on my own.
 And I thought that was love…
 Until that incident happened.
 That incident…?!
 What are you talking about?
 Just what happened?!
 In the six years since the timewhen I was 6 years old…
 My real father has tried to assassinate memore times than I can count!
 But I thought you just said thatyour father spoiled you…
 What’s going on here?
 Those who are too strong areapt to become feared.
 Born through the Jutsu,my mind was unstable…
 I guess the idiots in my village
 finally realized thatI had emotional problems…
 For my father, Kazekage,
 at the same time I wasthe ultimate weapon for the village,
 I was also a dangerous,fearsome presence.
 It seems I was labeled a dangerous figureas soon as I turned six.
 And I was treated politely simply becauseI was feared.
 To them, now I’m just a relic of the pastthat they want to see disappear.
 So what did I have in this life,why did I keep living?
 When I asked myself that,I couldn’t find the answer.
 But, as long as you’re alive,you need a reason…
 If you don’t have one,it’s just the same as being dead.
 What’s this guy saying?
 I…can understand that…
 He…is the same as me.
 So this is the answer I came to…
 I am living in order to killhuman beings other than myself.
 After living in the fear of never knowingwhen I might be murdered,
 finally I became calm.
 By killing assassins, I finallycomprehended the reason why I live…
 I live fighting for only myselfand loving myself…
 And if I see that all other peoplein this world exist
 only to make me realize that,
 there could be no worldmore wonderful.
 And as long as there areothers to kill
 who can make me feelthis happiness to be alive,
 I will never disappear.
 W-What’s this freak talking about…?
 He’s real gone!
 I was also alone…
 And suffered ‘causeI didn’t know why I was alive…
 But Iruka Sensei recognized mefor who I was…
 and that was the first timeI realized why I lived…
 But this guy…this guy grew up alone.
 And he ony feels alivewhen he kills other people.
 H-How can there be someone like this?
 The worlds we live inare too different…!
 There’s no way…that I can beat a guy like this!
 W-What’s wrong, Naruto?
 What? Shadow Possession Jutsu shouldhave stopped him from moving, but…
 Naruto!
 Naruto! Hey, get yourself together!
 What a drag this guy is!
 Naruto!
 Now, let me feel it…!
 Oh no!
 Stop right there!
 Tomorrow’s the final round!
 There’s no need to rush like this!
 Or do you just want tostay here starting today?
 Don’t leave me alone!
 I’m not bleeding, butit hurts a lot right here.
 What…am I?!
 I will…kill you all without a fail.
 Just wait.

 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 ♪ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?
 Because I had a sad dream last night.
 My eyes are red, from the tears I shed ♪
 Swollen as I cried…
 Hey!
 Neji! Naruto!
 What happened to those guys?
 It seems they were attackedby the Shinobi in question…
 So he appeared again?
 He took…he took Sumaru away.
 What? He took Sumaru?!
 Yeah!
 Anyway, helping the guys who aredown comes first!
 We’ll split up and carry them!
 Got it…
 Roger!
 Mizura…
 Naruto!
 They were attacked bythe Shinobi in the mask!
 There are no external injuries…They’re just unconscious.
 Umm… What about the others?
 Lee and Tenten are carrying themhere now.
 I see…
 Then Sumaru as well…?
 Oh… Uh…
 He was taken away bythe masked Shinobi.
 I’m sorry…
 He escaped into the Valley of Death…
 We couldn’t go after him.
 The Valley of Death?!
 Did he inhale the gas fromthe Valley of Death?
 No… I put him into a state ofsuspended animation beforehand,
 so there was no effect on his body.
 I understand using Sumaruto lure that person…
 But to use a child from our same village…
 Is it enough to make you feel ill at ease?
 We’re comrades who havealready dirtied our hands…
 What’re you doing talking nice now?!
 We’ll make those Hidden Leaf kidsbelieve that
 Sumaru’s kidnapping wasthe work of that person…
 After we’ve taken back the star,we can leave the clean-up to them…
 Hidden Jutsu:The Price of the Ninja Art: Kujaku
 Mizura isn’t feeling well andis taking a break from his training…
 Byakugan!
 What’s this…?!
 Mizura!
 You okay?
 You still need to rest…
 I must not rest at a time like this…
 I understand how you feel…
 But you shouldn’t push yourself too hard!
 I’m fine… I can walk by myself…
 Mizura! See, didn’t I tell you?!
 I’m okay by myself!
 Mother… Father!
 Mother! Father!
 Do not cry… Sumaru…
 Your parents protected the starand protected the village admirably.
 Sumaru… Look up at the sky and watch.
 There is a treasure you can see onlyin the Village Hidden in the Stars.
 If you were born as a Shinobi,
 for the sake of protecting this village,for the sake of protecting the star,
 become strong!
 Like your father and your mother… Okay?
 Lord…Hoshikage…
 Yeah, this looks good!
 Naruto…
 Huh?
 At this rate, Mizura will die!
 I felt a Chakra disturbanceand looked into it.
 Despite him lying quietly,
 his Chakra was being activatedto the utmost limit.
 If that keeps up, he’ll be killedby his own Chakra.
 That could never be…!
 There’s no mistake…
 But…!
 It’s because of the star training.
 The star has the powerto activate Chakra.
 However, many Shinobi are unableto control the amplification,
 their bodies break downand it leads to death.
 In the middle of this training,Mizura also…
 The Third Hoshikage terminatedtraining utilizing the star
 due to the large amount of casualties.
 Then why again?
 Lord Akahoshi,the current leader of the village,
 decided to resume the traininghalf a year ago.
 Something so dangerous!
 We’ll make him stop right now!
 Those born and raised in this villagedo not fear the star training!
 Why would you…?
 If they can complete the trainingby themselves
 and make every effort possible forthe village as a Hidden Star Shinobi…
 Even if the body were to be destroyed,they would be satisfied.
 That’s just…
 Go!
 Notice my Chakra… Natsuhi!
 Hotarubi… Please protect the star,protect Sumaru…
 Akahoshi’s Chakra…
 Please use this until you get better…I’m sure you will!
 Thanks, Naruto…
 But I won’t…
 It seems his condition has stabilized…
 Everyone seems okay for the time being.
 It still doesn’t sit right with me…
 Mizura and Hokuto, they’re all thinkingearnestly of the village.
 Especially that Sumaru guy.
 He thinks of the villagemore than anyone.
 What do you mean…?
 If it were for the sakeof protecting the village
 and the special comrades around me…
 I would’ve gotten impatient,wanting to get strong quickly as well.
 Yeah… That’s right…
 Yes…
 Well, this isn’t the time tobe saying stuff like that.
 The unforgivable one is that star thief!
 But, there wouldn’t be any sufferingfrom training if they didn’t use the star.
 I think so, too.
 If they have the star, everyone would trainfor the sake of the village.
 But if they do train,then their bodies get…
 Geez, I don’t know what to do!
 Our mission is to protect the star.Our first priority is to get back the star.
 We shouldn’t be meddling inthe matters that follow!
 That’s right…
 Okay.
 Got it!
 Lee and Tenten, you guys searcharound the village chief once more!
 What? Again?
 Why did the flying Shinobi escapeto the dangerous Valley of Death?
 Even though he got the star,
 why did he go so far asto take Sumaru away?
 Come to think of it… Why is that?
 The quality of Chakra ofthe one who took the star
 and the one who took Sumaru awaywere completely different.
 – Huh?! 					– What?!
 Say what?!
 That’s right…There are two masked Shinobi!
 What does that mean?
 In my opinion, there’s more tothis mission than meets the eye.
 As usual, impressive Ninja Art: Kujaku,Lady Natsuhi.
 Where is he…? Where’s Sumaru?!
 Before that, I’ll have you returnthe star to me…
 I’ll trade it for Sumaru!
 The star first!
 I refuse!
 Then I’ll take it back by forceif I have to!
 What’s so funny?!
 Akahoshi…You’re no competition to me.
 Even after you left the village,
 a few of us who were interestedcontinued training in secret!
 You think you have completedthe star training
 by training on your own?
 Verify with your own eyes whetheror not I’m no competition!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku!
 Beast!
 Such a folly… I have no choice.
 Ninja Art: Kujaku… Beast!
 Wha--?!
 To think she’d be this tough…
 Yotaka! Shisou!
 Go!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 What’re you thinking, Akahoshi?!
 I’ll have you play along with mea little while longer…Lady Natsuhi.
 Huh? What is it?
 A flow of massive Chakra…
 Is it him?!
 No mistake!
 Oh?! Who is it?!
 Our helper from the Leaf…
 The Shinobi who seized the starhas appeared!
 Lord Akahoshi is now delayingthat person…
 Please fight with us!
 All right! Let’s hurry!
 The enemy’s power is mightyand Lord Akahoshi alone cannot…
 It’s all he can do to delay the enemy.
 Right. Leave it to us!
 It seems nobody’s here.
 It seems they’ve gone out…
 There’s a faint presenceinside the residence.
 Now’s our chance. Let’s infiltrate!
 Right!
 Ninja Art: Phantom Jutsu!
 What?! Lee?
 Since when could you use Ninjutsu…?
 Tenten! It’s okay. There’s nobody in here!
 Hey, that’s not Ninjutsu!
 Kind of…
 Suspicious, eh?
 Yikes!
 Uh…uh, oh…
 Well… I guess I can do it later.
 It seems to be a medical room…
 Somebody’s being laid down in a bed.
 I wonder who it is?
 That’s…!
 Sumaru!
 Why did you make Sumaru andthe others do that star training?
 You should’ve been told bythe Third Hoshikage
 about how dangerous that training is!
 You yourself…are the answer to that!
 What?!
 That Chakra is wonderful!
 It would make for great fighting strength
 if we had one hundred, no,even ten Shinobi like you!
 The likes of the Five Great Hidden Villageswould be no match for us
 even if they all ganged up on us!
 It’s still not too late.
 Let’s make this village intoan invincible Hidden Star Village!
 It hurts… It hurts…
 My body feels like it is on fire!
 Help me…
 I must train… Star training…
 – That’s enough… That’s enough.– For the sake of Hidden Star Village…
 There’s no need to dosuch painful training!
 That sorrow must not be repeated…
 If you’re saying you’re going tocontinue this any further…!
 W-Wait! If I die, Sumaru will also die!
 You can’t do it! Natsuhi!
 Sumaru, who is more importantthan your life, is in my hands!
 There he is!He’s moving in on Akahoshi!
 All right!I won’t let him get away this time.
 Wait! He’s not an opponentyou can take on from the front.
 I’ve got a plan.
 A plan…?
 I’ll stop his Chakra,so I leave the rest to you!
 Indeed, the situation will get worseif we’re too slow.
 Got it! Be careful, Naruto!
 All right! Let’s go!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – Let’s go! 					– Let’s go!
 You again?!
 It’s more than I imagined.
 It’s impossible from the front, after all.
 What?!
 Where’s the real body?!
 Oh, no!
 I get it.
 When controlling massive Chakra,
 less attention is paid to the area aroundthe main body in spite of everything…
 Good thinking, Naruto!
 He… He did it…
 A woman…?!
 The Hidden Leaf Kid has done it…
 I can find the star if I take the time…
 But now’s my only chanceto defeat Natsuhi!
 As long as she interferes, I won’t be ableto carry out my ambitions!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku!
 Beast!
 Naruto! Look out!
 Shoot!
 Naruto!
 Something the matter, Mizura…?
 No… It’s nothing…
 Naruto…
 Mother…
 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 Oh! Everybody, I just realizedsomething important!
 What is it all of the sudden?
 Sumaru was being capturedby Akahoshi!
 Which means that the culprit who attackedeveryone was Akahoshi!
 And?
 Believe it or not!One of the masked Shinobi is Akahoshi.
 Neji said that long time ago, remember?
 Excellent, Neji.You are a sharp one!
 Can we move on?

 Naruto…!
 He came in totally late.
 Hmm? Where’s Sasuke?
 The Dosu guy I’m supposedto fight isn’t here, either.
 Hey, you guys over there.
 Throw out your chests andshow your faces to the spectators!
 You guys are the starsof this “final round”!
 Sasuke hasn’t been found yet?
 A team of several Anbu membersare searching all over,
 but they have found nothing.
 He might already be inthe hands of Orochimaru…
 If that’s the case,we may never find him.
 I understand.
 Well-well… Lord Kazekage.
 You must be tired havingcome all this way.
 No…I’m glad the arenais in the Leaf Village.
 Even though you’re still young, it wouldprobably be a tough journey for you
 if you had to go to the troubleof traveling someplace else.
 Shouldn’t you decide onthe Fifth Hokage soon?
 Please don’t treat melike an old person.
 I’m still planning onbeing Hokage for another five years…
 Now then, I guess it’sabout time to begin.
 Everyone, thank you very muchfor coming
 to the Village Hidden in LeavesChunin Exam.
 We will now begin the“final round” matches
 for the eight who made itthrough the preliminaries!
 Please watch until the end!
 If there are supposed to be eight,it looks like there’s one missing.
 I have something to tellyou before the match.
 Look at this.
 Huh?!
 There was a slight changeto the tournament.
 Check who you’ll be facingone more time.
 Here, I had more preliminarymatches than the others…
 So the Dosu guy dropped out?
 I thought I’d pound you here…
 If I did that,there’d be the possibility for me,
 as the one remaining afterthe first battle, to fight Sasuke.
 W-What are you?!
 Say…
 …say.
 What?
 Umm…Sasuke still hasn’t come.
 What’ll happen?
 I wonder if Sasuke really did sneak outof the hospital room at that time.
 Something could’ve happened to him…
 In case a competitor does not arriveby the start time of his match…
 he or she will lose by default!
 It doesn’t make sense.
 Knowing his character,he’d come even if he had to drag himself.
 Where are you going, Gaara?
 To verify my existence…one more time.
 One more time.
 What’s wrong?You should still be able to move, right?!
 Sasuke! Come on!
 Could it be…?
 Even after I warned him to avoiddoing anything to stand out…
 He didn’t kill that Sasuke Uchihaalso, did he…?
 Listen up, you guys.
 The terrain is different,but the rule is that there are no rules,
 the same asin the preliminaries.
 The matches will continue until oneor the other dies, or acknowledges defeat.
 However, if I judge that it has been settled,I’ll stop the match there.
 Arguments will not be allowed.
 Understood?
 So the first match is…
 Naruto Uzumaki.
 Neji Hyuga.
 Just those two remain andthe rest of you go to the waiting room.
 Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone!
 Hey, Hinata! These seats are open.
 Uh-huh.
 This match will be quite interesting!
 Naruto…
 Say, Sakura.
 I understand that you’re worriedabout Sasuke.
 But why don’t you cheerfor Naruto at least a little bit?
 Hmm. You’re right.
 That being said,
 with Neji as his opponent,Naruto has no chance of winning.
 That is…!
 Not so, is what you’regoing to say?
 But to think that brat wouldsurvive until this point…
 I wonder if this isas far as it goes
 for those who survivedjust by luck, after all.
 That Naruto.
 This is not a good opponent at all.
 No matter how you look at it,he can’t beat the Hyuga clan.
 Well, that’s what I thoughtat the beginning…
 But you’ll all be surprisedif you underestimate him.
 Akamaru, what’s wrong?
 What did you say?!
 What?! Where?!
 There!
 What’s Anbu, the Black Ops,doing here?
 Is something going on…?
 You seem like you wantto say something.
 I said it before, too, didn’t I?
 A failure is a failure.You can’t change.
 I promise …
 I’ll win, no matter what!
 He has the look…of being sure of himself…
 It’s as if he’s not all worked up…
 That makes itmore worthwhile for me.
 I look forward to your lookof disappointment…
 when you know the true reality…
 Stop whining.
 Let’s…get started!
 Now then, round one.
 Begin!
 Watch carefully, Hanabi.
 Nobody has inherited sucha strong Hyuga Kekkei Genkai.
 To say nothing of your older sister.
 More than big sister?
 Perhaps more than you, too.
 This time, it’s not an opponentthat can be managed easily.
 He has that Byakugan.
 Close combat is no good…
 Does Naruto know that?
 Idiot! Why would anyoneattack from the front?!
 No! Naruto.
 The opponent can seeyour Chakra Points!
 They're called Chakra Points.
 If those pressure pointsare pressed accurately…
 the flow of an opponent’s Chakracan be stopped,
 amplified or controlled at will.
 Uh-oh!
 I missed, huh…?
 In other words, he’ll pressthe pressure point if I get too close
 and I’ll become unableto use Jutsu.
 That means all I can dois fight from a distance.
 You understand, right?You have no way of winning.
 Heh… All I did was to verify your power.
 The real fight is just getting started!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You used your head,didn’t you, Naruto?!
 With the Shadow Clone Jutsu…
 Heh. He’s an interesting kid.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu isa Jonin level technique.
 To think he could usesuch an Jutsu…
 Who knows how this’ll turn out?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
 I get it. If Chakra is evenly distributedamong the clones,
 indeed, I can’t detect thereal one even with my Byakugan.
 But there’s only one real one,after all!
 Heh. Don’t be acting tough!
 If you’re going to come,then come.
 It’s pointless.
 In front of that Neji’s defense,it’s not just all attacking.
 Hey!
 Don’t…you…underestimate…
 …me!
 Here they come!
 He hit!
 Fool.
 Wha--?!
 Dang it!
 I’ll get you next time!
 Here!
 This guy…
 Does he have eyes behind him…?
 You’re going to become…the Hokage…?
 With this level, it’s impossible.
 I can generally tellwith these eyes…
 Intrinsic abilities are set.
 Figuratively speaking,everything inherent about people is set.
 Why…?
 Why are you always sojudgmental like that?
 Then…are you going to saythat anybody can become the Hokage…
 if they just work hard?
 Only a very small percentage ofShinobi are chosen to be the Hokage!
 Look more at reality!
 Those who become the Hokageare born with a destiny.
 It’s not something you becomeby trying to become it.
 It’s determined by destiny.
 People must live withintheir different respective currents
 that can’t be defied.
 The one single…destiny everyone has equally…
 ...is death.
 Those eyes…
 He still holds a grudgeagainst the head family, huh?
 So…
 So what?!
 I don’t know when to give up!Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry

 Darn it! What is going on?!
 It was clear that my punch got him,but I’m the one who was thrown!
 Darn it!Even though I promised Hinata….
 I really cannot lose ata place like this!
 The next hit will be the big onethat I’m gonna give him!
 Just prepare for it!

 Th-That attack just now…

 No time…huh?
 Ultimate Defense: Shukaku’s Shield!
 Kabuto…
 How much longer willKimimaro hold out for?
 I think he should stillbe okay for a while…
 I did all I could with the treatment…
 But there’s not nearly enoughinformation about his body.
 I think it’d be quite different if we had something
 like the medical historyand treatment data of his clan.
 What came out after looking into it
 was the bloody history of howthe Kaguya Clan became just him…
 Fools who provoked the great land ofthe Village Hidden in the Mist into battle
 with just their clanand were annihilated.
 The Kaguya Clan wasa foolish clan that liked battle.
 The battlefield was the only placewhere they could be at peace.
 But it was long ago whena simple-minded group
 that only enjoyed slaughterwas acceptable…
 The times are different now.
 Doing something like fightingonly with power
 against a governed organizationlike the Mist…
 can only be called an act of foolsrushing towards death.
 And then you saved only hewho was the youngest
 and the most exceptionalamong the Kaguya Clan…
 That kid possessed the power thatwould be feared even by the fighting clan.
 So it seems he was keptin prison the whole time.
 It would’ve been a waste to let him…die.
 Who wouldn’t wantthat rare Kekkei Genkai?
 He possesses a strongand firm bone structure
 and a defensive power torepel all kinds of physical attacks.
 And if turned to offense…
 the bones becomea most powerful weapon.
 It’s because I’ve fought him oncethat I understand this.
 That sand shield isan absolute defense, no less.
 And that unusual form…
 It’ll be okay.There’s no way it’ll be broken!
 It’s hard…
 I gathered minerals withgreat hardness from the ground,
 applied pressure with Chakraand mixed them into the sand.
 You… that unusual Jutsu…
 It’s the Kekkei Genkai, right?
 The Kaguya Clan…
 The ability which nowonly I possess.
 The last one of the clan, eh?
 Then it’ll die out here today.
 Indeed, that might happen.
 Due to sickness,my body will not last so long…
 But, the clan will not die out.
 Besides I’m not alone.
 This is the “Earth” Curse Mark…
 With this…
 I can become a part of you,Lord Orochimaru.
 Let’s get everything, Kimimaro.
 And let’s see the truth ofthis world together.
 Yes.
 You’re my “Vessel of Dreams.”
 I’m counting on you.
 They are presents from me.I hope you like them.
 Would you rather…die or obey?
 Obey…
 You will!
 Is this the best a teamof four can do?
 I’ll ask just once more…
 Which would you rather choose?
 Very well…
 As of now, we’re the Sound Ninja Five.
 Not alone, you said…?
 That’s right…
 As an existence shoulderingone part of Lord Orochimaru’s ambition…
 I will remain insideLord Orochimaru’s soul…
 for all eternity.
 Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…?
 You’re a pitiful guy.
 I used my big moves too much.I don’t have much Chakra.
 This is the last of it.
 What an amount of Chakra…
 You are something…
 I’ll sink and confine you200 meters into the ground.
 By the pressure of the sandstuck to your body,
 you’ll soon be unable to move,not even a finger…
 You did it…!This time for sure you did it.
 Dance…
 Bracken Dance!
 It is annoying…
 It feels like a long time
 when waiting eagerly forsomething you want.
 Kabuto…
 Stop talking likeyou’re humoring a child!
 I’m sorry…
 But you should knowthis the most, Lord Orochimaru.
 Nobody can beat Kimimaro,
 no matter what hindranceshould appear.
 Thanks for saving me…
 Being able to do something like this;very impressive.
 All I did was ride the sandI’m always controlling.
 You just have to know how you use it.
 Lord Orochimaru…
 I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru…
 At last… The destruction of the Leaf will begin…
 Third Hokage…I’ll teach you a thing or two.
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 What’s the matter, Kimimaro?
 No… It’s nothing.
 Even the Kazekage ofthe Hidden Sand Village
 is no match against us.
 Of course…
 Kimimaro, it’s thanks to you…
 Kimimaro!
 Kimimaro, so you can’t go on, huh?
 I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru.
 If I can’t be of use…
 then there’s no significanceto my living.
 How is your condition, Kimimaro?
 The “Destruction of the Leaf”resulted in an unfortunate near-miss.
 But the Sound Ninja Fourhave gone to pick up a new vessel…
 Lord Orochimaru’s new “Vessel of Dreams.”
 Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…?
 You’re a pitiful guy…
 You’re wrong… Far from it!
 There’s no significance to living…
 But…you might be able to discoversomething interesting
 by continuing to live…
 Like how you discovered that flower…
 Like how I discovered you.
 This is the “Earth” Curse Mark!
 With this… I can becomea part of you, Lord Orochimaru.
 Let’s get everything, Kimimaro…
 And let’s see the truth ofthis world together.
 I’m going to discoverthe truth of this world!
 With Lord Orochimaru!
 He was a persistent guy,but this is the end.
 He won’t ever come out again.
 R-Right…
 I can’t go on…
 We’re getting off…
 It’s not brainwashing!
 That person…Lord Orochimaru understands me!
 What do you guys know?!
 He’s dead…
 Could it be? Has Kimimaro…?
 The likes of Kimimaro makesno difference now…
 Sasuke… I can hardly wait for him.
 He’ll come here even by himself…
 I would have been totally hammered.
 That’s not the case.
 My sensei said it often…
 Luck is also a part of strength.
 That backseat driver?
 He’s not a backseat driver!
 It’s because…
 I wasn’t good enough at that time!
 I’m grateful for you saving me.
 But please don’t talk like thatabout my sensei!
 You, too…?
 When you feel that
 the honor of someone you reverehas been hurt,
 you yourself are hurt badlyand become enraged.
 The more important the personyou revere is to you,
 the greater the feeling…
 The clan won’t die out…I’m not alone.
 I will remain insideLord Orochimaru’s soul for all eternity.
 That person,Lord Orochimaru, understands me!
 What do you guys know?!
 Fighting for the sake of someoneimportant to you…
 He was also the sameas Naruto Uzumaki…
 But…the person who is importantto oneself
 might not always be “virtuous.”
 I wonder…
 There’s no way someone evilcan be thought of as an important person.
 No. Even if you know they’re “evil”…
 People can’t defeat solitude…
 Sasuke!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 You gotta be kidding me!
 What do you mean“for achieving your goal”?!
 Orochimaru wants youonly as a “vessel”!
 There’s no way I can let you go to him!
 This is no joke!
 If you insist on going,I have to take you back by force!

 Sakura!
 It was worth teaching you Genjutsuin survival training
 during the Genin Exam.
 You truly have a talent for it.
 Huh?
 Release the Genjutsu andwake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
 Naruto will be delighted.
 He’ll be getting a missionafter such a long while.
 What do you mean by a mission?
 Be careful…
 It’s the first A-Ranked missionsince the Land of the Waves.
 Village in Distress:A New A-Ranked Mission!
 Sensei! What do you mean by A-Rankedmission in the condition we are in?!
 What do we have to do?!
 Sasuke is chasing Gaara and companyof the Sand Village.
 Sakura…
 Release the Genjutsuon Naruto and Shikamaru,
 and go after Sasuke.
 I feel uneasy…about that unusual Chakra.
 But then,
 we should wake up Ino and Chojiand go in a large group.
 There may alreadybe quite a large number
 of Sand and Sound Shinobiwho have infiltrated this village.
 Actions lose quickness when there’s morethan the fundamental four in a squad…
 and it becomes difficult tohide from the enemy.
 You learned that in the Academy'spatrol practical training, right?
 Oh, I see! Then four meansthat you’ll come with us…
 No, I must not leave here.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 As for the rest, this Pakkun willtrack down Sasuke by scent!
 C-Could it be…the one other member is this puppy?!
 Hey! Little girl!Don’t you be calling me a cute puppy!
 I didn’t say…cute.
 Okay, Sakura! Release the Genjutsuon Naruto and Shikamaru!
 Okay!
 Release!
 What is it…Sakura?
 Get down!
 I’ll tell you later!Just stay down!
 Shikamaru…you were…from the beginning…
 Owwee!
 You were able to release Genjutsu, too!
 Why were you pretendingto be asleep?!
 Humph! I don’t want toend up getting involved!
 Heck no…I could care less about Sasuke!
 Owwee!
 W-What's going on…?
 Naruto! Behind you!
 F-Fast…
 Not just fast…
 Guy Sensei!
 Now, I’ll announce the mission!
 As soon as you’ve heard whatthe mission is, go through that hole.
 Track down Sasuke,join up and then stop him!
 Then await next ordersin a safe place.
 Huh? Did something happento Sasuke?!
 I’ll tell you the reason en route!
 Let’s go!
 Jeez… Why me?
 Hey, boy!
 Huh…?
 If this mission is a success,
 as a reward I’ll let youtouch my paw-pads.
 So don’t sulk like that!
 Huh?
 See?
 They’re soft and supple!
 Su..pple…?
 Yes, very…
 Soft and Supple!
 Let’s just go!
 H-Hey!
 Will it be okay with just them?
 They’ll be okay.Pakkun is with them.
 As long as they don’t pursue too far…
 To think I’d be able to fight you again…
 This barrier can’t be brokenunless it’s from the inside.
 If Lord Hokage would justtake out one of those four,
 we could help…
 Hey, it’s gonna start soon.
 Put up a barrier on the inside, too!
 Sure!
 Hm… It doesn’t look likeI’ll be able to get out this easily.
 You don’t really mean that.
 It’d be tougher for you if someonecame in and got in the way, right?
 Ninja Art: Tile Shuriken!
 That’s too easy!
 Striking Shadow Snake!
 With such a weak technique…
 It sucks to get old, eh,Sarutobi Sensei?
 Substitution?!
 Earth Style: Great Mud River!
 Is this it?
 I don’t think so!
 Earth Style: Earth Dragon Bomb!
 Fire Dragon Bomb!
 He’s combined Earth and Fire!
 Excellent, Lord Hokage!
 Stop the stupid act, Orochimaru.
 Very good…
 Really, I’ve been grossly underestimated.
 Did you think you could kill mewith that level of Jutsu?
 Humph… A hateful fellow as usual!
 Don’t say that.
 A high maintenance student is cute.Right, Sarutobi Sensei?
 Something’s strange…
 All of the Academy’s classesdoing self-study.
 And that smoke…
 That's coming from the directionof the exam arena.
 Isn't there some disturbanceto the east?
 I wonder if something happened…
 This is definitely strange!
 But sudden self-study issure a smack in the eye!
 It’s been like this for a while!
 Yeah. Iruka Senseiand everyone are late…
 Aren’t they, Konohamaru?
 Konohamaru?
 Yikes!
 Jeez, what is this?!
 And Mom just bought this for me!
 I’ll loan you my colored pencil.
 What’re you saying?!This color is this spring’s new color!
 Aww, what'll I do?
 That is…?
 I wonder if Naruto and the otherswent to stop Sasuke?
 Those brats?
 But surely, some Genin won’tbe able to make any difference…
 Hm? Is this the data ofthat kid back there?
 You give him too much credit.
 Think again!
 You’ll trip up if you underestimate him.
 Teachers' Office
 There is information that several unitshave already infiltrated the village…!
 We should evacuate the studentsto a safe place right away!
 Yes… And without causing panicamong the students!
 Then let’s evacuate the students
 as soon as possible underthe pretense of an evacuation drill!
 Isn’t it about timewe stopped playing around?
 This isn’t an Academy class, so…
 You have a point.
 Did you foresee your final moments?
 I won’t go easy on youjust because you’re doddering.
 I look forward to it.
 Depending on your Jutsu,
 I might have to have youstart over at the Academy!
 Please don’t disappoint me too much!
 W-Wow…
 What Chakra?!
 Yeah… It seems the air isbearing down within the body!
 Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation!
 That technique!
 One!
 He is using a Summoning Jutsuas a shield.
 And this dead person is…
 Two!
 I must stop the third one at any cost…!
 Three!
 It looks like the third one was no good.Oh well…
 It looks like I stopped the third one.
 Now, this is where it gets tough…
 He summoned those two of all people…
 I-It can’t be!Those personages are…!
 Those personages are?
 Now, what will you do,Sarutobi Sensei…?
 No…
 Lord…Third Hokage.
 Okay! Everyone, please move quickly!
 Oh, what a day!
 My favorite colored pencildidn’t have to break like that!
 Lousy evacuation drill…Self-study was better.
 Konohamaru’s been quiet, hasn’t he?I wonder what’s wrong?
 Huh? Yeah.
 After the whole school doesa long self-study,
 the whole school doesan evacuation drill.
 This is too strange!
 Okay! Stop! Get in line!
 That look on Iruka Sensei’s face…
 Something’s definitely going on here!
 And also…
 Okay, everyone!Don’t go off on your own.
 That rainbow… It's beenbugging me for a while!
 What’s that, Old Man?There’s a strange rainbow!
 It’s an unusual rainbow!
 Do you like rainbows, Konohamaru?
 Yeah! And I’ve never seensuch a pretty rainbow!
 I see, I see.But, Konohamaru…
 Hmm?
 Rainbows used to symbolize snakes…
 And it’s said that they bode evil.
 Such a pretty thing? That’s a lie!
 I see, I see.
 Symbolizes snakes…ls something happening?
 Long time no see…Saru.
 Oh, it’s you…You’ve gotten old, Sarutobi.
 I never thought I would meetthe great brothers in this manner…
 It’s regretful.
 This is bad.
 That Summoning Jutsu…
 Who in the world are they?!
 Please prepare yourselves…
 Lord First Hokage…
 Lord Second Hokage!
 That’s right…
 The one with the black hairis the First Hokage.
 The one with the white hairis the Second Hokage.
 They are both reputed tobe the highest Shinobi
 and they are the Hokageswho built the today’s Leaf Village!
 Reanimation, huh?
 This youth summoned us withthe Forbidden Jutsu, then?
 He’s something else…
 Then, Sarutobi!
 Does this mean we must…fight you?
 Let’s stop the old peopleget-together talk…
 Shall we get started?
 There’s always fighting…no matter when you live.
 You like that, don’t you?
 No good will come by deriding the deadand playing around with time!
 I get it! So that’s what happened!
 That Sasuke, getting all impatient!
 So, why am I pulled into this?!This is such a drag!
 It can’t be helped!lt’s Kakashi Sensei’s order.
 This way!
 That brat, huh…
 Let’s go!
 Everyone makes mistakeslt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
 So many regretsDon’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chestYes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakeslt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 Darn it! The pursuer is too fast!
 Once we Genin get caught,that will be the end.
 In that case,we should ambush and attack them.
 I already thought of it,but it’ll probably be no use.
 Then, what should we do?!
 There is only one choice.
 Next time, “A Shirker’s Call to Action:Layabout No More!”
 It isn’t my style,but we have no choice, I guess.

 Milady, the skies havebegun to look threatening.
 We should seek lodging for the nightbefore we get rained on.
 I see. Carry on.
 Yes, Milady.
 What dense fog?!
 We cannot see what’s up ahead.
 What was that?
 Is something the matter?
 Lady Kayo!
 The Mysterious Curseof the Haunted House
 I hear that it happened while the mistressof the Land of Honey, Lady Kayo,
 was on her way to visit the householdof her parents in Land of Candy.
 Attendants from Land of Candywent out to meet them,
 thinking it oddthat their arrival was delayed,
 only to find that the palanquin and poleshad been cast away at the mountain pass.
 I am told that Lady Kayo andall of her attendants have disappeared.
 Then, our task is to searchfor the Lady, right?
 That is so.
 Hinata’s Byakugan and Kibaand Akamaru’s keen sense of smell
 should prove helpfulin this search mission,
 and Naruto is, well, just Naruto.
 What are you saying, Grandma?
 That I have nothing in particularto recommend me?
 But isn’t that the case?
 I think that you havegood points, too, Naruto…
 Oh! Leave it to Hinata.
 Go ahead and list them upfor Grandma Tsunade!
 Come on,what are my good points?
 Er…umm… 					Let me see…
 It shouldn’t be that hard!
 I didn’t mean to make itseem that way… Um…well…
 Hey there, you two.Are you done?
 Say, Grandma, there wouldn’t beanything odd
 happening in this mission, would there?
 Something odd?
 That is to say…might there perhaps…be ghosts involved?
 Ghosts?Are you afraid of such things?
 Well, umm, er…kinda.
 There are no such things as ghosts.
 Stop talking such nonsenseand get on your way.
 Which brings us to the questionof where to, Fifth Hokage?
 Kubisaki Pass.
 K-Kubisaki Pass?As in the Broken Neck Pass?
 I knew I had a bad premonition.
 Fool!
 A Shinobi shouldn't dally about suchthings. Get to business!
 You’re scarier than any ghost!
 We’re off!
 Excuse us.
 It’s always like this with that one…
 Lady Tsunade,Kubisaki Pass is where
 the capital ofthe Land of Necks once stood isn't it?
 The ruined castle of the Kubisaki Clan,
 which met its destruction 50 years ago,must still be there.
 And what of it?
 Ruined castles may be foundjust about anywhere.
 Have you caughtNaruto’s cowardice bug, Shizune?
 N-No, that’s not it.
 Oh, this is the spot.
 The Broken Neck Pass.
 It gives me the creepssomehow, I tell you.
 It's started to rain. Let’s hurry.
 It’s really coming down!
 A castle.
 I hadn’t heard anythingabout a castle standing here.
 Somehow,I have a bad feeling about this.
 See, see?! This mission is startingto seem creepier and creepier.
 But this may be a major clue.
 Let’s go.
 Yeah. At this rate,we’ll get soaking wet.
 H-Hey, don’t be in such a hurry!
 What a magnificent castle.
 Won’t it be sort of rudeto suddenly intrude upon them?
 It’s almost night.Maybe we’ll be causing them trouble.
 Naruto, don’t tell meyou really are scared!
 N-No way, I tell you!
 Pull yourself together, Naruto.
 Let’s go.
 The door opened by itself!
 Excuse me, is anybody home?
 The lights are turned on.
 Please let us shelter herefrom the rain for a bit!
 Hey! Wait! Akamaru!
 Excuse us!
 Good evening.
 Something sure smells good.
 It’s still warm.
 Was someone hereuntil just a little while ago?
 What’s that?
 That’s one scary looking guy.
 I wonder if he’s the master of this castle.
 If he’s the master of this castle,than that makes him a feudal lord right?
 If this is the feudal lord’s castle,
 then the area around hereshould be the capital.
 But this is right on the country borderline.
 Hey! Akamaru!
 What are you doing?
 You shouldn’t eat thatwithout permission.
 – Naruto? 					– What is it?
 Don’t startle me like that.
 Just now, the painting’s eyes moved!
 You moron. How could a painting move?You’re too much of a scaredy-cat.
 The table’s set for seven people.
 So, what of it?
 The Land of Honey party thatwent missing also numbered seven.
 The Lady and her attendantsmay still be in this castle…
 Let’s split up and search for them.
 Wha…? 					We gonna split up?
 Since we’re all here together,why don’t we search together?
 What do you say, Kiba? Hinata?
 Naruto, stop talking like a kid.This is a mission!
 You don’t have to scold me so much!I know that!
 Hey! Wait a minute!
 I’m just not cut out for this kind of stuff.
 This is scarier than going to the bathroomin the middle of the night!
 This is creepy!
 No!
 Not again!
 Kiba, Hinata, Akamaru!
 I’m too scared alone, after all!
 Do you sense it, too? I’m sure this isthe scent of a human being.
 It’s here.
 There’s no one here.
 I’ll eat you up.
 Who’s that?ls someone there?
 The ceiling…
 Take that, you.
 Look at all these books!
 The History of Neck Castle…
 This was written a full fifty years ago!
 ""The enemy forceshave already surrounded the castle.
 ""Our people were brutallyslaughtered and
 ""there’re only few of the soldiersleft in castle.
 ""It seems certain thatI would not live to see nightfall either.
 ""But my thirst for vengeanceremains in the castle,
 ""and I vow with this castleto consume every last man,
 ""every human setting footwithin these walls…
 ""Signed, Gosa Kubisaki.""
 Consume?
 I’ll eat you…
 What is this?
 Gosa Kubisaki!
 Crap!
 Hinata! Hey!
 Hinata! Pull yourself together!
 Naruto…
 Naruto, Hinata, are you all right?
 Kiba, Akamaru!
 A castle that fell fifty years ago?
 What nonsense!
 That is how the scroll is dated.
 It says that everyone who enters this castlewill be eaten alive.
 True, we have been swallowed whole!
 Naruto!
 Are you okay? Hey!
 That hurt!
 There he is!
 I-I’m sorry!
 What is this?
 This isn’t the armor of the Kubisaki Clan.
 I wonder if this belongedto an enemy soldier…
 There’s some more over there.They are different armors.
 Those armors bearthe crest of the Kubisaki Clan.
 Let’s hurry up and get out of here!
 That’s the same armor as in the painting!
 Could it be…that this is the real Gosa Kubisaki?
 Gosa Kubisaki?
 What’s going on?
 He’s melting!
 What is this?
 Something smells really sour.
 There is somethingstrange about this castle.
 Hinata!
 Yeah.
 Byakugan!
 The whole wall is coveredwith a flow of Chakra.
 Why?
 It’s moving!
 This wall seems to be alive!
 What if…
 Gentle Fist!
 A-Are you all right, Hinata?
 Uh-huh.
 I’ve seen something very similar to thissomewhere before.
 The giant toad summonedby the Pervy Sage…
 from inside its stomach!
 Inside its stomach?!
 Then, I wonder if, by chance,this smell could be…gastric juices?!
 Gosa Kubisaki invokedthe Summoning Jutsu
 before the fall of the castle.
 But the thing he summoned…
 was big enoughto swallow the entire castle whole.
 From the time we entered the castle,we, too, have been gobbled up!
 But, why would this thing go to the troubleof transforming to a castle to eat us?
 I don’t know.
 What was that?
 Oh!
 H-Help!
 Are you the Lady of the Land of Honey?
 She’s embedded in the wall.
 We are fromthe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 We have come to help you.
 Here, I’ll help you out now.
 It’s no use.
 Please hang on!
 Oh no! This thing is rounding upall the humans inside here
 and returning to its original form.
 At this rate, we're in danger too!
 Naruto, Hinata,we’ve got to get out of here!
 Man Beast Clone!
 Fang over Fang!
 I am the castle.
 and by order of my master Gosa,I am to eat all who set foot within.
 Naruto!
 Ouch…
 I’ll eat you.
 How can we get out of its stomach?!
 I don’t know.
 If this creature was Summoned,
 then there should bea scroll for the contract.
 If we tear up the scroll, then this creatureshould return to the world it came from.
 Is that so?
 – Hinata! 					– Right!
 Byakugan!
 Found it.
 It’s up above.Probably in the castle tower.
 How are we supposed toget up there in this situation?!
 The wall’s Chakra havebegun to stabilize again.
 Who's that?
 Gosa Kubisaki!
 I won’t be fooled again.
 That, too, is just a phantomcreated by the Summoning.
 Wait!
 He looks different from the one before.
 Wh-What’s he doing?
 He seems to want us to follow him.
 Huh? He disappeared!
 Naruto, over there.
 Oh, it’s the scroll!
 It's starting to act up again.Hurry, Naruto!
 Right!
 This is…
 It’s the true formof the Summoned animal.
 The concentration of acid is increasing.
 Hey, let’s hurry and wind things up!
 Wait a minute.
 What if, when this summoned animalgoes back to where it came from,
 it takes us with it, too?
 We’ll just have to take our chances.We gotta do this!
 Right.
 Did that do it?
 What the--?!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Over there, Naruto.
 It should be possibleto tear the wall at that spot.
 Okay! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Naruto!
 The lord of this castle must have died
 resenting the peoplewho seized the castle from him.
 But, he also led usto where the scroll was hidden…
 Then, does that mean thathe decided to let go of his grudge?
 Surely that must be the case.
 What’s more, he must have felt sorry for
 the Summoned animal thatnobly served him for fifty years,
 and wanted to release it.
 I see.
 Then maybe he was waitingfor someone
 to release the Summoned animalfrom its spell.
 And now, it has finally been able toreturn to its own world.
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say,“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”

 Hush. He doesn’t look himself.
 He sure looks gloomy.
 The results were bad.I'd say considerably.
 Huh? ""Considerably""?
 It can’t be helped.lt must have been considerable.
 Then…could it be that Bushy Brow is…?
 Yes… I’m sorry but…

 That day's faint wind blows away

 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears

 I did it…Shikamaru…
 What?!
 I can’t believe I had to get tothe second state
 for an opponent like this one…
 Slamming Palm
 What…What is that appearance?!
 Now that it’s come to this, it’s over.
 In the second state, I can put out ten timesmore power than I have thus far.
 I’m invincible.
 It’s too painful to move…
 Who knew that the side effectsof the Curry Pill would be this intense.
 This is what happens…
 to a powerless scum for butting in!
 Playing Ninja better suits you!
 Raise your hand if you’re playing Ninja.
 Wait…
 Rock, paper…scissors!
 Split!
 One, two, three…
 W-Wait!
 99…100!
 Hey! I said, split!
 Ouch!
 Found you!
 Give up quietly, the two of you!
 We finally caught ‘em!
 I’m sick of this!The team with Choji always loses!
 Sorry…
 I need a lot of Chakrafor this ""second state.""
 I’ll take whatever Chakrayou have left!
 Well then, I’ll take them now.
 There’s not much left…
 You’re empty!
 I haven’t had nearly enough to eat…
 I said I haven’t had enough to eat!
 Huh…?
 What, just one last piece, huh…
 When I said I haven’t hadenough to eat…
 Just as I thought, you’re the scumused as a sacrificial pawn.
 Die…you pitiful fatso, the odd man out.
 I won’t let you play Ninja with us!
 Why?
 Because if we let you play,we’ll lose.
 You’re slow.
 Yeah, but…then the numberof people won’t be even.
 Japanese chess is funbecause the number of pieces are even.
 A piece that is useless isthe same as not having that piece!
 Yeah, that’s right!
 We’re the ones with fewer peopleand we’re not complaining.
 Hurry up, let’s do it!
 if it’s okay with you, then it’s fine…
 Okay, it’s settled!
 We can win it!
 Yes!
 Where are we gonna hide this time?
 And um, the whole Akimichi Clanis fat and slow…
 That’s what everyone says.
 Really...
 But Choji, you’re a kindhearted guy…more than everyone else.
 One day, you’ll surely make friendswho’ll see that quality of yours.
 And then you should cherishthose friends
 and be the kind of friendswho believe in each other…
 Can I really make…friends like that…someone like me…?
 Rest in peace…
 you’re not the only oneI’m going to get.
 After I kill you,
 I’m going to get the cruel, sleazy,mean guys who used you as a sacrifice!
 Because he…promised…
 You better catch up with us…Choji.
 Okay!
 He’s definitely going to defeatthe opponent and come after us…!
 Yep!
 That’s right…he can do it.
 Okay! While I’m here…
 Me too…
 All right, everyone,
 we get Sasuke backbefore Choji catches up!
 Wait!
 All right! Here we come!
 He’s late…that Jirobo…
 He’s greedy and eats so much…
 He’s probably squeezing out Chakraeven from the marrow of their bones.
 I wish he had switchedwith me already…
 Here, I’ll give it back!
 Well, then…
 If I linger,I won’t be able to catch up.
 It’s about time to put an end to this.
 The Chili Pepper Pill is left…
 But…if I take that…I’ll die, without a doubt…
 Don’t you dare die, Choji…
 We’ve been doing things togethersince that day…
 Oh…! You…
 You…were there just now…
 What about playing Ninja?
 It was a drag,so I pulled myself out from it.
 Huh…?
 By the way, that’s my special seat.
 Your special seat?
 I like to lie on my back andlook at the clouds on a nice day like this.
 You’ve come to look at clouds?
 Mind if I sit there?
 Oh…sure!
 This is a good place.You can see the clouds well.
 Yeah…
 Why don’t you…
 What…?
 watch the clouds with meand lounge around?
 Okay!
 You know! I-I brought snacks.Want some?
 Oh, that’d be great!
 Thanks.
 Eating potato chipswhile watching clouds…this is the best.
 Yep!
 My name is Shikamaru…from the Nara Clan.
 You… What’s your name?
 It’s Choji! Choji Akimichiof the Akimichi Clan!
 Choji, huh…I think I’ll get along with you.
 Me, too!
 We’ll always do things togetherfrom now on, too.
 Choji…!
 Shikamaru… Sorry…I can’t go…
 It’s over…
 But, this guy…
 I have to beat him…even if it means death.
 No matter what you do now,it’s too late!
 Crushing Palm!
 Wh-What’s that…?
 But…
 Boulder Blow!
 It’s no good!
 I’m 100 times stronger than before!
 They say that foodcan be a reason
 for people to hold a horrible grudgeagainst somebody.
 The blow just now…was for eating the last bite of my snack…
 No way!
 This guy has so much Chakra thathis body has changed physically!
 And this is…
 for making fun of me by calling mea sacrificial pawn and fat!
 But what I can’t forgive you formore than anything else …
 You sure do suffer whenyou have a stupid leader. You underlings!
 Well… I’ll kill you losers
 before you suffer workingunder a glum shadow lover like him!
 You should blame your stupid leaderfor choosing you!
 You insulted my best friend!
 More than mocking meby calling me fat,
 and poaching the last biteof a four-star meal…
 I can’t forgive you for that!
 All of my Chakra…to my left hand!
 Uh, uh-oh…!
 This blow…is heavier than my life!
 W-Wait…! Don’t be hasty…!
 I…I won.
 Me… I won!
 Everyone…
 But Choji…
 you’re a kindhearted guy,more than everyone else…
 One day, you’ll surely make friendswho’ll see that part of you…
 And then you should cherishthose friends
 and be the kind of friendswho believe in each other.

 all on his own this time.
 But still, one certainly can’tsay he’s stable yet…

 To think that of all the frogshe summoned that one…
 I did it…
 Hey, you little brat!
 Huh?
 Huh? Huh? Huh?!
 You little brat…
 On whose head do you thinkyou’re raising a ruckus!
 This is the top of Gamabunta,the Chief Toad’s head! You idiot!
 Quiet down…
 Oh!
 W-What the heck is this guy?!
 He seems pretty awesome, but…
 Gimme a break!
 Just when I’m breathing the air ofthe free world after a long time,
 some weird kid is raisinga ruckus on top of my head.
 Hey! Jiraiya! Where are you?!
 What the heck doyou think you’re doing?!
 Hmm… This doesn’t look good…
 ’Cause even I can’t handlethat Gamabunta…
 Jiraiya! Hurry up andshow yourself, you idiot!
 Hmmm…lt would be troublesome ifthat Gama found me out…
 I better get my ass out of herewithout any further delay.
 Hey, little brat!
 Y-Yes…?
 Where’s Jiraiya?
 Huh…? Jiraiya…?
 Who’s that…?
 I’m talking about that lecher whocalls himself Toad Sage or something!
 Where’s Jiraiya? Huh?!
 S-Scary…
 If you just follow my orders,
 I wouldn’t mind making youmy henchman!
 Hurry up and answer me!
 Okay! If you’re talking aboutthe Pervy Sage,
 he’s on the cliff up there,Chief Toad.
 Up there, huh…?
 Um… Can I ask you one question?
 What is it?
 What business do you havewith that Pervy Sage?
 That’s the question I wantto ask that pervert!
 What the heck does he wantsummoning me to a place like this?!
 B-But…
 What is it?
 I’m the one who summonedyou, Chief Toad..
 I fell off the cliff…
 and thought maybe youcould come to my aid…
 Please…
 Hmm…?
 What does a kid like you thinkhe’s saying out of the blue.
 There’s no way a little squirt likeyou could summon a guy like me.
 It’s…it’s true…I really truly summoned you…
 Believe it!
 You jerk frog!
 Huh…?
 You’ve been condescending to me
 and saying whatever youplease since earlier on!
 Since I summoned you,I’m your master!
 Huh…? What was that?
 Hey, who do you thinkyou’re talking to?!
 A little squirt like you,
 who isn’t even able to exchange cupsof sake as a pledge of friendship,
 is saying to Lord Gamabunta,that you’re his master?
 I could kill you for that! Hey!
 Huh…
 Oohhh…
 It looks like he emerged on top,that Gamabunta…
 Awesome…
 I hate to tell you this, little brat,
 but even if I were to concedea hundred steps to you…
 No, concede a thousand steps to you,
 and even if it really was true thatit was you who summoned me…
 If you’re the kind of guy whofalls off my back that easily,
 there’s no way I couldadmit you as my master…
 Huh?! Huh…?!
 Now then…I’m here in thefree world after a long time…
 If Jiraiya doesn’t haveany business with me,
 I think I’ll kick back for a while.
 Hey! Wait!
 Why don’t you just go homeand sleep or something?
 ’Cause it looks like you’re incapableof serving even as my henchman.
 Darn it!
 W-What the heck do you thinkyou’re doing, you little brat?
 If my making you recognize thatI summoned you
 depends on my not fallingoff your back, then…!
 Then I won’t get off your backthe entire day today no matter what!
 What?!
 And by my doing that I’ll makeyou recognize me as your master!
 You little brat! Don’t get all carried awaythinking I’ll go easy on you!
 Huh?!
 Fall!

 There’s not enough Chakra!
 Listen carefully, Chief Toad!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
 I’m a man who will become Hokagein the future. Don’t forget that!
 Who cares!
 This is getting pretty interesting.
 Hey!
 Oh my gosh!
 Sorry Naruto,but I’ve gotta get back to work!

 Bust off!

 Huh... Those guys areeathing barbecue again, huh?
 A reward for having trainedearnestly…maybe?
 I thought you were told not tolet Gaara out of your sight…
 Don’t worry…even somebody like him…
 wouldn’t dare to do anythingin broad daylight.
 More importantly,that guy Shikamaru or whatever,
 he’s the first guyyou’re fighting, right?
 Shouldn’t you be formulatinga battle plan?
 Humph… There’s no way I wouldlose to a guy of that level…
 Besides…
 You botched it, didn’t you?
 Huh?
 If you had taken the examone year earlier,
 you would have madethe Chunin easily…
 Don’t say it…
 What was that?!
 The upcoming Chunin Exam…
 I’ll have the three of you fromour Sand Village take the exam…
 But the reason for doing thatis not to pass the Chunin Exam!
 It is to use the opportunityof the Chunin Exam…
 to crush Leaf Village!
 But why…? Don’t we havea treaty with Leaf Village?!
 That treaty is the problem.
 Oh.
 What do you mean?
 You Genin are not aware ofthe detail but…
 At the time the treaty was concluded,
 that idiot feudal lord of Land of Windnot only aggressively scaled down
 the arsenal ofthe Hidden Sand Village…
 he delegated to the Leaf Village
 matters that should have been handledby our country, and moreover,
 significantly cut our country's budgetand slashed the number of Shinobi.
 When we have an idiot leader,
 we, the arms and legsof the country, suffer.
 The only choice we had leftwas to improve the quality
 of each and every Shinobi in orderto maintain our country’s military power…
 That’s why Shinobi likeyou were created…
 Gaara…
 The Land of Wind’s security isin extreme danger right now!
 But the aidesof that idiot feudal lord…
 don’t have a clue!
 Lord Kazekage ,
 who detected the weakening in the militarystrength of the Hidden Sand Village,
 joined hands withthe Hidden Sound Village
 and decided to take downthe Hidden Leaf Village…
 In addition to restoring SandVillage authority…
 this needs to be done in orderto make that idiot feudal lord
 aware of the importance ofcrisis preparedness…
 If any more time passes,our Sand Village will totally lose
 its military capabilitiesagainst the Leaf Village …
 Now is the only chance …
 The success of that mission…Gaara…depends on your work…
 Yeah…
 If the strategy is carried out,
 it will certainly lead to warwith the Leaf Village.
 We’ll be at war again…?
 The cost to human life in implementingthe treaty was very great…
 and if it is broken…then again…many people will die…
 H-Hey…Temari…
 This is the will of Lord Kazekage.
 Of Lord Kazekage?
 After all, Shinobi are simplytools for fighting.
 The treaty did nothing more thanjeopardize our very existence.
 This is a super A-rank mission.
 See it through with great care!
 Okay.
 Yes…
 A day sure is long whenone’s not doing anything.
 I guess…
 Darn… What an obstinate little squirt.
 Goodness…that Naruto seemslike he’s in agony…
 He must have exhaustedmost of his Chakra
 when he summoned Gamabunta…
 Look, look, isn’t that pretty…
 The rainbow…
 Gorgeous…
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely gorgeous, isn’t it.
 Good work, Baki.
 Lord Kazekage, I successfullymoved all three pawns
 to the real battle as planned.
 The agreement with the Sound Village sidehas been progressing with no problem too.
 Yes, sir.
 This is…
 A decisive action plan fromthe Sound Village.
 You still have something you want?
 Well…
 What is it? Come out with it.
 Yes, sir…I was wondering if youcould position some soldiers
 near the border on the pretext ofundertaking a tactical exercise.
 With only the four of us…
 The Leaf Village isn’t idiot either.
 Their Anbu black opsare moving about.
 If we do that, they will see right throughwhat we’re contemplating.
 But with only our currentmilitary capability…
 That’s why I sent Gaara andthe others out there.
 The restoration of the authority ofthe Hidden Sand Village is resting on you.
 Well… Go.
 Yes, sir.
 There’s only a little more time remaininguntil the sun sets completely…
 and if I don’t fall off…
 I’ll be the master!
 What’s that to me?!
 You came up with thiswhole thing unilaterally.
 I’m not falling off, no matter what!
 That Naruto…he’s already way past his limit…
 I wouldn’t be surprised ifhe fell off any minute now…
 I could simply ignore whata brat like him says…
 but taking a lick really irritates me.
 I'm gonna bring thisto an end once and for all...
 Hey, brat…what’s your name?
 Naruto!
 It’s Naruto Uzumaki!
 Naruto Uzumaki… Naruto!
 Don’t hold it against me if you die!
 Oh…
 That Gamabunta!
 Now it’s a matter of pride for him, too!
 Huh?!
 This won’t do!
 No! This is the sizzling young ladies’entertainment spot!
 I’m not falling off whenI’m so close to succeeding!
 Hey!
 Oh…
 What?!
 That Naruto…
 He’s squeezing out yet more Chakrafrom that condition he’s in.
 I’m falling…
 How do you like that, Gamabunta?I’m still on your back!
 It’s my victory!
 Oh no! If he falls like that he’ll die!
 Too bad for you… You almost made it.
 To think that he could hold out like thatagainst a tough opponent like Gamabunta…
 Hm?!
 That, Jiraiya, meddling in…
 I am fully aware of the fact that…
 this guy here summonedme all on his own.
 I mean, it’s the first time sincethe Fourth Hokage
 that somebody climbed on my head.
 As might be expected,he must be totally drained.
 I don’t mind dispensing someof my power to him but…
 Taking him to that place would be best.
 Huh? What!

 What, if you’re not a customer, beat it.
 Then I’ll order something…I’ll have ramen.
 I’ll have a hamburger steak with cheese.He’ll have milk.
 This is funny. Milk?Hamburger steak with cheese?
 And ramen on top of that?
 Are you making a fool of me?Get out, brats!
 If it’s the money, we have some.
 That’s not the issue.
 Oh… It’s dangerous for kidsto carry such a large amount of money…
 I’ll take charge of it for you.
 After all, there are lots of bad menin this town.
 Hey, what’re you doing?Are you still in?
 Oh, just a minute.I got the money. I’ll be right over.
 Huh? What’s with you?Hey, let go!
 You’re the one who’ll let go.
 How about that?
 You brat… You want to fight?!
 That’s the plan… Bring it!
 You punk!
 Hold it, Naruto.
 Naruto, look around.
 This is bad.
 Master, milk.
 Who the hell are you?
 O-Okay, coming right up!
 Here you are.
 Thanks.
 Now, no need to hesitate.Drink up.
 It’s a treat fromold billiard-ball head over there.
 ""Billiard-ball head"" means me?Knock it off, you jerk!
 Who would treat some puppy milk?
 You want to get killed?!
 Bounty, Michizo Manaka.
 You can take the credit, Master.
 Take the money for the milkfrom his bounty…
 And the money to repair the table, too.I don’t need change.
 He’s strong.
 Are you in the same trade as I am?Sorry about that.
 Wait!
 Something you want?
 Who the heck are you, old man?
 ""Old man,"" you say?
 I’m Sazanami, a bounty hunter.
 How cool!
 Old man!
 Say, say…That thing earlier was cool.
 Hm? The iai-nuki?
 It was so fast I couldn’t see whenyou drew your sword.
 It was really surprising…
 I bet that’s what they meanwhen they say “In a blink of an eye.”
 Life and death is on the linefor us bounty hunters…
 No matter how many lives we can have,it wouldn't be enough
 if we couldn’t draw our swordfaster than others.
 Say, say! Say, say!What’s a bounty hunter?
 Let’s see…
 There are people who offer a bountyin order to capture bad guys.
 And a bounty hunter catchesthose bad guys and receives the bounty.
 Hmm.
 Then this guy hasa bounty on him, right?
 Boy, that’s…
 Why’s there so much money on his head?
 This guy’s just a simple thief…
 A simple thief, you say?
 Boy, this guy’s a super A-rank bounty
 who has killed dozens of peoplefor the sake of stealing.
 What?!
 No way.
 Say what?
 What’s the meaning of this?I haven’t heard about that.
 The feudal lord who commissionedthis mission
 might not have known about that.
 Mission?
 Yeah. We’re Hidden Leaf Ninja
 and we came to this townto capture Gosunkugi.
 Leaf?
 So you’re Ninja, huh?
 This is interesting.
 So even kids like thisare qualified to be Ninja?
 What?! Don’t make fun of us!
 Well, don’t get so mad.Sorry about that…
 I’ll treat you guys to something. Milk?
 We’re not Akamaru.I want ramen!
 Then I’ll have a hamburger steakwith cheese.
 I-I-I guess I’ll have ramen, too.
 Okay. Come with me.
 Jeez, no way would there beramen in a bar.
 Hey, old man. Would even miso ramentopped with pork be okay?
 Sure, have anything you like.
 What is this? We’re rapidly moving awayfrom town.
 I don’t see a ramen shop anywhere.
 Now then…
 I don’t see any ramen shops.
 So what I said earlier about treatingyou guys is canceled.
 Sorry, but you guys are going to die here.
 O-Old man…
 You guys are going to die here.
 Hey, old man…What’s the idea?
 To think you guys would knowthat Gosunkugi is in this town.
 So what if we do know?
 Gosunkugi is my prey…I can’t hand him over to you.
 Knock it off!You should just go get him yourself.
 No, even if you guys are kids,
 it’s a different story when it comesto Leaf Ninjas.
 It’s better to have fewer…wait, no competitors.
 Old man.
 Here I go.
 Hinata!
 That’s dirty!
 Naruto!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:All-Four Jutsu!
 Interesting.
 Bring it.
 I won’t lose at speed!
 Damn it! Where are you?
 Too slow.
 Boy…
 Now you’re the last one.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Oh…
 I won’t let you do as you please!
 Over here!
 You’re mine.
 Almost.
 Forgive me, boy.
 I’ll be the one to defeat him,no matter what.
 Akamaru.
 Damn it! He got us good.
 Hinata, you okay?
 Y-Yeah.
 Where’s Sazanami?
 Could it be he went after Gosunkugi?
 I can’t just sit here like this!He’ll beat us to the draw.
 Damn it! Where is that old man?
 Did he leave town?
 Going after Gosunkugi?
 Akamaru, we’re counting on you!
 The most crucial treasure is missing here.
 Filthy hyena.
 I waited a long time for youto make your move.
 Unfortunately, I havean important job to do.
 Time is valuable.I’ll get right to taking care of you.
 Ninja Art: Torpedo Nail.
 Gosunkugi, here I come!
 You can’t move anymore.
 It’s over.
 Finish him.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Gosunkugi, you’re under arrest!
 Damn it. Reinforcements, huh?
 Retreat!
 I won’t let you get away!
 Wait.
 Boy…
 You must not go.
 Old man!
 H-Hey, Old Man Sazanami.
 Stay away from him.He’s too much for you guys.
 How could such a strong guy be beaten?
 Gosunkugi isn’t a mere thief.
 He’s a Shinobi, same as us.
 Shinobi.
 Sazanami!
 Is this one of Gosunkugi’s comrades?
 You! As I recall,you were in the bar before…
 Damn!
 Who was that guy?
 Hm, what?
 A wanted flyer.
 Did he mistake us for Gosunkugi?
 No, that’s not it.
 ""This man who calls himself Tokichiis a major criminal
 who has killed a family of three…""
 ""He has a bird-shaped birthmarkon his chest.""
 A bird-shaped birthmark…?lt couldn’t be…
 What is it, Hinata?
 I can't tell becausehis face is covered with scars…
 But he has…a bird-shaped birthmark.
 Oh!
 He has a bounty on his head, too?
 What the heck is going onwith everything?
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 A long, long time ago just recently,on an overcast clear day…
 It was night since morning.
 The righteous rogue Sazanami’sstring of his past unwinds and frays.
 Ah, the fatal foe Gosunkugi!
 Although the situation isnow clear to me,
 there are times whena Shinobi cannot back out!
 Hey, hey, hey, Gosunkugi!
 Give it up and submit to arrest!

 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with  youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 Okay! Drink! Sing!
 Let's have fun!
 Good grief…This is too much for…a pre-celebration.
 Did you take care of the business?
 Yes…
 More importantly,the rain’s starting to let up.
 Shouldn’t you quickly put an endto this farce of a race?
 Fine.
 Guess I’ll go for a run!
 A-Above here, huh?
 Yeah…
 It’s a quite a long staircase,believe it.
 They’re also calledthe Stone Steps that Tear Hearts Apart.
 Heh, cool!
 Let’s go at a sprint!
 Hey, he’s kidding, right?
 What kind of stamina does he have?
 Boss.
 It seems Idate is heading this way!
 He hasn’t run away,just like you said, Boss.
 Of course…
 I saw potential in him.
 Now, it’s just a little more!Run Idate!
 A Fierce Battle of Rolling Thunder
 Hey…you…!
 Huh?
 Let me tell you…
 It’s not like I trust youor anything yet, okay?
 Yeah, yeah whatever.
 It doesn’t really matter to me,believe it.
 There’s a personwho still trusts you, right?!
 During the Chunin Exam…
 Huh?
 You said that a tenth problemappeared, right?
 Yeah. It was a weird problem to determinewhether you’d take the problem or not.
 Three years ago…
 I got a similar problem…
 Okay, now I’m going togive the tenth problem.
 The tenth problem…
 What kind of problem isBig Brother going to give?!
 The tenth problem is a battle
 with the Three-Man Squadyou were teamed up with.
 The three of you will compete againsteach other this exercise.
 And among you…one of you will be failed!
 And the one who is failedwill remain a Genin for life
 and we will never againlet them take the Chunin Exam!
 N-No way…
 Then for what purposewere we together until now?
 I make the rules here.
 Back-talk is not allowed at all!
 If you want to withdraw,you should do so.
 Withdrawing here andwaiting half a year is also a way.
 If one person amongthe three withdraws,
 of course all three memberswill be disqualified.
 But you will be allowedto take the Chunin Exam
 one more time, in half a year.
 So, what will you do?
 One comrade will be dropped.
 I have the confidence to pass.
 But, one of them will remaina Genin for life.
 It’s a choice betweencomrades and your life.
 If you’re going to quit,now’s the time.
 Is there nobody elsewho’s going to withdraw?
 We’re good, then.
 Okay, to everyone whohas remained here…
 I render you disqualified!
 Wh-Why…?
 H-Hold on a minute!
 I prepared myself and remained here!
 Such preparedness is below contempt!
 Scums like you don’t havethe qualifications to become Chunin!
 That’s all!
 I see…
 What kind of a test was itfor you guys?
 I forgot…
 I mean, it was explained to me,but I didn’t really get it.
 Trusting in my big brother’s words,I remained in the classroom.
 And yet I was failed!
 No way could I take that.I questioned my big brother.
 Big Brother!What’s up with that test?!
 A Shinobi reads the double bluff.
 You should’ve understoodthat was the test.
 Even so, I can’t accept that!
 No matter how dangerous,
 isn’t it necessary to havethe courage to plunge into any mission?!
 Idate.
 Can you really not accept it?
 Of course not, such a…
 You…quit as a Ninja.
 If you’re telling me to quit,then I will.
 But tell me why I’m no good!
 That’s something you shouldrealize yourself,
 with your own power.
 To this day…I don’t understandthe answer to that.
 So after that,you were deceived by Aoi, huh?
 Yeah, that’s right.
 We made it…to the top!
 I’m going by myself from here.You rest!
 Huh?! You still saying stuff like that?!
 I can’t be asking you guysto help any more.
 There’s no point if I don’t win by myself,on my own strength!
 Oh…hey! Idate!
 I can make it! It seemsSakura’s special medicine has worked!
 Blast!
 This doesn’t hurt!
 I’m back in the game…from here!
 If we cross this suspension bridge,it’s Ouzu Island, huh?
 We should hurry.
 It seems Idate has made itto the Modoroki Shrine.
 What?!
 It seems we underestimatedthe Leaf Genin a bit…
 You jerk!You didn’t finish them?!
 Now’s not the time to be talkingabout stuff like that.
 Please cross the bridge quickly!
 Useless Ninja!
 Hey! I’m only helping youbecause it’s the job.
 I’ll waste you if you keeptalking smart to me.
 I-I’m sorry…
 If you’ve understood,then get a move on!
 Y-Yes!
 There he is! That Fukusuke jerk!
 This is quite something.
 I never thoughtyou’d make it this far.
 That’s the…Blade of the Thunder God!
 Stop!
 Stop!
 Stop kicking a dead horse.
 Nobody is a match forthe legendary Blade of the Thunder God,
 said to have been usedby the Second Hokage.
 You should know this well.
 After all, you’re the manwho stole this for me.
 Blast…
 Mud balls, huh?lt’s just like a kid’s fight.
 Sorry, I didn’t haveany Kunai Knives.
 Naruto…
 But you won’t be able to dodgethe next ball just with that.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 He’s concentratingthe Chakra in his palm.
 Here I come!
 Here I come!
 Once more!
 I don’t know whatyou intend to do, but…
 Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
 Too bad.
 This Blade of the Thunder Godcuts through anything!
 Even Chakra itself is no exception.
 Naruto!
 I have to make doubly sure
 so that nothing troublesomewill happen again.
 I’m your opponent!Keep your hands off Idate!
 Humph, are you stillsaying such things?
 Saving each other, protecting each other,trusting each other.
 It ticks me off!
 The weak can't surviveif they don’t support each other.
 So they trust people easilyand are betrayed.
 Weaklings like you guysshould just run about and away.
 Right, Idate?
 It was like that alsowhen you stole
 this Blade of the Thunder God, right?
 I can see it.That’s the Village Hidden in the Rain.
 Aoi Sensei?!
 Aoi Sensei!
 Idate…
 B-Big Brother…
 You idiot!
 Go back to the village immediatelyand surrender yourself!
 You?!
 Do you know whatyou have done?
 What?!
 Strict as always, eh?And he’s your cute little brother.
 But it’s truly perfect thatyou’ve shown up here.
 Aoi Sensei…
 This forbidden Jutsu scrollcan’t be deciphered
 unless you’re Jonin class.
 I’ll have the brothersbetray the Leaf Village together.
 Ibiki, please decipher it already.
 I refuse.
 So are you choosing death,together with Idate?
 Such as he is,he’s also a Shinobi.
 He’s not afraid of death.
 It doesn’t seem so.
 This face is one taut with fear.
 I’m quitting as a Ninja!So please don’t kill me!
 Please decipher it.
 You don’t want to seeyour cute little brother killed
 before your eyes, do you?
 Little brother, you say?
 That fool?
 Big Brother…
 Such a threat means nothing to me.
 Hey, Ibiki, is the Village Hiddenin the Leaves that important?
 Even if you protect it atthe risk of your own life,
 you’re nothing but a pawn!
 So that’s whyyou became a traitor?
 You’re a pathetic man!
 You punk!
 Idate!
 You, run away!
 What about you, Big Brother?
 I’ll go, after I clean upthe mess here!
 I don’t think so!
 Big Brother!
 Go, quickly!
 But Big Brother…!
 Go! Having you stay is a burden!
 I won’t let you!
 Go!
 So appalling…
 that he’d riskhis life for such an idiotic guy.
 All you could do after thatwas run.
 You could’ve returnedto the village and called for help.
 But you didn’t do that.
 Thinking Ibiki was deadwas no excuse!
 The fact is, he was alive…
 In that regard,lbiki was admirable.
 Not only did he completely endurerepeated interrogation,
 but he also retrievedthe Forbidden Jutsu scroll...
 without having confessed to anything!
 And to think that he didall this
 for his good-for-nothing little brother.
 You betrayed your village,abandoned your older brother,
 and came to think of only yourself.
 Even Ibiki who is blood-relatedand risked his life to save you,
 you didn’t trust him!
 Afraid of being accused,
 you didn’t trust the Village Hiddenin the Leaves, your birthplace…
 You trust nobody.
 You’re not trusted by anyone.
 For me, there is no pupilas excellent as you.
 As a reward,I’ll let you die in one instant.
 Idate!
 Sasuke…Sakura!
 Rest, Naruto!
 I’ll beat this guy!
 Don’t be acting cool, believe it.
 You can’t beat me, no matterhow many people show up.
 Me, Aoi Rokusho,
 the Rain Jonin who possessesthe Blade of the Thunder God.
 Is that so?
 Interesting.
 The Blade of the Thunder Godand my Chidori!
 Let’s test which is better!
 The rumors were true.
 The survivor of the village’s honorableUchiha Clan…
 is just a good-for-nothing kid…
 Sasuke!
 Run, Sakura!
 He’ll show no mercy,no matter who the person is.
 Everyone will be killed!
 No way!
 Huh?!
 We’ll protect you,no matter what.
 We promised that, didn’t we?!
 Trust us!
 Now all that’s left isthe wounded rabbit
 and the excellent pupil, huh?
 You two together,go to the next world.
 Take it back!
 Take it back!
 What’re you talking about?
 What you said…
 earlier!
 Don't mess…
 with the Uchiha…276	02:10:08:14	02:10:10:02with me!
 Why you--!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke! Get up!
 How very cold the bottomof the ocean must be.
 Stop!

 Sakura!
 Sakura!

 It’s been a while, hasn’t it, Naruto?Were you alone on a mission this time?
 I just went to deliverGrandma Tsunade’s letter…
 Is that so? Then you shouldreport to Lady Tsunade right away.
 I know!
 I’ve only been away for a week,
 but it seems as thoughan awful lot has changed.
 DOJO CHALLENGERS,COME THIS WAY		That sign wasn’t here before, either.
 Dojo challenge?
 MAKE-OUT VIOLENCE 3
 This way?
 This is a tight squeeze.
 Is that it?
 PASSION DOJO		“Passion Dojo.""		Who on earth built this?
 I’ve been waiting for you!
 Huh?
 You’ve come herefor a Dojo challenge, right?
 Well, then.Come at me from anywhere you like!
 Huh? Bushy Brow?
 If you don’t make a move,I’m coming at you!
 What? Wait, hold it.
 Hey, it’s me!lt’s only me, Bushy Brow!
 Naruto!
 Hey, that was close, I tell you!
 So the first Dojo challengerwill be you, Naruto!
 Well, I couldn’t wish fora better opponent!
 Huh?
 I’m going to go at this for real!
 W-Wait just a minute!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Here…
 So you just came to view the grounds?
 Then you should have said soin the first place.
 I never even got a chance to tell you.You just suddenly attacked me.
 I’m really sorry about that.
 Say. Is this Dojo yours, Bushy Brow?
 Yes. I have been working on itfor quite some time
 and finally completed it 6 days ago.
 This flyer was distributednot only in Hidden Leaf Village,
 but in all the nearbytowns and villages as well.
 You don’t say?
 I’ve been away on a missionand have only just returned…
 Is that so?
 But why a Dojo?
 It’s all for training.
 For training?
 Well, actually, I’ve been busywith missions lately
 and have not been able to set asideas much time for training as I’d like to.
 And even on those occasions whenI was able to take time out…
 it was difficult to find practice partners,so I wasn’t able to train efficiently.
 Just when I was wonderingwhat I ought to do about it
 YOUTH		I saw something in a village		I visited on a mission…
 I request a challenge!
 Please come this way.
 Okay…
 I have traveled near and farin search of training…
 I’d like to have a practice match.
 But if I should win,I’ll claim your marquee.
 A Dojo challenge, huh?Very well, I shall have a match with you.
 Here I come!
 If I were to open my own Dojo,
 someone with confidence in his skillswill surely come to challenge me!
 So, I opened the Dojo thinkingit would give me good practice,
 but nobody has cometo challenge me yet…
 Hmmm… Is that so?
 Say, since you’re here, Naruto,won’t you try out for a Dojo challenge?
 If you win,I’ll give you the sign I painted myself.
 I have no need for such things.
 Don’t say that!Please, by all means!
 C-Come to think of it,I forgot to report to Grandma Tsunade!
 I’d better go right away!
 See you later!
 Naruto!
 Please be my first!
 Damn it. I wasted so much timethanks to Bushy Brow.
 Grandma Tsunade scolded me to bits.
 I’d better steer clear of Bushy Brow’s Dojofor the time being.
 What’s that I hear about Lee’s Dojo?
 Intense Brow Sensei…?
 Naruto, what do you mean by that?
 Do you mean to tell methat he opened a Dojo to train himself
 while I was away from the villageon a mission?
 Splendid, if I may say soabout my own student!
 I, Might Guy, am impressed and moved!
 But the all-important Dojo challengersare yet to appear… Not a single one.
 Damn those Dojo challengers!
 To think that Lee’s earnest hopeshave come to naught…
 I’ll search high and lowand give them a hit they can not forget!
 But, if you do that,
 you’ll just make even less peoplewant to visit for a challenge.
 Ah, that’s right…Whatever shall I do then?!
 I’ve got it. If no one cometo challenge his Dojo, then…
 Why don’t I myself go to Lee’s Dojo,disguised as a Dojo challenger?
 I’ll play the part of Lee’s first!
 A perfect disguise, if I do say so myself.
 He wouldn’t dream thatthis was me, no way.
 Here I come, Lee.
 Guy Sensei!
 I finally found you.
 If it isn’t Sakura!What is going on?
 Guy, forgive me for bothering youwhen you’ve only just returned, but…
 an emergency relief request has come infrom Shikamaru’s squad,
 which was assigned totransport unit duty.
 We know nothing whatsoever aboutthe true nature and scale of the enemy.
 Therefore…
 there is a possibility of this developinginto something major
 if we err in our initial encounter.
 Judging from reports,they should be around here.
 They’re close by.
 First, you go reconnoiterto confirm the situation.
 If they seem to need additional relief,I will make immediate arrangements.
 Yes, roger that.
 Can that strange getuphave some significance?
 I don’t know…
 What’s with that strange fellow?
 Well, no matter.I’ll borrow his form
 to infiltrate Leaf Village.
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves’secrets…
 I, Nanafushi,shall investigate every last detail!
 Was that guy reallylooking for a Dojo challenge?
 Yeah. That’s what he claimed to be,so there can be no doubt.
 He says he camebecause he saw the flyers.
 I wonder if he got lost or something…
 Intense Brow Sensei, how longdo you intend to keep us waiting?
 Naruto, I think, after all, I’d liketo have you be a Dojo challenger…
 Oh no.
 I’ll go look for him!
 Naruto!
 Let’s work up a youthful sweat with me!
 Oh, he returned after all.
 I knew that get up would be problematic.
 What? 					What’s the problem?
 Huh?
 Sensei…?What’s with the strange disguise?
 Everyone can still tell it’s you!
 I…I didn’t think it wassuch a great idea, either.
 What’s the matter?
 Don’t tell me these guyshave discovered my true identify!
 Intense Brow Sensei!
 Sensei!
 Oh!
 Quit lollygaggingand get over to Lee's Dojo!
 Huh?!
 If you don’t go, then I’ll have to fight him!Come on!
 Be seeing you…!
 I guess you could say…
 That’s typical of him…
 I’m safe thanks to this guy…
 I should attach myself to him for a whileand scope out the situation in the village.
 What is this place?
 This is Lee’s Dojo!
 But, really… Couldn’t you havecome up with a little better disguise?
 Well, never mind!
 Lee must be tired of waiting,so try to do a good acting job!
 Acting?What is he talking about?
 I’ve brought him with me, Bushy Brow!
 I’ve been waiting for you…!
 Well then, please try to take down my Dojo!
 Huh…?
 Please come this way!
 Um…um.
 At time like this, you're supposed to say,“I request a challenge match,” right?
 I-I see…
 I-I request a challenge match!
 Do I hear that familiar call?You indeed are a Dojo challenger!
 Fair enough! If you win,you can have my marquee!
 Could it be that I’ve beenmistaken for a Dojo challenger?
 Oh my god…
 Huh?!
 He’s just a kid…
 Well, it can’t be helped.I’ll go easy on him…
 Okay! Here I come!
 – Ready! 					– Huh?
 He disappeared?
 Huh…?
 Wh-What happened…?
 This little brat…!
 Take that! And that!And this! And that!
 He's strong!
 What’s going on?!
 I know you’re only acting, but you’re stillgiving him too much of a break, Sensei.
 Oh, I see. He’s not fighting back becauseit’ll ruin his disguise!
 Even if I had nine lives,I’d never survive this fellow…
 I think I’d better wave a white flagand withdraw here.
 I-I concede…
 Then that means…I did it!
 I splendidly fought offmy first Dojo challenger!
 No, that’s not it at all!
 What he means by “concede”
 is that he concedesto be a Dojo challenger, right?
 In other words,he’s just been warming up,
 and now comesthe real challenge, right?
 No, that’s not it at all!
 So that's what you meant, after all…
 I thought it was odd that
 that an experienced Dojo challengerwould surrender.
 It’s not odd!There’s nothing odd about it at all!
 Well, then, I’ll have to reallyget down to business now, too!
 What?! You mean you haven’t evenreally gotten started yet?
 Hey! Intense Brow Senseiis a pretty good actor!
 He’s even taking more hits so thatBushy Brow won't know it's him.
 What?You were only attacked by monkeys?
 They were after the snacksthat Choji procured
 but the important load is safe!
 My snacks… by a monkey…
 Ino mistook that foran enemy’s attack
 and sent outan emergency relief request.
 But, it was so sudden!
 Anyway, it’s your faultfor procuring so many snacks!
 These snacks were availableonly for a limited time,
 and moreover,only available in the Land of Tea,
 the Super-rare“Green tea Pork-flavored” chips!
 For a lover of snacks, it is the ultimate sinto refrain from buying
 a limited offering of snacksonce one has found them!
 Like I care about stuff like that!
 What?
 What?!
 Shikamaru, things are tough for you,aren't they?
 Right back at you. That getup…Did something happen?
 Huh? What about my getup…?
 Here.
 Oh, that’s right!I haven’t got time for dallying here!
 I’ve got to get over to Lee’s dojo!
 Just wait for me, Lee!
 You’re overdoingon purposefully getting beaten, Sensei…
 Is he finished now?
 Whoa, hold it! Time out!
 Fight back a little, will you?!
 It’s impossible, I tell you.
 If Lee doesn’tfind this challenging enough,
 I might get stuck being his opponent.
 Actually…
 It’s been one extreme missionafter another lately,
 and I haven’t gotten any sleep at all…
 What? You don’t say…
 If I got a little rest,I think I might recover, but…
 While I take a rest,won’t you be his opponent for a while?
 What?!
 I’m begging you!
 Wh-What is that?
 I’m coming, Lee!
 G-Guy?
 I thought he already entered the villagea while ago…
 S-Sorry to keep you waiting!
 You've weathered such an attackand you're still undamaged…
 You’re quite a fellow!
 The world is vast…
 To think that suchan awesome Dojo challenger exists!
 It was worth building this Dojo!
 There’s no way I could winwith only Taijutsu!
 If that’s the case,then I’ll fight my own way…
 Here I come!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 But, of course! He’s well acquaintedwith Ninjutsu too!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 The real body is… right above me!
 Primary Lotus!
 Is this a clone, too?
 Got you!
 Here I go, one more time!
 Another Shadow Clone?
 Nope…!
 Stop it, Lee.
 S-Sakura?
 – Be nice, now!– Don’t be too hard on me.
 – Please! 					– Don’t be mean!
 So many Sakura…Guy Sensei! I’m moved!
 I’ve never known such happinessbefore in my life!
 – Cha! 					– Cha!
 Wha…?!
 We did it!
 I guess I forgot…that this is a fight with a challenger.
 Just as one might expect…But I won’t fall for the same trick again!
 Even though they may look like Sakura,they’re really just phony Transformation!
 How can you say that, Lee?
 Hurry back, Sensei!
 For brats,they fight such a high-level fight…
 – Leave it to Village Hidden in Leafs…– How about this?!
 I wonder if the rumors that
 – they lost its vigor were just lies?– In that case…
 – I guess I need to– Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 investigate this further…
 This disguise is problematic…
 I get a feelingI will be embroiled in trouble again.
 Let’s go with this.Well then, shall I be taking my leave?
 Hold it right there!
 The real thing!
 I see that you are Rock Lee,master of this Dojo.
 Oh no.I guess I’ll have to play along with him…
 Yes, indeed. I am Rock Lee,master of this dojo…
 I am a Dojo challenger!
 Rock Lee, I shall defeat youand claim your marquee!
 Here I come!
 You fight a pretty good fight.
 You, too…
 H-Help!
 B-Bushy Brow?!
 Dynamic Entry!
 A-Another Dojo challenger?!
 Intense Brow Sensei!What took you so long?!
 N-Naruto…what's the meaning of this?
 If you can’t dodgeeven this much of an attack,
 you are not worth all the talk!
 Your training is inadequate!
 N-No… This is… I mean…
 It’s about Million years too early for youto be building your own Dojo!
 I must straighten that spoiled attitudeof yours with my own fist!
 Forgive me Lee…lt’s my whip of love!
 So, the true identity of the challengerwas you, Guy Sensei!
 What? You’re Lee?Then, who was I punching?
 Who’s that guy?
 Good grief…
 Come in! 					Oh, it’s you, Guy…
 And you’re with Naruto and Lee.
 That’s perfect.I was just about to call you all.
 Has something happened?
 Just now, some intelligence came in…
 A Shinobi from the Land of Valleys,by the name of Nanafushi,
 is said to have been seekinginside information on our village.
 He may already haveinfiltrated the village.
 I want you to go search for this Nanafushiimmediately and capture him…
 Oh!
 That man…
 You have an idea of where he might be?
 – It’s this guy!– It’s this man!
 I don’t really know what’s going on…but our mission is complete!
 Well then, we’ll be going.
 Hey! Don’t just leave him here!
 Oh! Guy Sensei!
 Explain what happened!Hey! Lee! Hey! Naruto!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say,“Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!!Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stagedoes bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feelin my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s fromthat coke I just drank?
 In the small hours of the morningwhen the trees and grasses are asleep
 and the forest is deathly calm…
 A signpost standing forlornstarts telling of the destruction of a clan.
 Suddenly with a strike of thunder,heavy rain begins to fall down.
 What could be the true identityof the Iron Castle that appeared?!

 Sorry to have kept you waiting!Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!
 I’m not handing Gantetsu overto you, no matter what!
 That’s…
 It can’t be…!
 To Each His Own Path
 You… You mean you rippedthrough my net?!
 I can cut through a weak flimsy netlike that with a single bite!
 It’s useless! You won’t be able totear through my Mesh Cage!
 I’m gonna have Gantetsu back!
 I’m telling you, it’s useless!
 Damn it! I can’t get this thing off!
 Here, just die already!
 –Naruto! 					–Naruto!
 You’re mine!
 Too bad!
 So it’s you who’s gonna die,after all!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Go!
 This is the end for you!
 What’s that?!
 Shura, on the scene!
 The kid! The kid inside that netknows where the treasure is!
 Good job, Monju!
 Akio!
 Akio…?!
 –Akio! Bro! 					–Akio! Bro!
 Thank you.
 Gantetsu…
 I heard you say the name Akio,just now…
 Who in the world is that kid?
 That kid… Akio…
 He’s your…He’s your little brother.
 Th-That’s a lie!
 My younger brother…My younger brother has…
 In those flames…
 Akio…
 You…killed him…!
 No!
 Gantetsu hasn’t killed anybody!
 He rescued us! He rescued Akio!
 Five years ago.
 I had developed a distate forthe Ninja Dropout’s way…
 I found myself carrying Akio…
 Akio!
 Elder brother!
 No! You’ll inhale smoke!
 Damn it!
 I thought I could change a littleif I could only save that child.
 But that’s not what happened!
 I just continued to createvictims like Akio.
 So that’s why I started planningwhat’s happening right now
 in order to exterminatethe Ninja Dropouts.
 So that’s what happened…
 –Gantetsu!–Gantetsu, are you all right?
 You’re not hurt, are you?
 I’m glad you’re ok.
 They are children from the housesthat the Ninja Dropouts attacked…
 Using the money Gantetsu poachedfrom the gang,
 Akio, the oldest, has beentaking care of them.
 Gantetsu is just likethe central figure of a family.
 I can’t believe this…
 You mean that…the kid whowas there just now was…
 Akio!!
 Where are you going…Gantetsu?!
 To the Ninja Dropouts' hideout.
 I’m gonna get…Akio back!
 I will get Akio back! Your only jobis to guide me there!
 Don’t interfere!
 Todoroki, I understand how you feel.
 However, Gantetsu saved Akioand all these other kids
 from the Ninja Dropouts!
 Besides, there’s somethingyou should do before that!
 Don’t mess around with me!
 Even so, this guy…Gantetsu…is a member of the Ninja Dropouts.
 The Ninja Dropouts killed my parents!
 You’re absolutely right.
 My own crime will neverbe washed away.
 As soon as I get Akio back…you can…do whatever you like to me!
 I’m going, too!
 Me, too!
 Then, Sakura, please lookafter the children!
 Leave it to me!
 Todoroki…
 I’ve continued hating that guyfor five years…
 What am I supposed to do now…?
 Damn it!
 In any case, we’ve got to take careof your little brother right now!
 I know that!
 This time for sure…I’ll rescue Akio!
 Where did you stash our treasure?!
 Where’s your hideout?!
 Come on! Talk!
 I’ll never…tell you!
 You little brat!
 That’s the Ninja Dropouts’ hideout…
 That residence belongsto Shura, the leader.
 I’m pretty sure that’s where Akio will be.
 Akio…
 Oh! Hey! Todoroki! Wait!
 Damn!
 This ain’t good! They’ll detect us!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Let me handle this situation!
 I leave it to you, Bushy-Brows.
 Akio!
 This way.
 I’m pretty sure that Akio isbeing tortured in the basement…
 That guy was once a Ninja.
 There’s no telling whathe’ll try to do.
 I’ll go first.
 Akio!
 W-Wait!
 Akio…!
 Gantetsu…!
 You jerk…!
 Don’t come over here!
 Gantetsu!
 Akio!
 Hey! Gantetsu!
 So only one animal got caughtin the net, huh…?
 Shura!
 He’s one stubborn brat.He never unsealed his lips.
 I’ll use another method toget back the treasure.
 After I’ve killed the lot of you!
 Naruto, pursue Shura!
 We’ll be fine! Iron barslike this are nothing!
 Got it!
 Todoroki, I’m leaving thisin your hands!
 Farewell.
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 Todoroki, you take care of Akio!
 Todoroki!
 Blood Rain!
 I won’t forgive you…no matter what!
 Rasengan!
 So that’s what happened…
 Gantetsu…that’s how you protected Akio…
 Yet I… I…!
 Gantetsu! Give me Akio!
 Elder brother…you came to rescue me, after all…
 Hang in there, Akio!
 My elder brother…Todoroki, it's really you, isn't it?
 This spells the end of the Ninja Dropout.
 Yeah…
 That’s right.
 But where is Naruto?
 Hey!
 Naruto Uzumaki! On the scene…!
 Naruto! Lee!
 Akio!
 Akio’s back!
 It’s Akio…!
 Are you all right, Akio?!
 Yeah…
 Oh my gosh, you’re hurt!
 I’m fine. It’s nothing!
 Sakura, could youtake care of his wound?
 Leave it to me.
 Take care of him.
 Apologies for the inconvenience…Let’s head to the capital.
 I just cannot forgive you.
 But it is true that you rescued Akio.
 The Ninja Dropoutshave been annihilated.
 Gantetsu got caught upand died in the fighting
 that ensued while being escorted.
 Elder brother…
 Todoroki…
 Yeah! Great! That's great!
 You’re gonna stay here, right?
 Huh?
 You’re gonna stay here with Gantetsuand the other children, right?
 I haven’t been a good brother…
 But you are an irreplaceableelder brother for those children.
 Elder brother…
 What's this…?
 This is the souvenir that
 I didn’t have a chance togive you back then.
 Elder brother… Thank you.
 Let’s go! Ninja!
 Okay!
 –Good bye! 					–Good bye!
 –Take care, everyone!
 –See you!
 –Bye! 					–See you!
 Hey… How are we gonnaget out of this forest…
 without Gantetsu?!
 We can’t go back now!
 We took this path earlieron too, didn’t we…?
 I’m starving…
 I can’t go on.
 Hey! Somebody rescue us!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Naruto, what on earth were you thinking?
 What? I only brought an injured personto the hospital.
 But to bring an outsiderinto the village…
 But I’m sure he is not a bad guy at all.
 I understand your feelings,but he has amnesia.
 There is a possibility thathe’s an enemy spy.
 Please, Grandma.
 I’ll make an exception,just this one time.
 But you will be his keeper, and will beheld accountable for all his actions.
 That’s all.

 The Battle Begins:Naruto vs. Sasuke
 To be honest,I really don’t understand.
 It seems there were opinions that,
 with the final exam being suspended,
 no one should passthis time around.
 But I hear the late Third Hokagehighly praised your match.
 It seems he intended to recommend youfor Chunin.
 The lords of other landswho observed the fight
 and the proctors were ofthe same opinion as well…
 In that case, it’s not in my placeto say this or that about it.
 From now on,
 strive to perform in a mannerthat is worthy of that headband…
 Congratulations!As of today, you’re a Chunin!
 – Wow… 					– Wow!
 Even you who’s never motivatedlook respectable.
 It doesn’t suit you.
 Don’t laugh, I say…
 For the time being,
 let’s have a toast to celebrateShikamaru’s promotion to Chunin!
 Let’s eat!
 Oh! Choji!
 Don’t eat the meat before the toast!
 But, it’d be a waste if it got burned, so…
 There’s a lot of meat. Eat up!
 All right!
 Right now,I have no interest in you…
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 You’ll end up in the hospital again, Choji.
 Don’t you know how to savor the taste?
 Never mind!
 Even if I eat a lot,I know how to savor properly.
 Hey! Choji, that’s the last piece of meatthat I’ve been grilling!
 The last bite!
 This is the conclusion and
 will become the meat withthe greatest value that should be savored!
 I won’t hand overthis last bite to anyone!
 What’re you acting cool for,you idiot?!
 Everyone makes fun of youbecause you’re like this!
 – You’re just a fa--– Ino!
 That’s a taboo word!
 But really, Choji…
 A meal isn’t a battle.
 Relax at a time like this at least.What a pain.
 Vulgar... Dirty-mouthed…Too lazy…
 I wonder if these guyswill be okay from here.
 In particular…
 Choji. With you it’s nothing but food.
 Do a little training sometime!
 Choji…
 You’re lucky that your minddoesn’t restrict what you eat…
 I’ve got it rough with a diet.
 Why do you have to diet, Ino?
 Girls want to be seen as cute as possibleby the one they like!
 But that person might not alwayslike a thin person.
 In the first place,most boys don’t like fa--
 Not that… They like thin girls.
 And, vice-versa.
 You should be a little more consciousof your body, Choji.
 You won’t be popular.
 Heh… She doesn’t get it.
 Men don’t like thin womenas much as women think.
 More likely men who like chubby womenare the most common.
 And, vice-versa…I’d say.
 I bet she’d be twice as popular
 if she were to gain a little more weightinstead of dieting.
 You sure are a funny guy, Shikamaru.
 And you’re smart, too.
 Hmm?
 I know it in my heart…
 You’re much more awesomethan the likes of Sasuke or Neji.
 Well, I’ve never even thought about that.I’m me, so…
 But you’re the only onewho became a Chunin
 in the Chunin Exam this time…
 But you might be betterat fighting, right?
 I might’ve given up ifI’d gotten into one with you.
 But earlier,Sensei told me that all I do is eat
 and that I’m not progressing…
 I’m me, I tell you. And you’re you.
 It’s stupid talking about how which is.
 Well, don’t worry too muchabout what Asuma says…
 You should live naturallyand take things easy.
 See you later! I’m going home.
 My dad’s starting to saysome troublesome thing
 like he’s going to teach mea new Jutsu or something.
 Shikamaru.
 Hmm?
 What?
 Good luck with your training.
 Yeah.
 You’re a good guy…Choji.
 Hey, Sakura!
 Naruto!
 The time is right…
 Head for the Leaf Village, now!
 I see… You’ve made up your mind, huh?
 Yes!
 I’m carrying out fitness trainingto get ready for the surgery.
 I want to return as soon asI can after the surgery, so…
 Oww!
 Ow-ow…
 Lee…
 Yes?! What is it?
 You won’t dieif you give up being a Shinobi.
 Why are you so fixatedon being a Shinobi?
 My everything is proving thateven I can become a fine Ninja…
 You might die. Even if you succeed…
 Even so…
 I promise you!
 That’s my dream, so…
 Why…do you snap this muchat the mention of Hokage’s name?
 Unlike you…
 I will be the heir to the nameof Hokage, no matter what!
 Because, Hokage is my dream!
 In this village, promising childrenare being brought up.
 Sarutobi Sensei… Sure enough,you were a wonderful Hokage.
 The surgery is in the afternoon.Get ready!
 Let’s go, Lee! Are you prepared?!
 Yes!
 I got some apples…You like them, right?
 Here, doesn’t it look good?
 Huh…? I wonder where I put the knife…
 It’s right in front of you, believe it.
 It’s so lame, you getting all scatterbrainedjust because you’re in front of Sasuke.
 I’d rather hear lamefrom anyone but you…
 Naruto…
 U-zu-ma-ki!
 Naruto 2K Barrage!
 Knock it off already!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 I will…protect Sakura!
 I-I give up, believe it…
 Sasuke… Thank you.
 You rescued me fromthe Sand Ninja, right?
 No...
 The person who rescued you…was Naruto.
 You are weak.
 Why are you weak…?
 It’s because you don’t have enough…
 ...hate.
 Good. I peeled it nicely.
 I’ll cut it to make it easy to eat, and…
 Here, Sasuke.
 Ow! What happened?
 S-Sasuke?
 Huh? What’s going on?
 Wh-What?
 Y-You don’t have to glareat me like that.
 Hey, Naruto…
 Wh-What is it?
 Fight me… Right now!
 What?! Here you are,just treated by Old Lady Tsunade.
 What’re you saying?
 Just fight!
 Sasuke…
 You think you saved me?
 I don’t care if she’s the Fifth Hokageor whatever, but…
 she should’ve just mindedher own business!
 What?!
 You said you wanted to fight me, right?
 I’m saying let’s do it now!
 Or have you chickened out?
 S-Sasuke. Hey…What’s going on?!
 Naruto, you say something too!
 What’s this all of a sudden?
 This is perfect, believe it!
 I was just thinkingI wanted to fight you!
 S-Stop it, the both of you… Okay?
 Come with me!
 What’s…this feeling?My lower belly feels tight…
 I want to fight you, too.
 And… I feel a thrill.
 What’s so funny?
 Nothing’s funny, believe it!I’m happy!
 When I thinkI can finally beat you here!
 Abducting Naruto is the No.1 priorityof our organization, Akatsuki.
 What did you say?Don’t talk foolish, you failure!
 I’m not going to bea failure forever!
 Right now,I have no interest in you…
 You… A loser like you betternot act all high and mighty!
 Hah! It’s unlike you to loseyour cool and raise a fuss.
 So uncharacteristic.
 It couldn’t be that you picked a fightand then got scared, could it, Sasuke?
 Just bring it, now!
 Put on your headband before that!I’ll wait.
 I don’t need such a thing…
 Just do it!
 You wouldn’t even be able…to put one knick on my forehead!
 You’re wrong!
 I’m saying this is a testament to fightingon equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!
 And I’m saying stuff like thatis acting high and mighty!
 Do you think that we’re equal?!
 Yeah, I do! I’ve never oncethought that I’m inferior to you!
 You’re an eyesore!
 That’s because you remain weak!Little Sasuke!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Don’t be getting carried away!
 Naruto…
 Enough already, believe it!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 U-zu-ma-ki!
 Naruto Barrage!
 The Tiger Seal!
 Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!
 N-Naruto!
 Wh-What is that Jutsu?!
 Damn it!
 Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
 S-Stop…
 I’ll win no matter what!
 Don’t flatter yourself!
 Stop it, both of you…
 Stop it!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a personbroken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around (round around)
 Shake shake shakeLet’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 After becoming a Three-Man Squad,though we had fights,
 we carried out our missions together.
 And yet, both Sasuke and Narutohave steadily gone on ahead
 and only I've been left behind.
 Say, Sasuke, I feel you at a distanceeven though you're this close.
 No matter what,I can't see you, Sasuke.

39,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 The waves of pain are coming faster...
 Sasuke, you should quitthe preliminaries!
 Huh?!
 L-Look, you haven't been yourself
 ever since you got worked overby that Orochimaru guy!
 Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
 To think it’d be so soon…?!
 I couldn’t ask for more.
 For the 1st battle,
 Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchihahave been selected.
 No objections, right?
 - Right!-No!
 The pain won’t go away!
 It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
 Don’t use the Sharingan.
 So you knew?
 If that Curse Mark onyour neck gets out of control,
 it could endanger your life.
 I believe it.
 Well, the match will becalled off at that time.
 I’ll be coming in to stop it,so good luck.
 Called off, you say?!
 It seems this Curse Mark thingis responding to my Chakra.
 In other words, in this match,
 I can hardly use evenmy regular Jutsu,
 not to mention the Sharingan!
 However… Yoroi’s ability isthe worst for you, Sasuke.
 Now then, please begin.
 You… my Chakra…
 You just noticed now…?
 Bushy-Brow's Jealousy -Lions Barrage Unleashed!
 You… my Chakra…
 You just noticed now…?
 Yes…Yoroi has unorthodox abilityto absorb Chakra.
 It’s a magnificent art thatabsorbs spiritual and physical energy
 simply by holding his palm againstan opponent’s body.
 And, if all of your Chakrais absorbed, Sasuke,
 you’ll be forced to rely uponthe power of my Curse Mark…
 Now, release that luscious power…!
 That is the only wayyou have to survive.
 You…little!
 To think you still have strength left…
 Though you’re just a guinea pig.
 That was a close one…
 Put your mind at ease…I’ll end this right away!
 What’s the matter, what’s the matter?!
 You already finished?!
 His aim is one, close-quarter fight.
 What should I do!?
 At this rate, things will go downhill…
 Sasuke Uchiha…ls this the best you can do?
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke!
 You call yourself an Uchiha with that?
 Don’t be looking so lame!
 Give your best!
 That guy…
 That’s it!
 Oh!
 You can’t afford to be inattentive!
 I’ll finish you with this!
 Is this as far as it goes…?
 He…vanished?!
 That’s my…!
 What?!
 Huh?
 But then…from here on is my original.
 It’s over…
 The Dancing Leaf Shadow…?!
 Eat this!
 Dang it…!lt’s responding every time…
 Please…!
 I’m begging you…
 Stop!
 You! Sasuke!Don’t be looking so lame!
 To think they’d be worried about me…
 Is this it…?
 I won’t be swallowed up…by this thing...
 No way!
 The Curse Mark receded!?
 Here I go!
 You’re weak!
 You’re weak.
 I’m not done, yet!
 Lions Barrage!
 There’s no need to check.
 I’m stopping the match fromgoing any further…
 Therefore, the winner of thefirst battle, Sasuke Uchiha…
 passes the preliminaries!
 Yes!
 Well. Good job…
 Before that Lions Barrage,
 your movements were thatof Guy’s Taijutsu…
 So you copied it with the Sharingan
 when you wrangled that one timewith that Lee kid?
 Sasuke! You, you…
 won in a lame way!
 Look at you, all battered up!You idiot!
 Man, that loser…
 Sasuke…Thank goodness.
 Okay, I’ll win, too!
 Lee… Because of you, I’ve managed to save my neck.
 Things would’ve gotten hairy
 if I hadn’t seen your techniquein close-quarters combat.
 But it doesn’t appear to be a techniquethat I can use heavily.
 I see… So before, he copied a partof the technique I only used once?
 Sharingan!
 That’s your ability…
 Sasuke… you’re quite a person.
 You get rapidly stronger…
 I kind of…feel a bit of fear.
 For a sequence ofhigh-speed Taijutsu Lotus movements,
 it’s impossible to acquire thiswithout training
 that whittles away flesh and blood.
 No matter how much youuse the Sharingan,
 it can’t just be mastered ina short space of time…
 Moreover, his idea for thatfinishing move…
 Kakashi… this boy reminds meof when you were a kid…
 Last year’s number one rookiewas Neji Hyuga.
 This year’s number one rookieis Sasuke Uchiha.
 I wonder which one is stronger…?
 Really, he’s something else.
 To think he’d develop the true powerof the Sharingan in situation like this…
 What’s most to be feared…is the Uchiha ability?
 That was surprising…
 To think he brought the Curse Markthat was getting out of control
 into submission with his will…
 Tsk. Again?
 It just make it more interesting!
 Yeah! He is Sasuke after all…
 This is as far as we’ll go…
 I’m hungry…
 W-Wow!
 Nothing special.
 Magnificent…
 Sasuke Uchiha...
 We medics will give youthe best of treatment.
 You guys are out of your territory.
 Huh?!
 I’ll take him under my care…
 Now, I’ll take you into the back…
 and seal the Curse Mark.
 Can we wait untilthe preliminaries are over?!
 I want to watch the matchesof those who will remain in the main battle.
 No!
 Don’t get so heated.
 If we let things beany further,
 the situation might become irrevocable.
 I won’t accommodate you anymore.
 Now then, come on…
 Sasuke…
 Hm?
 Sakura... Speaking of which,during the match…
 did you see something that lookedlike a strange wound on Sasuke’s neck?
 What?
 Please promise me…
 Don’t say anything aboutthis bruise to Naruto.
 What?
 Listen… this is also teamwork.
 It won’t do to have himunnecessarily worried.
 I-I don’t know either.
 I see…
 Umm, now then…
 We will get right to it andbegin the second match.
 Abumi Zaku vs. Shino Aburame
 Which weakling is it?!
 Both of you, come forward.
 We will now begin the second match.
 That’s the Sound Ninja…
 The guy who had bothhis arms broken by Sasuke!
 It seems like you’re proudof your arms…
 You!
 S-Stop it!
 He’s going to fight with those arms?
 I wonder if Shino is going to be okay…
 He’s fine. He’s strong!
 What…?
 I’d square off with anybody except him…
 Now then, please begin.
 Now, Zaku…
 How you fight will be a sight to see…
 If you fight here,you’ll be finished…
 Withdraw!
 Somehow, this one still works, so…
 One arm is enough to take care of you!
 You can’t beat me withjust one arm.
 Stop pestering me!
 Take this!
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 Okay.
 Hang in there.lt’ll be over right away.
 Curse Sealing!
 Next time, even if that Curse Markstarts kicking in again…
 the power of this Curse Sealingshould suppress it.
 However, this Sealing Jutsu makesthe strength of your will its foundation.
 If something happens likeyou not believing in your own strength
 and that will were to weaken…
 the Curse Mark willonce again start to rage.
 Out of character.
 It appears he’s quite tired…
 To think you’ve become able tohandle Sealing Jutsu…
 You’ve grown, eh, Kakashi…?
 You…
 Long time no see, Kakashi.
 Orochimaru…
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 This is surprising.
 I never thought you’d appear.
 Why are you after Sasuke?What’s your purpose?!
 Even though you’re one ofthe legendary three Ninja,
 I must not retreat.
 I’ll stop you here,even if it costs my life!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way

 Rockin' my heart

 We should be too!
 The Weapon Known 					as Shinobi
 Old man!
 Old Man Giichi!
 Please open up!
 Let's go to the bridge!
 If we all do it together,
 we can beat Gatô andhis men this time!
 Inari…
 I made up my mind notto fight anymore.
 Even your father…
 The man we called a hero…
 He's not with us anymore.
 If we were to fight,many lives would be lost.
 I don't want lose something that'sspecial to me anymore.
 No one wants to regret again.
 I…
 I don't want to regret again, either.
 That's why we must fight!
 A man should livehis life without regrets.
 I love Mommy and Grampa.
 And you too, Old Man Giichi!
 I love all the people here!
 I finally realized…
 Nothing is accomplished ifI just cry all the time!
 I finally got it!
 Inari…has grown intoa fine man.
 Will you just let Inari gothere by himself?
 Open up!
 Hey!
 I'm asking you to fight with me!
 Old man! Please listen to me!
 Why…
 Why won't anyone openthe door to me?
 You are strong!
 Naruto…
 Zabuza.
 You were too full of yourself.
 You're too ambitious for your own good.
 You assassinated the Mizukage,but failed to pull off a coup.
 You left the service withfew men under you,
 and became a Rogue Ninja.
 Soon after, your name reachedour Hidden Leaf Village.
 You needed to raise fundsto strike back.
 And you needed to hide
 from the Tracking Unit'spursuit and retaliation.
 Isn't that about the reason why
 you hired yourself outto scum like Gatô?
 Zabuza…
 Do you really believe I've managedto survive with just Sharingan?
 Here's something I didn't copy,a technique of my own…
 to enlighten you!
 Lightning Blade!
 What the…?!
 His hand is…visibly overflowing with Chakra!
 You are too dangerous.
 Tazuna, the man you are tryingto assassinate,
 is the symbol of couragein this land!
 The bridge he is buildingis the hope of this land!
 And your ambitions willsacrifice countless lives.
 That isn't howa Shinobi is supposed to behave.
 Who cares?
 I have always fought formy own ideals.
 And that will never ever change!
 I'll say it again.
 Huh?
 Give up.
 Your future is…death!
 Naruto…
 I want you to kill me.
 Please, make it quick.
 What are you hesitating for?
 I just don't get it!
 The only reason you are allowedto live is because you stay strong?
 There must be something otherthan just fighting…
 There must be some other way
 for you to makethe others accept you!
 Remember when we met at the forest?Do you know what I thought?
 That you and I are much alike.
 I'm sure you can relate to me.
 I apologize for dirtyingyour hands with my blood.
 Is that it?
 Is there really no other way?
 No.
 If only…we had met underdifferent circumstances,
 we could've been friends.
 Please…promise you willgrasp your dream.
 He too…
 Sasuke also had dreams of his own!
 Thank you…You will become stronger.
 Hmm…
 The super thick foghas finally begun to clear.
 There are two over there!
 They are facing off each other.
 Huh?
 I can't see well…
 Which one is Kakashi Sensei…
 One moved!
 Huh?
 Forgive me, Naruto…
 I cannot die yet!
 Is this the end…?
 What was that?
 Zabuza…
 Did you say my futurewas death?
 You're off the mark again, Kakashi!
 No…
 You're not to go to the bridge alone!
 I went all over the town,but no one wants to come.
 I have no choice!
 But…
 Wait! 					You're just a child!
 I may be a child, but I alreadyknow what it means to fight.
 Because I'm my father's son!
 My dear…
 Wait a moment, Inari!
 Where did he go…?
 I didn't notice,but the fog is starting to lift…
 Huh? Is he over there?
 Huh?!
 What the heck is going on here?!
 Isn't that the masked boy?
 I didn't expect him to jump into save Zabuza…
 The boy…is already dead.
 You did great, Haku.
 Kakashi Sensei!
 He intends to slash mealong with the boy?!
 That was really a great find I made!
 Even in his final moment,
 he gave me sucha perfect opportunity!
 Haku, bad news.
 I have to leaveLand of Water as of tonight.
 However, I'll returnto this land someday.
 I will rule over this land.
 To do that,
 what I need isn't consolation,encouragement or empty words.
 What I really need is…
 I already know.
 You have nothing to fear.
 I am your weapon, Zabuza.
 Keep me by you as a mere toolthat heeds your every word.
 You're a good boy!
 Haku died and you wereable to move, huh?
 I won't forgive you!
 Naruto!
 You just stay there and watch!
 This is...
 my battle!
 Naruto…
 Naruto!lt's good to see you!
 Sakura…
 Where's Sasuke?
 Naruto! 					Where is Sasuke?
 Sakura…
 Kakashi!
 You have no time to takeyour eyes off me!
 Why don't I go with you?
 That way, you won't be goingagainst your Sensei's word.
 Right…
 Sasuke…
 Huh?!
 He's cold.
 This isn't Genjutsu, is it?
 Don't mind me.
 This isn't the time tohold back your emotions…
 I-I always got perfect scoresat the Ninja Academy…
 Huh?
 I memorized all thehundreds of Shinobi rules.
 All the tests were a breeze.
 Until one day,this question came up…
 State Rule ♪ 25 ofthe Ways of the Shinobi…
 As always, I simply wrote downthe answer without batting an eye.
 ""A Shinobi must nevershow his true feelings
 under any circumstances,no matter what…
 The mission always comes first.
 A Ninja must have the strengthof character never to shed any tears…""
 Is this..how it must be for a Shinobi?
 That is so unbearably painful…
 Sasuke…
 Why…? 					Why can't I keep up?
 Darn you!
 Why you…!
 You can't possibly defeat methe way you are now.
 What was that?
 You still don't know…What true strength means!
 Let's see how things are going…
 Goodbye, Demon!
 Both your arms havenow been disabled.
 You can't even weave a sign.
 Huh?
 Oh!You really got it this time.
 You disappoint me, Zabuza.
 Huh?! You!
 What the heckare you doing?!
 Don't you have anythingto say, Zabuza?!
 He was your comrade, right?!
 You were always,always together, weren't you?
 He really liked you, you know!
 You really don't feel anything?!

 The bridge should be visible soon.
 When we reach the side of the bridge,we'll be in the Land of the Waves.
 Wooow! 					 It's huge!
 H-Hey! 					Please keep it down.
 I took this boat out under cover of fog.
 And I cut the engineand am rowing by hand.
 If they find us,we'll be in deep trouble.
 Mr. Tazuna.
 I want to ask you somethingbefore we arrive at the pier.
 The identity of your assailants,and the reason why they are after you.
 If you don't tell us…
 our mission may endwhen you make landfall.
 The Assassin of the Mist
 It appears I have no choicebut to tell you.
 Frankly, I'd like you to listen.
 Just as you said,
 this may be beyondthe scope of your mission.
 Actually, I am being targetedby a terrifying man.
 A terrifying man?
 Who?
 You guys have probably heard at least his name before.
 A shipping magnateby the name of Gato.
 What? Gato…of the Gato Company?
 One of the world's richest men?
 Who? What?
 Yes…
 On the surface, he's the chief executiveof a shipping company…
 But underneath,he is into drug-trafficking
 and deals in contrabandusing gangs and Ninjas.
 Moreover, he runs a despicable business,
 ruthlessly taking over nationsand enterprises.
 It was about one year ago…
 when that man first set his eyes onthe Land of the Waves…
 He used his wealth and violenceto enter this country,
 and before anyone knew it,
 he had taken complete control of the island'smaritime transportation and shipping.
 Having a tight grip on the ocean, in anisland nation like the Land of the Waves,
 means having control of finance,the government, the people... everything.
 The one thing Gato fears...
 is the completion of the bridge...
 that has been under constructionfor some time now.
 I see.
 Since you're the one building the bridge,you've become a hindrance.
 Then, those Ninjas from beforewere Gato's men…?
 But I don't understand.
 Your opponent is a dangerous one, who will even use Ninja.
 Why did you hide that fact from uswhen you made your request?
 The Land of the Waves…
 is a very poor nation,and even feudal lords have no money.
 Of course, we ordinary citizenshave no money either.
 We cannot afford to make requests ofRank B or higher...
 Well, if you pull outof the mission when I land ashore,
 I will, no doubt, be killed.
 Killed sometime before I make it home.
 But there's no need for concern!
 Should I die, my cute grandchildwho will turn eight...
 will only cry his heart out!
 Oh!
 And... my daughter will only blamethe Hidden Leaves Ninja
 for the rest of her lifeand grieve in solitude!
 Oh, it's not your fault at all!
 Well...
 I guess we have no choice.
 Let's continue as his bodyguards.
 Oh! I am most grateful!
 I won!
 We'll be arriving soon.
 Tazuna.
 It appears we haven't been noticedup until this point…
 Thanks.
 This is as far as I go.
 See you around.
 Yeah. You've been a big help.
 Be careful.
 Okay!
 Get me home safely.
 Right.
 When they next attack,it won't be Chunin, but elite level Jonin.
 Cripes!
 I won't let this guy doall the fun stuff anymore!
 There!
 Heh… Just a mouse.
 Quit trying to show off!
 There was nothing there in the first place!
 Please, Naruto.
 Don't use Kunai Knives recklessly.
 They're really dangerous.
 Hey brat!Don't be doing anything confusing!
 Huh? I sense a presence there!
 No, over here?!
 There!
 Stop it, already!
 S-Someone's really been targeting us the whole time!
 Yeah right!
 Knock it off, you!
 Naruto!What have you done?!
 It's a bunny!
 I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to…I'm sorry, bunny.
 It's just a rabbit, eh.
 That's a snow rabbit.
 But that doesn't explainits fur color...
 The coat turns white only during winterwhen there is little sunlight.
 Which means...
 that snow rabbit was raised indoorswithout sunlight to be used as a substitution.
 Guess they're already here…
 I'm sorry…
 I see… The Demon Brothers wouldn'tbe enough to take on these guys.
 The Copy Ninja from theVillage of the Hidden Leaves.
 ""Sharingan"" Kakashi is with them…
 Everyone, get down!
 If I'm not mistaken, he's…
 Here we go!
 Here we go, here we go,here we go!
 I'm going to do it this time.
 I won't lose to Sasuke!
 Well, well.
 If it isn't the Rogue Ninjaof the Hidden Mist, Zabuza Momochi!
 Rogue Ninja? Whatever.What's important now is…
 Ready…
 Go!
 You're in the way.
 Get back, you guys.
 Why?!
 He's on a totally different level fromthe guys from the other day.
 His being our opponent means…
 Huh?
 Oh.
 that things might be trickyas I am now.
 I assume you are Kakashi,the Sharingan user…
 Sorry, but…
 I'll have you hand over the old man.
 Huh? Huh? Sharingan?What's that?
 What? What is he talking about?
 Is this guy strong?
 Sharingan…
 Get in Manji battle formation, you guys.
 Protect Tazuna…
 Don't involve yourselves in the fight.
 Huh?
 That's the teamworkin this situation.
 Huh?!
 Fight me.
 W-What's this eye…?
 Well now...
 I never expected to seethe rumored Sharingan this soon…
 This is an honor.
 Everyone's been saying Sharingan...
 What is it?!
 …Sharingan.
 Power that the light of the eye generates,and the pupil emanates.

 is said to possess the vision to see throughall Genjutsu (Illusionary Art),
 Taijutsu (Physical Art),and Ninjutsu (Ninja Art),
 and is able to deflect them.
 The Sharingan is a type of eyethat is unique
 to the user of the Visual Art.
 However, that is not the only power ofthe Sharingan.
 Well said.
 That is not all.
 What's more frightening is thatsuch an eye
 can assess an opponent's techniquesand copy them.
 When I was in the Anbu Black Opsof the Hidden Mist,
 search informationabout you was in the Bingo Book
 I would carry around with me.
 There was also somethingelse in the book...
 About the man who has copiedover one thousand skills…
 Kakashi the Copy Ninja.
 What? Kakashi Senseiis that incredible a Ninja?
 W-Wow!
 What does this mean?
 The Sharingan…is a special trait
 that appears in only a select feweven among the Uchiha clan.
 Could it be, that this guy…
 Let's end the talking here.
 I must kill that old man immediately.
 But, Kakashi, it seemsI have to defeat you first.
 Over there!
 And he's even on the water?
 He's building up quite a bit of Chakra!
 Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu.
 He's vanished?!
 Sensei!
 He'll probably come to erase me first…
 What is he?
 Zabuza Momochi.
 He's a Anbu Black Ops memberin the Hidden Mist and
 is known as ""the silent killing""technique expert.
 S-Silen...?
 As the name suggests…
 it's a killing skill that's implementedin an instant in silence.
 By the time you realize it,
 it's possible you may find yourselfin the afterlife.
 I haven't totally masteredthe use of my Sharingan.
 So don't lower your guard, you guys.
 Well, if we fail, we'll only die.
 How can you be so carefree?!
 The mist is steadily getting thicker!
 The Land of the Wavesis surrounded by ocean.
 So mist rises very easily.
 Sensei!
 Eight spots.
 Huh? What?
 The larynx, the spine,the lungs, the liver...
 The jugular and the subclavian veins.
 The kidneys, the heart.
 Now then, which vulnerable spotwould be good?
 What an intense thirst for blood!
 If I take even one breath,or move my eyes,
 I will be marked and killed -that's what I'm feeling.
 If I'm stuck like this for an hour,I'll go mad!
 Facing a Jonin's intent to kill…
 This sensation is like havingmy life being held in limbo…
 No way! I'd rather dieto escape this feeling!
 Sasuke.
 Don't worry.I'll protect you with my life.
 I will not allowmy comrades to get killed.
 I wonder about that...
 It's over.
 Sensei! 					Behind you!
 Die!
 The Water Clone Jutsu?
 It can't be!
 In this mist…
 did he actually copy me?
 Don't move.
 It's over.
 O-Oh no!
 Even Kakashi Sensei fell underZabuza's Jutsu.
 I've got to escape.
 I'll get killed, for real.
 This pain.
 What am I doing?!
 I'd decided, hadn't I?Not to run away no matter what happens.
 Next episode: ""The Oath of Pain!""
 I'm going to kick butt once again!

 Summoning Jutsu!
 This time for sure, the frog will…
 What’s a frog anyway?!
 From which stage do youcall it a frog?!
 Live or Die:Risk it All to Win it All!
 Hey! Hold up a hopeon me a bit, would you?!
 Whew… he collapsed again…
 That’s no surprise…
 For three weeks, he’s continuedhis training on guts alone…
 Lord Hokage.
 Anko, is it…?
 I’m sorry, I’m...
 Regretting returning alivefrom the Forest of Death?
 That’s a needless thing because you andOrochimaru have no connection at all.
 There is no Shinobi who can competeagainst that guy in Hidden Leaf Village.
 Even if I was the one to face him…
 If the Fourth Hokage were still alive…
 Don’t say that.
 He already saved this village and died…
 That’s a story from 13 years ago.He’s no longer here.
 We have to do somethingwith our power.
 Yes.
 I’m going to get some fesh air…
 Don’t blame yourself.
 C’mon, open your eyes already.
 W-What’s that…?
 To be clear, you have no sense.
 Oh! Pervy Sage!
 After you’ve been training for 3 weeks,you are still this level.
 If you continue like this it’s pointless.
 That’s not how it is!I’m doing this with all my might!
 I understand that, if you really wantto succeed at Summoning Jutsu,
 you have to do it like you’re goingto die or it’s no good at all.
 That’s what I’m doing!
 I drill my Chakra every daylike I’m going to die.
 If you have time to complain about it,teach me a trick or something!
 A trick, huh… A trick.
 What?! You’re going to teach me?
 You need to risk your life on it.
 L-Life…?
 It’s not a joke.Even so, will you do it?
 O-Of course!I always risk my life!
 I see…
 Huh…?
 Well then, follow me.
 What are we doing at a place like this?
 You’re not gonna peek again,are you?
 Well, that would be nice,but today it’s a bath.
 First, we purify our bodies…
 Huh?
 There’s something strange going on…
 This is such a nice bath.
 Like heaven… Truly heavenly…
 Hey, Pervy Sage.
 I’m Toad Sage.
 Whatever, but how are takinga bath and Summoning related?
 Hey, hey, hey, hey--!
 What is it?!
 Hey, Naruto.
 Huh?
 Is there something you want to eat?
 I’m going to eat!
 It’s good! If the training is like this,I’ll do it every day!
 Eat up! Because this is the last…
 Huh?
 No, nothing. Anyway, eat!Eat a lot!
 Like there’s no looking back!
 I don’t know what’s going on,but I should eat, right? Okay!
 Seconds! The next one is miso flavor too!
 Gotcha!
 One more!
 Coming right up!
 This time miso char siu!
 Yeah!
 I ate, I ate.
 Thank you, Pervy Sage…
 What?!
 Thanks for your patronage!
 I won’t even get blood from it…
 Yo, are you full?
 Don’t mess with me, Pervy Sage!
 Weren’t you treating mewith the meal!
 Fool! Who said thatI was treating you?!
 Aren’t you a grown-up?! Bastard!
 By the by, Naruto,isn’t there a girl that you like?
 Huh?
 I asked if you have a lovely girl?
 Well…you could say she’s there,you could say I like her…
 You could say it’s Sakura.
 So there is?
 It’s Sakura!
 Okay! Then go andhug that girl tight!
 What?!
 Is that a part of the training?
 Well, close enough.
 Okay! Right away…
 But if I do that, Sakura will…
 No! This is training too!I have to do it or I won’t be strong…
 But if I do that, Sakura will…
 For a while she won’t talk to me…
 No! If I’m going to masterSummoning Jutsu,
 this can’t be helped!
 But…Sakura will…
 No! But…
 Hurry up and go!
 What do you want?
 No, uh…well…
 If it’s money you want,I won’t lend it to you.
 I may not look it,but I’m stingy with money.
 No, that’s not it…
 Well…
 Uh, if I tell her it’s for my training,she’s sure to beat me.
 If there’s nothing you want,then I ’ll go home.
 W-Wait a minute!
 Oh…
 This is it!This is my chance!
 Sakura! I’m sorry!
 Hey!
 What are you doing?!
 Cha!
 Ow… Ouch…
 This is a part of being young…
 Hey, if I do this I’ll really get a frog?
 Yes, that’s a definite.
 Really…?
 Is there anything you’ve left undone?
 Huh?
 None?
 What are you talking about…?
 To pull out enormous Chakraand use it.
 It is certain that it is difficultto have the control to do it…
 It is also certain that this bodyis a vessel too small
 to absorb the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra…
 It’s likely that Naruto’s body normallytends to reject
 the strength of the Nine-Tailed Foxin order to avoid too much strain.
 If the excitement of danger andemotion are the key
 to drawing out theNine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra…
 he has to learn physically untilhe can automatically use that key.
 Nothing personal…Fourth Hokage!
 Huh? Where…is this…?
 Stand up!
 W-What’s going on?!
 Your training ends here.
 Huh? I haven’t done anything yet…!
 Naruto!
 Go die and come back.
 Die?
 From within the dreadfulness of death,squeeze out enormous Chakra!
 Experience it with your own body,and grasp the technique of it!
 If you don’t want to die,do something about it yourself… Got it?
 Now…we’ll see if the strength givento you is really yours.
 If I don’t grab onto this… I’ll die!
 Now!
 It’s impossible…
 This rock surface is slipperyfrom the seepage of the waterfall.
 Besides, falling in that speedwith the control of Chakra that you have,
 you can’t cling to the rock.
 Naruto, after this…
 you can only depend onthe Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox.
 Open up the key…This time from your side!
 If I go on like this!lf I go on like this! I’ll seriously die!
 Die!
 Die…
 Today, we’ll havea history lesson outside.
 As you know, this rock face hasthe faces of the Hokage line.
 In order from the left,they’re lined up fom the First,
 the Second…the Third…and the Fourth.
 So different from the present old man.
 Especially the receding hairline…
 Iruka Sensei! Who’s the Fifth?
 Hmm?
 Well, that hasn’t been decided yet…
 Perhaps it’s your teacher here!
 Hmm… Weaving an occasional joketo make for a relaxing lesson, Iruka?
 L-Lord Hokage!
 Oh, it’s the Third.
 Hey! Old man!What did you come to do?
 I wanted to see the rock faces too.
 You’ve come at a good time.Over this way, my lord.
 This is the real man ofthe third rock face!
 The Third Hokage!
 The third was called the strongest,a genius,
 called “professor” amongpast Hokage!
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 Hey! Iruka, don’t say itin the past tense.
 S-Sorry.
 Are you really strong?
 Yeah, you don’t look it!
 Yep! That’s right!
 Enough!
 To take over the name of Hokagemeans you’re the strongest in this village!
 Okay! I’m going to becomethe Fifth Hokage!
 After all I’m really strong,and handsome too!
 It won’t work withthe scores you have now!
 You’ve got a lot of confidence!
 You all are quite young,unlike me!
 There might be someone who willtake the name of Hokage is in this group.
 You only have one life!
 Don’t choose an impossible road.
 It doesn’t matter if you live asyou like and die as you like.
 However…
 no matter what route you take,
 remember to protect thepeople important to you!
 Important people?
 That you acknowledge…trust and love from your heart.
 Do you have people like that?
 Y-Yeah… Dad and Mom…
 and I hate him a little,but my big brother too.
 And… 					my dog Gonta…
 For me, it’s friends!
 Me too!
 Lord Hokage, you havepeople like that too?
 Yes, of course I do!
 Really! Who, who?
 I have my grandchild…Konohamaru over there and…
 All of the people in this village!
 Like you did too, once…
 Huh?!
 This feeling… It’s that Chakra…
 This is…
 Seal
 I-It’s huge… What is it?
 Hey kid, come closer!
 I want to eat and kill you,but this gate won’t open…
 Bloody spell that seals…
 You're…
 the Nine-Tailed Fox!
 I see… the red Chakrawas this guy’s Chakra.
 For you to approach me…
 What business brought you here?
 Hey! You stupid fox!
 Since you’re staying in my body,as your rent, lend me your Chakra!
 After all, if you die I die.
 That’s some impressive couragefor threatening me!
 That’s fine…
 As a reward for making it this far…I’ll give it to you!
 This is the feeling!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Well done.
 Where am I?!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

 It seems that the most bustling traveler’stown in the Land of Rice Paddies
 is at the bottom of these mountains.
 You’re going to weird places again
 in the name of investigation,aren’t you, Pervy Sage?!
 Please stop it already!
 We had a rough time shakingoff the bodyguards from the rip-off bar.
 I understand your point,
 but there’s no other way to findVillage Hidden in the Sound.
 Gee, I don’t like it either, but…
 This is truly a problem…
 But we have to do thingswe don’t like… Right?!
 Okay, let’s go!
 Naruto, Sakura,don’t drag your feet!
 Investigation, investigation!What a pain.
 He looks like he’s having fun.
 He hasn’t learned at all.
 Fuma Alley
 – Oww! 					– That's my line!
 This is even rougher thanthe traveler’s town before.
 Let’s just take a pass on this placeand find Village Hidden in the Sound.
 Say…
 I don’t have any more money.
 I don’t have any more money either!
 Here!
 You guys go get some food with that
 and wait in the templeon the outskirts of town.
 Information accumulatesin this kind of place,
 but it’s not good for you guys to see.
 I’ll sacrifice myself and check it out.
 He’s a surprisingly nice person…
 Sakura… You’re still so naïve.
 Where should I investigate first?
 Gee, how rough…lnvestigations are painful.
 Let’s leave the Pervy Sage beand check somewhere else.
 What’s the matter, Sakura?
 I don’t think…Sasuke’s in this land anymore.
 What’s the matter?!
 We won’t know that ifwe don’t investigate!
 Yeah, but…
 Our opponent is Orochimaru.
 Of course, things might not go easily.
 But you know…
 But I’m sure we’ll find him!
 Right.
 Naruto!
 You’re…the one from before?!
 This kid’s…hurt…
 You…?
 Naruto!
 Substitution, huh…?
 We let them get away.
 Don’t worry…
 My cute childrenare making a silver trail for us.
 They can’t escape from us now…
 It seems those two arepetty Ninja from somewhere.
 But getting involved with ushas sealed their fate.
 It’s unfortunate for them…
 The objective of those who sneak intothis land is Lord Orochimaru, anyway.
 Sure enough, the skin ofa young woman is supple.
 You’re mean!
 Eh? Oh, sorry sorry.
 By the way, have you guys heardrumors about the Sound Village?
 The Sound Village?
 I’ve never heard the nameof such a village.
 I’ll tip you handsomely if you tell me.
 But I really don’t know.
 I’ve never heard of it.
 I’ve heard of it!
 One of my regulars knowsa lot about it.
 Wanna come?
 Yeah.
 His home is in the back of this alley.
 Trapped like a rat.
 What, it’s a seedy old man!Hey! He’s got money, right?
 Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.
 You punks! Stop the idle chatterand take care of him now!
 Right, boss!
 Getting infatuated with girls has sealedyour fate! Rest in peace!
 Ninja Art: 					Needle Jizo.
 You punk…
 I’m in a hurry…
 I think it’d be best if youanswer compliantly
 whether or not you knowabout Hidden Sound Village.
 You’re a fool if I look likea compliant person to you!
 You a Ninja?
 If so?
 Interesting!
 We’ve reduced ourselves tobeing thieves,
 but we’re a somewhatfamous Shinobi clan around here!
 Instead of taking your life,I could hire you if you want!
 A Ninja, huh…
 Then I don’t need to go easy on you.
 Don’t be acting like a big shot, old man!
 Shut up, you squirt!
 A Ninja refers to one who endures.
 Those who couldn’t enduretheir hunger pangs
 and resort to use their diligentlystudied Jutsu for stealing
 are not called Ninja!
 I won’t let that pass!
 Thinking we’re fellow Shinobi,we took pity on you.
 Acting all conceited!
 Regret after being sliced in two!

 You punk! How dare youdo that to the boss!
 We won’t let you doany more than that!

 I sense you must bea person of stature!
 If it’s all right,may I ask you your name?
 If you don’t know, then I shall tell you!
 Women become infatuatedwith his sex appeal.
 He’s strong against Shinobi,but has a soft spot for women!
 He exists in Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 And made his name known…
 Master Jiraiya, that’s me!

 You guys bow your headsand beg for your lives!
 We’ll all be killed!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Although we didn’t know,being so rude to Master Jiraiya,
 reputed as one of the LegendarySannin of the Leaf Village!
 We beg for your forgiveness!
 So my name’s known in this land, too…
 Well, it’s okay.
 So is it true that you know aboutVillage Hidden in the Sound?
 Yes! There were many Ninja clansin the Land of Rice Paddies,
 including us Fuma.
 We divided up the rolesamongst ourselves
 and the Ninja of this landwere doing well in their own way.
 Until that man appeared…
 Who was that man?
 It’s regrettable to even speakof that name…
 It was Orochimaru!
 It’s okay! Rest easy!
 If germs get into the woundand you get tetanus,
 you won’t be saved.
 But fortunately, I have medicine,so let me treat you.
 They’re not coming.
 Just show us your wound.
 Well, huh?
 Naruto, go wait outsidetill my treatment is done.164.01	01:37:53:04	01:37:53:24	Huh?
 Why do I have to bethe only one chased out?!
 Jeez!
 I guess it can’t be helped.
 Don’t peek!
 I know.
 Okay, show me your wound.
 How mean…
 To hit me out of the blue…?
 Whoa, interesting.
 Naruto! You can come in!
 What?!
 A cute girl?
 Sakura! This girl!Who the heck is this girl?!
 How dense. It’s the Ninjafrom a moment ago.
 Come to think of it…
 Why…?
 I am Sasame Fuma.
 Sasame… Why were you beingchased by those guys?
 If you like, try talking about it.
 We might be able to help.
 They were the Sound Ninja protectingOrochimaru’s residence.
 What?!
 I’m sorry for mistaking you guys asone of them the other day.
 That doesn’t matter!
 We’re also looking for Orochimaru!
 Would you please give us the details?
 Okay…
 It all started with the Feudal Lordof the Land of Rice Paddies
 launching an attack ona neighboring land
 in an attempt to expand the territory.
 The Land of Rice Paddies is a small land…
 And there aren’t that many Shinobi.
 It was a foolhardy attack.Losing was expected…
 And the Shinobi clans of this land
 who participated inthe losing battle went to ruin…
 We the Fuma Clan as well.
 I hear that amongthe surviving Shinobi,
 there are those who have left the land
 and those who havestooped to become thieves.
 Even so, we’ve lived believingin a restoration of the clan
 and continued to live hidingin the shadows.
 At that time, an emissary of Village Hiddenin the Sound appeared before us
 attempting to create the first full-scaleShinobi village in the Land of Rice Paddies.
 The emissary ofthe Sound Village said…
 My master Orochimaru isgathering all sorts of Jutsu!
 He has taken an interestin your Jutsu well.
 Depending on your work,
 you might be given the chanceto serve the Feudal Lord!
 My cousin Arashi…
 was an up-and-coming starfor the restoration of the clan…
 Arashi as a representative of the clan
 headed for Village Hidden inthe Sound together with the emissary.
 But…
 And then…?
 We waited for a notice from Arashi, but…
 There is no word from him, huh?
 Damn it!He was tricked by that Orochimaru!
 Naruto!
 Oh…!
 Uh, even so, your cousin Arashimight be safe…
 We don’t know, right?And so…and so…
 Idiot…!
 I’m going to save Arashi!
 I have a small body andmy power is weak.
 So no matter what I did…
 I did nothing but become a hindranceeven in Ninjutsu training…
 But Arashi always saved me!
 Everyone in the village hasalready given up, but…
 So I’ll find Village Hiddenin the Sound alone…
 And so you were chased bythe Sound Ninja, right?
 This time, it’s my turn to save Arashi!
 Sasame!
 I…I want to be of help to Arashi!
 Naruto!
 Yeah…I know!
 We have to go to Village of the Soundto bring back Sasuke anyway, so!
 Now instead of one,
 it’s just that there are two guysfor us to bring back.
 I’ll save your cousin, Sasame!
 Right!
 Eew! A spider…
 What’s this?!
 Naruto!
 Wha--! What’s this?!
 Ninja Art: Wind Spiders!
 My cute children made a pathfor me out of silver thread
 and told me where you guyswere going.
 All three of you together will descendinto hell while bearing the secret!
 Naruto! It’s the Ventriloquism Jutsu!
 He’s scattering his voiceto multiple directions
 and covering up location and number!
 I get it! I leave this girl to you, Sakura!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Okay! Bring it on from anywhere!
 It’s a large number,but it’s just Clone Jutsu.
 No. Look closely, Jigumo!
 The threads are getting tangled.
 All of the clones are tangible?!Shadow clones?!
 If so… Kagero!
 Understood…
 Come out!
 Borne to be born, lived to live,one sunrise and one sunset…
 The life of a mayfly lasts but one day.
 Thinking that such a fleeting lifeis pitiable is, in fact, pitiable…
 Know that I’m at my best
 when living in the dark anddeep in the ground!
 Ninja Art:
 Ant Lion Jutsu!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Darn it! What a pesky bunch!
 But I won’t be done in so easily!
 I have to kick that Orochimaru jerk’s butt
 and bring back Sasuke andSasame’s cousin!
 It doesn’t matter if you guysare powerhouses!

51,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Now, let the tenth round begin.
 Do your best!
 Fatso!
 Damn it!
 Those two better watch out!
 I’ll end this match quickly andturn you into mincemeat!
 Then let's not play around...
 I’ll finish you off quickly, Mr. Fatso.
 You bandaged cucumber roll!
 I know his Achilles heel all too wellfrom my last battle with him.
 Those holes in his arm emita pulsing sound, so…
 Ninja Art!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Followed by theHidden Leaf-style Taijutsu!
 All I have to do is to prevent himfrom aiming at my ears!
 Human Boulder Jutsu!
 Hooray for Big-Boned!
 Good!
 Squash him, Choji!
 This guy can attack sonically withouteven touching the opponent…
 But that’s only when ears are showing!
 With Choji’s whole head buried,it’s like he’s wearing ear plugs.
 how does anyone make a sonic attackon a meat ball,
 let alone one that’s rolling?
 The way you are…you can barely move, can you?
 That’s where I attack!
 It’s no use, I’m wearing ear plugs.
 No, this is the end!
 Oh?!
 The human body is made up of 70% water,and water is able to transmit sound waves.
 In other words, your whole body is likeone big ear.
 And the winner is, Kinuta Dosu!
 Lord Orochimaru…no, Orochimaru!
 I’ll have you know that...I’m more than a mere guinea pig.
 Are you all right?
 I-I want to eat meat…
 Oh man...And the guy went easy on him, too.
 Although he lost, the least we cando for him is take him for some BBQ beef.
 It’s finally over.
 At long last, the Final Round…
 With this, the preliminaries forthe third exam is completed.
 A Shadow in Darkness:Danger Approaches Sasuke
 I wonder what’s happened to Naruto?
 Let’s go outside now.
 Iruka Sensei hasn’t been alert recently,so now’s our chance.
 Hey!
 Konohamaru!
 You intend to sneak out again, do you?
 I-I need to go to the bathroom!
 Liar!
 To everyone who has advanced tothe Final Round
 of the third test of the Chunin Exams,
 there’s one person who’s missing,but, congratulations.
 Sensei…
 Hmm?
 I have a question.
 About Sasuke?
 Well, I’m sorry, but I don’t know much.
 But don’t worry too much.
 From here on, it’s up to Sasuke.
 Sakura, I have to step outfor a moment.
 Please inquire about thedetails of the Final Round!
 Sure.
 Here, in our house,including Sasuke who’s not here,
 we have five Leaf,
 three Sand,
 and one Sound.
 Well, I will begin the explanationof the Final Round.
 Finally!
 The preliminary battles haveended without incident.
 It seems they’re now enteringthe Final Round.
 This land really has becomepeaceful, hasn’t it?
 This peaceful time has putthis country in slumber...
 while all the other lands are busy racingto expand their military.
 Would it be possible for usto take it now?
 Humph, I suppose.
 Though, I don’t know how much funit would be to take out that old man.
 Is that so?
 To me, it looks like you are still havea hesitation about it.
 From now on, the power ofeach Hidden Village will clash
 with one another in a longand violent manner.
 The Sound village is also one of them…
 You intend to be the triggerfor all of that…
 And use him for a bullet.
 Our Sasuke…right?
 You guess well.
 So well that it’s a bit creepy.
 Not in the slightest.
 I still had no idea aboutDosu, Zaku or Kin.
 In gathering information on Sasuke,
 I desired to learn their skills
 and carried out tactless things likedeliberately subjecting myself to an attack.
 You overestimated me.
 It seems that you…
 you don’t trust me completely…yet.
 Was it necessary to tell you,my right-hand man,
 about the likes of those three?
 You see, therein liesthe very proof of my trust.
 And because I do…
 I would like to leave Sasukein your hands.
 The Curse Mark that was given to him…
 appears to have been sealed by Kakashi.
 Though, that won’t matter much.
 While there is still somedarkness left in his heart…
 I want you to abduct him.
 That’s an uncharacteristicallyhasty request, is it not?
 There’s a little something troubling me…
 Is it Naruto Uzumaki?
 You’re quite a sharp one,aren’t you?
 Sasuke has lived for revengeagainst his older brother Itachi,
 and will not rest until hehas achieved that aim.
 Nevertheless, in battle with me,
 he was aware that there were thingsbeyond his power and
 faced death without fear.
 I didn’t think he’d be the type ofperson who would be in a hurry to die.
 According to your information,
 contact with that Nine-Tailed kid hasaltered Sasuke’s heart and mind.
 So much so, that he possessessome influence over Sasuke.
 The best thing to do is to get Sasukeaway from him immediately…
 And quickly turn him in my color.
 Well, then…
 Kabuto…
 You...
 If you wish to stop me…
 You have no choicebut to kill young Sasuke, now.
 You can’t possibly kill me…
 Though you are strong, you’re onlyin the same league as Kakashi.
 Just kidding…
 Now, run along.
 I trust you.
 That face…
 I wonder what could possiblybe going on in his head?
 The Final Round is whereeach one of you
 will show off your battle skillsin front of everyone.
 I want you to satisfactorily demonstrateand show off your ability
 as representative battle forcesof your respective lands.
 Accordingly, the Final Round willcommence one month from now.
 W-We’re not going todo it here, right now?
 This is so that there’sa suitable period of preparation.
 What do you mean?
 That is to say…
 Along with the announcement ofthe conclusion
 of the preliminary match to eachcountry’s Daimyo and Shinobi leaders,
 readying the summons forFinal Round requires preparation time—
 not to mention the time it takesfor you examinees to prepare.
 This old man always has sucha roundabout way of saying things.
 I don’t quite get whatyou’re trying to say.
 What do you mean?
 In other words,in order to know your adversary,
 in order to prepare yourself,time is necessary.
 Time to analyze what you learned aboutthe adversaries in the preliminaries...
 time to take stock of your successes.
 The battles until now werelike actual battles-
 it presupposed situations in whichyou can’t know your adversary.
 That’s for sure…
 I never dreamed that this guycould make sand into a weapon.
 However, this is not the casein the Final Round.
 Some of you might have alreadyrevealed everything in front of your rivals…
 In the spirit of fairness and equality,
 you will have a month totrain yourself to further your skills.
 Now, I can’t be thinking of this
 as some sort of month-longholiday and do nothing! Believe it!
 Seriously! Seriously!
 It might not be good idea toexcel too much, is it?
 We failed to stay out of Orochimaru’swatchful eye,
 and it was unfortunate for us both.
 Under this gentle exterior,a seed of evil took root –
 and it was this seed that was exploited…
 Some day, through that Ninjutsu…
 this child will as well…
 Kabuto…
 Who knows?
 Perhaps he really will kill Sasuke.
 I have to give it you, Kakashi…
 Stopping my attack from your blind spot…
 But, you’d better ready at least10 of your men next time.
 The Anbu that I prepared weretaken out without difficulty…
 You’re not an ordinary Genin are you?
 You caught a whiff of me and immediatelyreadied your weapon…
 you’re quite impressive.
 No, I’m not all that.
 What do you want with Sasuke?
 Depending on circumstances,I’ll haul you off to questioning.
 I wonder if that’s possiblefor the likes of you…
 Are you looking to take me on?
 You are the son of the chief of theLeaf medical corps, aren’t you?
 Your name, was it, Kabuto Yakushi?
 Are you affiliated with Orochimaru?
 If you arrest me here now,
 you might never be able to provemy connection to Orochimaru.
 Shut up and confine your answersto my questions.
 What if I say “No”?
 I’m the one asking thequestions around here.
 Now give me some answers.
 You’ll find out before long anywayif you let me go,
 so can you make an exceptionjust this once?
 You, willful little brat…
 Don’t mess around with grown-ups.
 Don’t be so arrogant.
 The circumstances are in my favor…
 I should have known.
 A shadow clone!
 Darn…I've let him escape.
 Impressive…
 As I suspected...
 This is the Dead Soul Jutsu,
 where one temporarily animatesand controls the heart of a dead body.
 Meticulously transforming even the face…
 and also stopping his heartbeatsand eliminating all traces of his body odor…
 in order to prepare an escape byimpersonating a murdered Anbu…
 He wasn't raised as the adopted son ofthe chief of the medical corps for nothing.
 If someone this good is workingfor Orochimaru…
 I can’t stay as I am now…
 Now that that’s done…
 I’d like to let you take your leave…
 But first, for the Final Round,
 there is one more importantmatter to take care of.
 Let’s get on with it,so we can get to training!
 Now, now. I want you all tocalmly take one slip of paper
 from the box that Anko is holding.
 I’m going to go around in order…take only one.
 Good, everyone has takena number.
 Then, from left to right, tell me the number on your slip of paper.
 I’m eight.
 I’m one.
 Seven.
 Five.
 Three.
 Nine.
 Two.
 Six.
 In other words, he has number four.
 Uh-huh.
 Very well, I will tell you
 about how the Final Roundtournament will work.
 Huh?
 Is that what thesedrawing lots were for?
 Ibiki, bring forth the pairings.
 Yes, sir.
 He’s so far away.
 Is that all the Final Round is,a tournament?
 Shoot! I have one extra round.
 Vendetta for Choji?Give me a break!
 I’m so relieved to know thatI won’t be in the same section as Gaara.
 Sasuke Uchiha…
 Perfect.
 Hyuga Neji, right off the bat?
 This couldn’t be better!Believe it!
 Sasuke has to go up against him…?
 Could I ask a question?
 Go ahead.
 Does this mean that there willonly be one winner of the tournament?
 That only one of us will beable to become a Chunin?
 No, on the contrary.
 The judges of the Final Round,of which I am one,
 will be made up of the Kazekage,
 the Daimyo from various countrieswho will assign you your missions,
 and the Shinobi Leaders.
 Through this tournament,
 these judges will be able to makea thorough evaluation,
 and come to a decision as towhether each one of you
 possesses the qualities incumbentof a Chunin.
 Even if someone loses the first round,they can still become a Chunin.
 So there’s a chance that allof us will become Chunin?
 Correct, but conversely,there’s also a chance that none of you will.
 To “advance” in the tournament,
 means maximizing chancesto appeal yourselves to the judges.
 Understood, Shikamaru?
 This is all a real pain in my…
 Thank you for your patience.
 We will adjourn until next month.
 The second round will either beNo Eyebrows from Sand or Sasuke, huh?
 That guy is so strong he kickedBushy Brow’s butt.
 Sand Coffin!
 I want to fight you, too.
 Now that it’s come to this,I’ve got to see Kakashi Sensei.
 Umm, where’s the roomthat Sasuke’s in?
 I’m sorry. Mr. Sasukeis not allowed visitors.
 What?! Hey, hey!What's up with that?!
 I’m sorry, those are the rules.
 Why, Sis, tell me why?
 Naruto, this is a hospital.Keep it down.
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Say! Say!
 I’ve got a favor to ask!
 You don’t need to say it all.
 Well, I thought it wouldcome to this so…
 I searched for someoneto watch your training.
 Why?! I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
 I have some matters to take care of.
 I don’t have the time to troublemyself with you.
 Oh! Aha...!
 You’re going to trainSasuke, aren’t you!
 Well, don't say that.
 I found a sensei who’smore reliable than I am!
 Well…who is it?
 It’s me!
 Huh?
 You!
 The Closet Perve!
 Such insolence!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Darn! I’m not satisfied with this!
 I don't care if you’re elite tutoror whatever,
 but there’s no wayI’m not going to get stronger
 if I’m to learn from the Closet Perveweaker than me!
 I have to get strong by anymeans necessary, no matter what!
 If you’re really a strong ninja,
 just try to convince mewith your sheer strength!

 Return of the Morning Mist
 My mother and my father…They didn’t have to die.
 Because I didn’t have strength,the whole clan was destroyed.
 Everyone was killed…
 Darn it…
 Morning training is over!
 Once I’ve eaten breakfast
 I’ll get back to rigorous training!
 Old man…
 Konohamaru…
 Yo! Konohomaru.
 Naruto.
 Have you already resumed studiesat the academy?
 N-No, not yet.
 The school buildings are damaged,so we’re all repairing them.
 Is that so?
 How about you, Naruto?You’re already training?
 Sort of.
 Wh-What?
 What is it?
 N-No, it’s nothing…
 – Hey um…! 					– Hey um…!
 So what is it…?
 You too, Naruto, what is it?
 Nothing…really…
 I don’t feel lonely.
 Huh?
 There’s no time to be feeling lonely.
 Everyone is working really hardto rebuild the village right now.
 Konohamaru…
 Right now, I must work forthe village even just a little bit.
 So Naruto, you work hardat your training too.
 If you don’t,I’ll become Hokage before you.
 Fool, I will absolutely become Hokage.
 Besides…you have to graduatefrom the Academy first.
 Oh, that’s right…
 Oh, here it is.
 Here, it’s for you.
 A free ramen ticket from Ichiraku…
 Is it okay?
 I already have one,so I’m giving one to you.
 Thank you, Naruto.
 Oh! Konohamaru.
 Good morning.
 I’m going to go.
 We’ll work hard again today.
 – Yep! 					– Yep!
 Today we’re fixing the blackboards.
 I brought paint.
 Well! Once I’ve eaten ramen at Ichiraku,I’ll continue training.
 This is it.
 Th-This is…
 A lot of time has passed since the death.
 It’s probably beforethe Chunin Exam began.
 I see, so that's it…
 That Orochimaru!
 After the murder of Lord Kazekage,
 Orochimaru… or someonelike Kabuto played Kazekage…
 How thoughtless we were…
 That darn Sarutobi…
 Well, it’s not that easy.
 The one who was your opponentwas the renowned Hokage,
 deemed to be strongest ofall five great nations.
 However…you’ve done well.Two out of the five Kages…
 Stop…
 Stop giving me words of sympathy.
 I will kill you!
 Of course, I didn’t mean to…
 It’s true that we didn’t succeedin bringing the village down…
 On the other hand, another objectiveof this plan, Sasuke Uchiha…
 Your leash is now on him.
 In exchange for these armsand all of my Jutsu…
 If we could have gotten our handson that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning,
 it wouldn’t have been a problem.
 However that’s a dream thatcan no longer come true.
 He is stronger than I am.
 That is why…I pulled myself outfrom that organization…
 Kakashi, huh?
 What does he want?
 Breakfast, breakfast!
 Wait for me, my ramen.
 Do you already knowhis whereabouts?
 Yes.
 In that case, it will be easy…
 Let’s go.
 Here it comes, here it comes.
 Oh goodie, it’s just like I thought.
 Hidden Leaf Village…has a high average score.
 You’re still doing sucha ridiculous thing?
 Well yes, this is my research.
 Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh?
 I wonder what you adviserswant from me.
 Surely, you know…
 without our telling you, don’t you?
 You don’t have to makesuch scary faces.
 I heard that the talks with Sand Villagehave been settled without problems.
 The Hidden Village in the Sandannounced that
 everything was Orochimaru’s handiwork.
 In addition, at the moment of theircomplete surrender to us, the Leaf Village,
 that wasn’t a very important issueany more.
 Leaf Village has no choice butto accept their surrender and proposition
 in order to restore national power.
 However, the current strength ofLeaf Village has dropped drastically.
 Under these conditions,
 our top priority must be to preparefor any unpredicted crisis.
 We don’t know when any ofthe neighboring nations
 will come out in a bold move.
 Therefore, we’ve decided that untilthe village gets its strength back,
 we should assemble the top few menfrom each troop,
 and form an emergencyexecutive committee to handle this.
 But first…
 we need a strong, trustworthy leader.
 You can find the seeds of troublerolling around everywhere these days.
 It’s not just Orochimaru.
 You didn’t have to go throughthe trouble of informing me that.
 Well… I’ll continue gathering materials.
 I’m going to tell you the basic plan.
 We need the Fifth Hokage right away.
 And yesterday at an emergency meetingwith the feudal lord of the Land of Fire,
 we decidedit would be you, Jiraiya.
 I’m sorry, it’s not my nature.
 It has been decided.
 Besides, if a Shinobi like you,renowned as a Sannin, is not…
 then who is?
 If you want a Sannin,there is one more left…
 That Tsunade.
 Certainly that child probablyhas that capability, but…
 However, no one knows where she is.
 I’ll find and bring her back.lf I do that there’s no problem, right?
 But…
 A wise one like Tsunade is meant tobe Hokage more than I, with no motivation.
 What do you want to do?
 All right.We’ll give it urgent consideration.
 However, we’ll have three membersfrom Anbu Black Ops to accompany you
 as the search unit for Tsunade.
 Don’t worry, I won’t escape from this.The guards are not necessary.
 However…
 There is one guy that I wantto take with me on my trip.
 I’ve found an interesting egg…
 What? That is absolutely strange.
 Sorry, but if you don’t have a ticket,there’s no ramen.
 No, wait a minute!I absolutely had one more.
 Huh?
 The one that I gave Konohamaru,was it the last?
 Welcome!
 Hey, my ramen!
 ""Racy Violence""
 Yo, you two!
 You seem to be getting along well.
 Fool, Anko asked me tobuy rice dumplings. That’s all.
 What are you doing here?
 While I’m here to buy offerings,I’ve made plans to meet here…
 with Sasuke.
 Huh, it’s rare that you wait for people.
 Is the offering to Obito?
 Obito?
 Well…that’s about right.
 Kakashi, it’s strange foryou to be here first.
 Well… once in a while.
 I don’t do natto (fermented beans)and sweet things.
 Oh… Is that so?
 What?!
 This is absolutely positively strange!
 You guys aren’t from the village…Why in the world did you come?
 I haven’t seen you fora while Asuma, Kurenai.
 If you know about us,are you former Leaf Shinobi?
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?!
 Y-You are?!
 Humph, without a doubt…
 Itachi…
 Uchiha.
 You are acquaintances of Itachi?
 If so…
 I’ll introduce myself as well.
 I’m Kisame Hoshigaki.
 Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you.
 Never mind later,I’m going to beat you now!
 Itachi…
 It seems you’re pretty unpopularin the village too.
 I know you, too.
 Kisame Hoshigake,
 originally a Shinobiof Hidden Village in the Mist.
 Suspected of national covert activitiesand of killing a feudal lord,
 a Rogue Ninja from Land of Water,on the wanted list in all nations.
 You’re a major S-rank criminallisted in the Bingo Book.
 Itachi, you have some nervecoming back to this village
 after causing that awful incident.
 Asuma… Kurenai…
 Don’t interfere with me.
 I don’t intend to kill you.
 That’s not a line for you,who killed your comrades.
 I know there’s no wayyou’d come here
 without any clear purposein those suspicious appearance.
 What are you after?
 This guy is pretty annoying.Should we kill him?
 It doesn’t look like we are ableto leave the village so smoothly…
 But don’t overdo it,your techniques tend to stand out.
 They're done for then.
 This is…
 Genjutsu.
 Pressing down with the tip of his sword…What strength.
 My large sword, Shark Skin…
 doesn’t cut, but lops it off!
 Kurenai… You’re late.
 With this…
 it’s over!
 Genjutsu of that level doesn’t work on me.
 This is…Genjutsu Reversal?
 Kurenai!
 There’s no time to look away.
 That’s what’s expected from you, Kurenai.
 But…
 “But” this is as far as it goes…
 for you.
 What?!
 Water Style!
 – Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
 The same Jutsu as me?!
 Why have you shown up too?
 Well…I asked you to take careof them earlier.
 But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
 Shadow clones.
 Kakashi…
 Hatake.
 Cripes… So much fuss for nothing.
 I…
 I put it under my headband
 in order not to drop the important ticketduring morning training.
 Okay, that’s fine…Eat well and do your best.
 Hmm?
 You’re going to do it againafter this, right? Training?
 Of course! I’m full of motivation.
 Good! Here you go.
 Another serving for free! Go for it!
 Thank you, sir!
 Welcome.
 Just like I heard…I had to come and see it.
 It seems that you reallyare just eating ramen.
 Oh, Pervy Sage!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools
 Itachi Uchiha…
 who became a leader ofAnbu Black Ops at the age of thirteen
 and who destroyedthe Uchiha clan single-handedly.
 I don’t know why he hassuddenly appeared after all this time…
 But I don’t think we willallow him to leave so easily.

209,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 The distance created between usbecame too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouthmakes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile,even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 –Monju. 					–Yes, sir.
 Darn, didn’t know there was a kid here.
 I’ll do it.
 Okay, it’s in your hands, Gantetsu.
 Okay. Let’s pull out!
 Set this place on fire!
 Don’t leave any evidence.
 The Enemy: Ninja Dropouts
 Wait up!
 Over here! You’re it. Try catching me!
 Darn…
 –Yeah! 					–This way! This way!
 I said wait!
 Lady Tsunade…
 With regard to the next request…
 What, there’s more?
 Yes.
 Boy oh boy…
 This is the last oneso please try to focus.
 All right.
 When the weather continuesto be warm like this…
 And what’s the request?
 About the escort for the convoy withthe fugitive who was secured…
 What about it,that’s hardly a difficult mission.
 Well, actually there’s a bitof a problem.
 Please look at this.
 I see. This is somewhat ofa nuisance.
 All of the Jonin are outon S-rank missions,
 and 90% of the main Chunin and Geninhave been allocated elsewhere.
 Who’s left?
 Let’s see…well…
 Multi-Clone Jutsu!
 Let’s go, Bushy Brows!
 Here goes, Naruto!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 You jerk!
 Another serving ofShadow Clones for you!
 You ain’t seen nothing yet!
 You let your guard down!
 Pretty good, Bushy Brow…
 The same to you, Naruto…
 Naruto! Lee!
 Hey, are you guys all right?
 Hey, stop moving.
 Sakura, can’t you bea little more gentle?
 Shut your mouth.Really, you’re being reckless.
 That’s not true, Sakura.
 See, the 100-manShadow Clone grapples
 are excellent trainingfor enhancing one’s Taijutsu skills.
 It’s like killing two birds withone stone for Naruto, too
 because this kind of friendly traininglets him polish
 his Shadow Clone skillsat the same time.
 That’s exactly right.
 What are you talking about?All you’re doing is slugging it out.
 This is what ends up happeningwhen two guys get together.
 That’s right.
 Anyway, this isn’t the time to beacting carefree like that.
 Lady Tsunade is calling for you.
 Grandma Tsunade?
 What does she want?
 Ninja Dropouts?
 Yeah. 					Ninja Dropouts are
 Rogue Ninja who,of their own free will,
 choose not to be Shinobi and leavetheir respective villages to join up.
 They’re a gang of thieves who use brutaland villainous means to steal.
 That’s horrible…using their abilitiesas Ninja for criminal purposes.
 That’s unforgivable.
 One of their members wascaptured yesterday
 in Ogi Passin the Land of Forests.
 This guy is the only member
 whose wanted notice iscircling around the lands.
 He was found wandering aboutand taken prisoner.
 His name is Gantetsu.
 For a former Ninja,that’s pretty lame.
 Gantesu is being taken tothe capital city of the Land of Forests
 in order to do an exhaustive investigationinto this matter
 for the purpose of wiping outthe Ninja Dropouts…
 However, there is a possibilitythat the Ninja Dropouts will try
 to rescue him along the way…
 A police escort has been sentfrom the capital
 so it is fully prepared for the convoy.
 But since the opponents are ex-Ninja,
 the idea is that Shinobi would bethe best countermeasure for Shinobi,
 so they requested that the Leaf Villagealso send out some Ninja.
 That’s what this request is all about.
 I’m getting excited! I’ll show ‘emhow great Leaf Ninja are!
 –Got it!–Let’s give it a shot!
 All right! Naruto Uzumaki,Sakura Haruno, Rock Lee.
 The three of you are assignedto the mission
 of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!
 –Yes, ma’am! 					–Roger!
 Look, the harbor.
 Huh… So they’re gonnatransport him in this.
 The only way to get to the capitalof the Land of Forests is
 to go up this river.
 Hey, look over there.
 That’s…
 The Ninja Dropout, Gantetsu.
 Are you the Leaf Ninja?
 Yes. Uh, and who are you?
 I’m Tsuzumi with the police department.
 I’m supervising this convoy.
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki.
 This guy here’s Bushy Brows andher name is Sakura Haruno.
 Hmmm… You guys are still kids…Are you really Ninja?
 We sure are.
 Huh, we might not look it,
 but we’re all full-fledged Ninja who’vebeen tested by fire numerous times.
 We’ll display our skills for youat some point.
 Just leave it to us.
 Well, I have a strong team ofexperts handling security,
 but if it ever comes to that,
 I’m counting on you to useyour specialty, Ninjutsu.
 Got it.
 Those are the security personnelguarding the prisoner.
 They’re all dressed alike, aren’t they?
 Huh, they don’t have much style.
 Naruto, that’s rude.
 Captain Todoroki!
 What is it, Commander Tsuzumi?
 These people came from
 the Village Hidden in the Leavesas reinforcements.
 The name’s Naruto Uzumaki.
 I’m Sakura Haruno.
 My name is Rock Lee.
 Commander, I told you already.
 We already have enough security on this.
 Can’t be helped.lt’s something the bosses decided.
 There won’t be any role foryou guys to play.
 We will guard Gantetsu.
 I promise that on this sword.
 Huh… That sword’s nothing.
 Snapping that thing in half would beas easy as apple pie.
 Yeah, with just one finger.
 Stop it, you guys!Please excuse them…
 Be careful not to get seasick.
 Well, I leave it to you.
 Y-Yes, sir. Thanks.
 Gantetsu…
 All right…
 Put the cage into the belly of the ship!
 Okay…Okay…
 Okay, lower it!
 Wow…
 This feels great!
 What the heck is this anyway?
 They won’t let us even get near him.
 They’re totally treating us like nuisances.
 If only those Ninja Dropout guyswould launch an attack,
 we could show them how awesomewe are.
 Don’t say stupid things like that.
 The best scenario would be thatthe Ninja Dropout won’t show up at all.
 Our mission is to transport Gantetsusafely to the capital, you know.
 But this is getting too boring…there’s no thrill to it.
 Better just grin and bear it.
 There are missions like this too.
 Well, I sure understandhow you feel, Naruto.
 Yeah… I guess this is gettinga little boring.
 Dig in…
 Gimme a break…
 Who do those guys think we are?
 But this stuff is pretty good.
 Yeah, very tasty.
 It makes me so mad…
 I mean, why did we go to allthe trouble of coming all this way?
 I’m gonna do my mission.
 Gonna stand guard over Gantetsu.
 But the captain’s gonna scold you.
 I’m doing this out of Ninja pride!
 Uh, Naruto!
 Naruto!
 He does have the face ofa criminal after all.
 Todoroki?
 What the heck is he doing here?
 Akio…!
 Damn!
 Father! Mother!
 Akio…
 Akio!
 Damn!
 Akio…!
 I will avenge your death right now!
 Oh!
 What the heck are you doing?!
 Are you in your right mind?
 What was it you were aboutto do just now?!
 Ninja Art: Crimson Mud.
 Oh?
 What’s the matter, Sakura?
 Lee, over there.
 That’s strange…
 I’ve never knew this river has a tributary.
 Why are you in here?
 Why does that matter?
 What were you about to do to Gantetsu!?
 What are you talking about?
 It looked to me likeyou were going to kill him.
 Huh? Me?That’s a stupid thing to say.
 It’s my mission to guard this guy.Why would I?!
 Yeah, I guess.
 Even if he is a criminal,
 you can’t just kill him offwithout interrogating him first.
 A brat talking like he knows, huh?
 There isn’t any need to interrogate him!
 This is the guy who did it!
 Huh?
 This guy…
 These guys…slaughtered a lot of peoplewithout mercy…
 Even innocent children.
 If things continue like this,we’ll be sucked into the tributary…
 What should we do?!
 Ninja Art: Link and Slay.
 What the heck?!
 Wh-What is this?
 Th-The ship’s been sliced in half…
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 You jerk!
 It’s them! The Ninja Dropouts!
 So they showed up after all…
 Gantetsu…
 Reinforcements, huh?!
 Hey, who are you guys anyway!
 The head of the Ninja Dropouts,Shura, on the scene!
 Ninja Dropouts…
 We’ll take Gantetsu…
 I’m not about to let that happen!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Lee, are you all right?
 Yes, somehow.More importantly, what happened?
 I don’t know.
 Only thing I know is that afterthat huge crash,
 suddenly the ship was sliced in two…
 I see.
 Well then, we need to confirm everyone’ssafety for the moment…
 Well…
 What’s wrong, Sakura?
 I can’t find the prisoner, Gantetsu,Captain Todoroki, and Naruto.

 The Secrets of the Mangekyo Sharingan
 No matter what darknessmight lie ahead,
 I will rush into it headfirst!
 No matter what happens,
 I will get my handson that power!

 What was that?
 I thought I sensedsomeone there just now…
 The lights…
 It isn’t even closeto bedtime yet…
 This is…!
 Wh-What is this…?!
 What the hell is this?!
 Uncle… Aunt…
 Father… Mother…
 Father? Mother?
 There’s somebody in there!
 Move!
 Move!
 Move!
 Father! Mother!
 Big Brother!
 Big Brother!Father and Mother are…!
 Why? For what reason?!
 Who the hell would dosomething like this…?!
 Big Brother…what are…?
 What are you doing, Big Brother?!
 You pathetic younger brother…
 Mangekyo Sharingan!
 Stop! Big Brother!
 Don’t make me seethis kind of thing!
 Why…?!
 Big Brother, why did you…?!
 Why…
 Big Brother… Why did you…?
 In order to measure my vessel…
 To measure your vessel?
 Is that all?
 Only for that reason…you killed everybody…?
 That is what is important.
 What the hell is that?
 You gotta be kidding!
 I’m scared…
 I’m scared!
 Don’t kill me…!
 I don’t believe it!
 This is too unlike you, Big Brother.I mean…
 The reason I acted as the big brotheryou desired was…
 because I wanted tomeasure your vessel.
 You have the potentialto become my opponent
 in order for me to measuremy vessel.
 You hated me…
 and you continued to havethe desire to surpass me.
 That’s exactly whyI will allow you to live…
 for my own benefit.
 You are someone who could be able to useMangekyo Sharingan just like me.
 However, on one condition…
 That you must killyour closest friend…
 Y-You’ve gotta be kidding…
 Just like I did…
 Regarding Shisui Uchihawho committed suicide last night
 by throwing himself intothe Nakano River…
 The other one that did not show upto the meeting is Shisui…
 If I remember correctly…
 you adored him likehe was your real older brother…
 That was…your doing…?
 Big Brother, you…killed Shisui?!
 That’s right…and because ofthat I obtained these eyes.
 The main hall of Nakano Shrine…
 Underneath the seventh tatami maton the far right
 is the secret gathering placeof the Clan.
 There you will find recordedthe secret of…
 the raison d'être ofthe Uchiha Clan’s Visual Jutsu.
 The secret of the raison d'être…?
 If you attain these eyes,
 you will become the third personincluding myself
 to utilizethe Mangekyo Sharingan.
 If that happens…
 then there will have been meaningin my allowing you to live.
 However…at present…
 You are not worth killing.
 My pathetic younger brother…
 If you want to kill me,then begrudge me!
 Hate me!
 And live in an ugly manner…
 Run away…run away…and cling to life…
 And one day, when you havethe same eyes as I do…
 come and stand before me!
 A dream…?
 Yes…that’s right.
 The only one who survived…is that boy.
 Didn't he havean older brother?
 Yes, but he’s gone missing…
 It can’t be true…That elite Uchiha Clan…
 Hi, Sasuke! What did youcome to buy today?
 Sasuke, are you on your way to school?
 Yeah.
 I saw Itachi earlier,but he’s very admirable, isn’t he?
 He’s already becomea top-class Shinobi.
 He graduated from the Ninja Academyat the top of his class at age seven
 and attained the rankof Chunin at age ten, didn’t he?
 He was able to use Sharinganwhen he was eight!
 That’s true, isn’t it?
 That boy is truly the prideof the Uchiha Clan.
 Welcome home…Sasuke!
 Sasuke…!
 Wait a second…
 What is it?
 Mother?!
 Then why only Big Brother!
 Your brother's your brother.And you are you.
 Father cares deeplyabout both of you.
 The main hall of Nakano Shrine…
 Located underneaththe seventh tatami mat on the far right
 is our clan’s secret gathering place…
 I see… So that’s what it is…
 Ninja Academy
 Hey, Shikamaru…
 Wanna go to the candy shopafter school?
 Huh… No way.
 You can do that ‘cuzyour mother’s nice,
 but if my mother found out that I boughtmyself a snack before going home,
 I’d be in big trouble.
 Did you hear the news…
 that entire Uchiha Clanwas apparently murdered?
 Yeah, my dad told me.
 Apparently he’s the only onewho survived…
 That’s my boy.
 With me, you’re allyour father talks about…
 I wonder…what kind of thingsFather was saying to Mother…
 If you want to kill me…
 Begrudge me! Hate me!
 If it’s for the purpose of killing you,
 I will rush headfirst into whateverdarkness which may lie ahead!
 I will obtain that power no matter what!
 From this point onwards,I am an avenger!
 Sasuke is nowin depths of darkness…
 If you stop in a place like this…
 you won’t be able to catch upwith Sasuke.
 Neji, it’s just like you said.
 That guy looks like he’s inthe depths of darkness right now…
 He really hit me withhis full strength! Damn it!
 Don’t you consider me…your comrade any longer?!
 Don’t all those things we did togetherin Squad Seven mean anything to you?!
 No.
 I will get my hands onthat power no matter what.
 It wasn’t meaningless…
 To me, you became my…closest friend.
 We've become…friends?
 Then…why?!
 All the more reason why…
 All the more reason why…
 there’s meaning in takingyou down.
 I don’t fully understand but…
 I understood that you want tofight me with your everything!
 Sasuke…!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Are you trying to take medown for real?
 I don’t know any longer
 whether you really meantwhat you said earlier or not!
 Could it be that it was only Iwho thought we were friends?
 If that’s the case,I’m just a really lame guy…
 Aren’t I? Sasuke?

 A coup at the Land of Green…?
 Yes, it seems there’s no mistake.
 The retainers conspired withsome men
 and began a rebellion…
 What happened to Narutoand the others?
 Speculating from their gathering point,
 they are around here.
 So they’ve alreadycrossed the border…
 The large countries have agreedto make this
 a demilitarized zone.
 Considering Naruto andthe other’s mission,
 they should be in a safe area…
 Are you sure?
 What do you mean…?
 Don’t you think the timingof this request
 strangely overlaps with the coup?
 Then you’re saying that Naruto’s missionis also related to this case?
 There is a possibility…
 But there’s no time to dealwith Naruto at the moment.
 We have to take backthe Land of Green
 from the rebels as soon as possible.
 If we leave it like this,
 the flames of the war will eventuallyreach other countries…
 True…
 Shizune, gather the free villagers
 and have them head tothe Land of Green immediately!
 Yes, ma'am!
 You’ve done it now!
 What a persistent brat…!
 You shouldn't be ableto stand anymore…
 Naruto!
 This is…nothing.
 What a surprise…you got some guts.
 Then, take this too!
 Ninja Art Magnet!Electromagnetic Illusion.
 Naruto!
 It’s useless!Your voice wouldn’t reach him!
 The human brain functions by
 a faint electric currentrunning through it…
 If you receivemy magnetic force powder,
 it’s going to alter your electriccurrent and stop your thinking…
 That chain also hasa strong magnetic force.
 Now, get buried!
 Naruto!
 Are you okay?
 Thank goodness…
 Hinata…run!
 I can’t leave you behind…
 He is…
 He’s someone thatyou can’t deal with…
 Naruto… I promise I’ll save you!
 Hinata!
 I’ll have you tell mewhere that girl is!
 Byakugan!
 Take this!Electromagnetic Illusion!
 Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!
 What?!
 I see, so that is the Byakuganof the Village Hidden in Leaves…
 How interesting!
 What wonderful Taijutsu, but…
 I’ll crush itwith my power!
 I did it…?!
 Yeah right…That level of Taijutsu will not work!
 It’s useless!
 This is bad…!
 You’re not much of a challenge.I’m disappointed!
 Now tell me!Where did you hide that girl?
 If you answer me, I’ll let you live…That boy too!
 If you rescue him right now,he wouldn’t die.
 Run…Hinata…
 Now say it!
 You don’t want to savethat boy?
 Or do you think you could winagainst me?
 If I say it…Naruto would never forgive me.
 Then I’ll force you to talk!
 I’ll change the area behind youinto a powerful magnet.
 I can change the position of the magnetaccording to your movement.
 So it's a waste to run away!
 That brat…
 She evaded the attack by throwinga paper bomb at that very instant.
 She’s pretty quick witted.
 But…
 I won’t let you go!
 Hinata…
 Naruto… I promise thatI’ll return to rescue you…!
 But, there is a huge differencein power between him and me…
 I could never win against him!
 He’s already caught up to me…What should I do?
 This is…iron sand…?
 I see…his Jutsu canchange his body
 and the things he touchesinto magnet.
 The reason why he didn’t attackback there
 was to brush off the iron sandfrom his body…
 If he doesn’t,he would sink in his iron sand.
 His attack pattern consists ofalternating between
 Ninja Art Magnetand Iron Sand Genjutsu …
 He does this to turnhis magnet powers on and off
 so his body won’tcompletely turn into a magnet.
 Then, there is one wayto beat him!
 Now…play time is almost over!
 Now, it’s time you give up!
 I would never give up!
 Because that is my Ninja Way!
 What a waste…
 How dare you do that to Naruto!
 I will definitely not forgive you!
 Once you say wherethat girl is,
 why don’t you live withthat brat in hell!
 Hey, don’t be shyand come closer!
 Right now!
 I’ll risk everythingin this single attack!
 An attack that didn’t work before,
 will never work!
 Is…that right?
 What?!
 We're both going to hell!
 Let go, you!
 You brat! How dare you playaround with me!
 I changed my mind.I’ll finish you off now!
 What is this?!
 Just now…I struck a Chakra Point
 that would make your Chakra flowgo out of control.
 Now your body will just turninto a strong magnet…
 What…? That’s why you brought meto this sandy area?!
 S-Stop!
 I did it…Naruto…
 Damn…! I can’t move!
 The Human Boulder!
 Naruto!
 Choji…!
 Are you okay, Naruto…?
 Thanks…Yurinojou.
 So what happened?
 The second Janin attacked meand I got beaten up.
 What happened to Hinataand the princess?
 Oh yeah…!
 I can’t stay here!
 What…?What’s going on…? Naruto?
 Hinata is in danger!
 –Oh! Naruto! 					–Naruto!
 Hinata!
 Are you okay…Hinata?
 Hang in there, Hinata!
 N-Naruto… Choji…
 Yurinojou…
 You guys…you guys came to rescue me…
 Of course…We’re friends, right?!
 Yes!
 By the way, that magnet guy…Where did he go?
 He probably sunk into the sand…
 What?! You did it, Hinata?
 Yeah… I did my best…
 Hinata, you’re great…
 The guy that I couldn’t handle…
 You’re complimenting me?
 Naruto…
 Here…
 This is…my forehead band?
 The mission is not over yet.
 Naruto, please protect the princess…Princess Haruna.
 Hinata…
 I’ll promise you!
 I swear on this forehead bandI will definitely protect the Princess!
 And…
 I can’t be losing against you!
 Naruto…
 Look after Hinata, Choji…Yurinojou!
 Right!
 Leave it to us…Naruto!
 Well, I’ll be darned.
 I can’t believe that Ruigaand Jiga were both defeated.
 Well, that saves sometrouble though…
 Nobody has ever escapedfrom my Jutsu.
 Today will be a good day.
 Haruna! Where are you?!
 There she is!
 Haruna! Get a hold of yourself!
 Are you okay?
 I’m glad…
 I-It’s me, Princess Haruna!
 N-Naruto…
 I came to rescue you,
 but what is this treatment?
 Sorry…
 Why did you escape by yourself?
 I can’t count on you guys…
 I will try to surviveno matter who's sacrificed…
 As long as I survive,the Land of Green can be revived.
 That’s the most important thing, right?!
 I am a victim!
 If I declare that other countrieswill lend me their power.
 If I take back the country and
 I, the true successor,become the feudal lord,
 then people will definitely gather and
 the Land of Green will returnto the way it was!
 I don’t think so.
 You’re saying thatthe Land of Green won’t revive?
 I’m not saying that…
 But I just thought what if I livedin the Land of Green…
 If I was a Ninja just like Yurinojou…
 I won’t guard a feudal lord like you!
 Naruto!
 What do you know?!What do you know about me?!
 What do you know about my lifeas a hostage?!
 Under watch 24/7,
 not even allowed to havemy own free time,
 I was lonely everyday.
 Because of that lifestyle,
 I became sick and wasin bed for a long time.
 I was finally able to return homeafter being close to dying…
 Naruto! If you’re saying thatI’m wrong, then answer me!
 Were the things done to me
 in the name of protectingthe Land of Green all wrong?!
 Then why did my father and mothersend me away as a hostage?!
 Answer me! Naruto!
 I won’t count on you.
 I will go by myself.
 Wait. 					I will go too.
 I promised Hinata that I willdefinitely protect you, princess!
 With Hinata…?
 She fought withthe second Janin
 and got hurt badly....
 Hinata did…?
 You guys said that you didn’t acceptthe mission of protecting me.
 Then, why do you concern yourselveswith me?
 I…
 Not only me,but Hinata and Choji, too.
 We don't like it when somebody before usis hurt or sad… That's all.
 Well, let’s go!
 If we pass through the valleyahead of us,
 we’ll get to the town.
 If we do that, they probably won'tchase us all the way there!
 Please be careful…
 No one uses this deer path.
 This should shake them…
 I found you!
 It’s impossible…to run away from me!
 Choji?!
 Don’t make useless efforts…
 I’ll make you guys my hostages!
 You guys take them back to the castle!
 Yes!
 If you wander around me
 you might get caughtin my Jutsu and die.
 That’s it…We’re almost there!
 There’s no time to waste!Let’s go!
 Okay!
 Haruna!
 I’m okay!
 Oh no!
 Wh-What is this?!
 I see… You have good senseto dodge that attack!
 Who is it?! 					Where are you?!
 Here, over here!
 Too bad, but you guys won’tbe able to reach that village.
 Since you guys are goingto die here!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 Damn! He is so troublesome!
 How dare he use manyshowy attacks.
 There is no way I can retaliate!
 I've gotta do something.
 At this rate, I’m gonna get corneredand shot.
 But even if I wanted to hide,Haruna’s legs are…
 Oh, damn it!
 What in the world should I do?!

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,

 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.

 Reunion: The Remaining Time
 What’s going to happen?!
 What’s the deal?!
 Sumaru’s mom is beingpressed back!
 My star training isdone my own way.
 It shouldn’t be a match
 for one who has completedproper star training like you.
 But what’s with that sorry state…?
 I can’t feel even a smidgeonof the power from before.
 Sure enough, you’ve also gotside-effects from the star training…
 Even if this life should end…
 I’ll never forgive you!
 Lord Akahoshi!
 What?
 You be a good boy!
 It’s a simple mission.
 We’ll be able to come back homeright away.
 Right! Have a safe journey.
 Mother!
 Mother!
 Mother!
 Sumaru…!
 Mother!
 Sumaru!
 Oh, no!
 Lord Akahoshi.Why would you do such a thing?
 Is it true then…?
 Give it back…
 Hold it!
 Farewell.
 Wh-What?
 Then it was Lord Akahoshi
 who knocked everyone outand took Sumaru away?
 A sensei who does somethinglike that
 to students who believe in himis unforgivable!
 Why in the world…?Why would you do such a thing?
 It’s all for the sake of the village…
 It’s for the sake of taking backthe star she stole!
 Even if that were the case,
 that doesn’t make for a reasonto cause Sumaru pain!
 That person is Sumaru’s mom!
 M-My…mother…
 Exactly!
 However, even if she is your mother,she’s now your enemy!
 The person before you isthe woman who stole the star
 and attempted to bring aboutthe doom to our village!
 That’s wrong!
 Sumaru’s mom just hid the star
 in order to save everyone fromthe pain of the training!
 Foolishness! Being able to diefor the sake of the village
 is a Shinobi’s long-cherished dream!
 Isn’t that right, Sumaru?!
 You’re going to become the Hoshikageand put to shame
 the Five Great Hidden Villagesthat treated us with contempt, right?
 Yes… I want to become the Hoshikageand put them to shame…
 Show your foolish motheryour determination!
 Yes… I can die if it’s forthe sake of the village.
 Sumaru!
 Don’t do anything stupid, Sumaru!
 His Chakra is in synch with Akahoshi’s.
 Sumaru is being controlled!
 What?!
 Exactly… I have Sumaru’s lifein the palm of my hand.
 Lady Natsuhi.
 I shall give you the ultimate choice!
 Will you take the star?
 Or…your son’s life?
 Wait!
 What’s the matter, Lady Natsuhi?
 Have you realizedyour own foolishness?
 Lady…
 You win, Akahoshi.
 Sumaru!
 You did it!
 Excellent. How did you get it?
 Simple, Lady Natsuhi returned itwith good grace.
 Lady!
 That’s dirty!
 Sumaru!
 Sumaru…
 Is that person…really…?
 What’re you doing?!
 Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – You…! I won’t forgive you!– You…! I won’t forgive you!
 Hidden Leaf Shinobi,I’m your employer.
 – That doesn’t make any difference!– That doesn’t make any difference!
 Wait, Naruto!
 Neji!
 Why, Neji? I can’t stand this either.
 No! From here on is an issuefor the Hidden Star.
 It’s none of our concern!
 That being said, are we just goingto leave them be?
 Anything further would be beyondthe scope of the mission…
 The Leaf must not betray the clientof the accepted mission, right?
 Damn it!
 Oh well.
 The star has returned.I’ll overlook everyone’s actions today.
 Those who wish to continue to livefor the sake of the village, come with me…
 B-But…Sumaru is…
 Forsake the son of the traitor.
 Pull out!
 Yes, my lord!
 I’m sorry. I must not leaveSumaru behind.
 Rogue Ninja!
 Hokuto! You’ll regret this!
 Well, do as you like!
 That jerk…!
 Hey, look…!
 It’s called Natsuboshi.
 It’s the other name forthe planet Mars, right?
 It seems it’s the same nameas Sumaru’s mom…
 Sumaru thinks that staris protecting him.
 I bet Lady Natsuhi was alsolooking at that star.
 I’m moved.
 The hearts of parent and childare connected!
 Yeah…
 How’re the two doing?
 They’re resting comfortably now…
 But Akahoshi attackthe mother took
 when her body was weakenedfrom the effects of the star is a fatal one.
 Her Chakra Network is in shredsand it will mean certain death
 if she uses that Jutsueven one more time…
 Say what?! But Old Lady Tsunade could…
 Who knows…?
 Damn it! That Akahoshi jerkis unforgivable!
 I’ll kick his butt!
 Naruto…! You still don’t get it?
 But he’s a huge scoundrel.
 That’s right!
 The Leaf would lose credibility
 if we do something like betraying a client.
 But we can’t leave things be, right?
 Well, I also understand whatNeji’s saying.
 We must ask the Lady Hokagefor instructions.
 That’s right.
 Anyway, let’s take those two tothe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Yeah… The Hidden Star matterwill come after that.
 Sumaru.
 Mother!
 Mother.
 You’re probably angry,aren’t you, Sumaru…?
 Of course, you would resent me…who abandoned the village
 and went so far as to entrust youto someone else.
 How often I attempted to take youwith me…
 But I kept telling myself that
 I couldn’t make you happy sinceI had become a Rogue Ninja…
 with this body that couldgive out at any time
 due to the star training.
 Stay away!
 I often had the same dream.
 A dream where I chaseafter you two, crying.
 Sumaru.
 Mother!
 I kept telling myself
 that my mother was nota cold-hearted person
 who would leave me behind…
 You had died.
 Like that man, the Third Hoshikage said.
 He said you had been killed bya Ninja from some other land,
 died and turned into a star…
 He said you had turnedinto the Natsuhiboshi…!
 Sumaru…
 Mother!
 Even so…
 Even so…I wanted you totake me with you.
 Sumaru…
 I was lonesome… Mother…
 Natsuboshi, why are you so red?
 Because I had a sad dream last night
 My eyes are red, from the tears I shed
 Swollen as I cried…
 Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?
 I'm searching for a childwho has gone afar
 He can't be found. though I search all day
 My sad dreams come once more
 Hey! Sumaru! Wake up, Sumaru!
 Where’s the lady? Your mom.
 Hey, where’d she go?
 What?!
 This is bad…
 Mother!
 Even if it costs my life,I can’t let that star be…
 There mustn’t be any moresad mothers and children!
 Can’t let it happen.lf she gets reckless…
 and ends up using that Jutsu again…
 It became the village’s powerand protected the village.
 I didn’t want to have to destroy it…
 But star, you have causedpain and suffering
 to one too many of the children…
 Forgive me…
 Akahoshi…
 Ninja Art: Kujaku
 Beast!
 Sumaru…
 So your strength has given out?How tragic.
 Mother…
 Hey, what’s the matter?
 It couldn’t be! Lady Natsuhi is…
 Mother died!
 As of this moment,
 I, Akahoshi, shall bear the nameof Fourth Hoshikage!
 I shall announce the first missionas Hoshikage.
 The Rogue Ninja, Sumaru and Hokuto,
 and the Hidden Leaf Shinobiare enemies who demean us!
 If you find them attemptingto enter the village,
 bring them down immediately!
 Yes, my lord!
 I will…
 I will get the one who killedmy mother!

 His opponent is that Neji, huh…?
 The Final Round is altogether differentthan the preliminaries…
 After all, Naruto may not be able to…
 Entertain me a little, Naruto.
 I’ve got a tough job waitingfor me now, so…
 Ultimate Defense: Zero Blind Spot!
 Dang it. I can’t catch him at all.
 I told you I’m notsuch a fool, didn’t I?
 I already know…which one is the real one.
 Oh.
 That is the bodythat has least attacks
 due to its fear of havingChakra Points attacked.
 The more you attack,
 the more that one bodybecomes clearly evident.
 You’re the real one.
 Naruto…
 This is as far as it goes.
 I said it was pointless.
 Don’t let him beat you, Naruto.
 I’ve been telling you notto frivolously assume things.
 What?
 It can’t be.
 All right! Go, Naruto!
 Naruto…!
 He foiled my idea and purposelyand drew one of his clones back?
 I’ve been striking from the beginning,prepared for an honorable death!
 Believe it!
 I did it.
 That’s…
 W-What was that?
 Did you think you’d won?
 Why?
 Naruto’s punch should’ve hit.
 That…
 Rotation...
 That’s Neji’s defense.
 You punk.Don’t make a fool of me.
 The largest range of vision ofNeji’s Byakugan is nearly 360 degrees.
 And he detects all of his opponent’sattacks with the Byakugan.
 His defense technique,the 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation,
 will begin from here.
 The moment he’s attacked,he discharges a large amount of Chakra
 from the Chakra holes in the body,blocks the enemy’s attack with that Chakra,
 moves his own body in a circular motion,dodges and repels.
 Essentially, it’s difficult to controlthe Chakra discharged from Chakra holes…
 To the extent that even Jonin utilizethe discharge from a part of the body,
 like the hands and feet,in techniques.
 But Neji who has masteredGentle Fist discharges Chakra
 from his entire body andshuts out physical attacks
 just with that discharge power.
 In other words,
 that’s one more absolute defense
 that has more powerthan that Gaara’s Sand Shield.
 T-That’s father’s…
 The Rotation is a secret Art passed downfrom generation to generation
 only to the Hyuga head family,in other words the Hyuga clan.
 He created that on his own…?
 He’s quite the guy…To think he’d come this far.
 It’s much too soon to be surprised.Neji’s true power is still to come.
 Dang it.
 This is the end.
 You’re within the area of my 8 Trigrams.
 Gentle Fist Art.
 8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
 It can’t be.
 That pose.
 8 Tetragrams…
 …2 Palms!
 4 Palms.
 8 Palms.
 16 Palms.
 32 Palms.
 64 Palms!
 The branch family exceedsthe head family?
 It’s over.
 Truly a terrifying talent.
 To think the power of theHyuga Kekkei Genkai
 would be passed on so stronglyto a child of the branch family
 who would never be ableto be an heir.
 Hizashi… You should havesucceeded the Hyuga family.
 I pressed the 64 Chakra Pointsall over your body…
 You can’t even stand.
 D-Dang it.
 Are you frustrated?
 Kneeling down before powerthat can’t be changed
 and knowing your powerlessness.
 Your dreams will come trueif you just work hard.
 That’s just an illusion.
 Hey, Hinata. Are you okay?
 Oh, man. I knew it.
 Naruto.
 Bushy brow…
 Hinata.
 D-Dang it.
 Oh.
 Naruto.
 He… No way.
 I told you, didn’t I…?
 I don’t know when to give up.
 No way.
 Hey, you’re bleeding.
 What’s wrong?
 You’ve still got damagefrom the match.
 Hinata… Hang in there.
 I’ll take a look at her.
 Who’re you?
 I’m not suspicious or anything.
 Stop already…
 It’ll be the same even ifyou fight more than this.
 I don’t have a grudge particularlyagainst you.
 S-Shut up…
 Even if you say so,I have something against you.
 What are you talking about?
 Why…? Here you’re this strong…
 Why did you, with a look likeyou’ve seen through it all,
 go after Hinata mentallywho was trying so hard?
 It has nothing to do with you.
 Mocking Hinata, selfishly labelingher a failure as you please.
 Head family, branch family…
 I don’t know what happened to you.
 But I won’t forgive the jerk who’dcall another person a failure.
 Hey, you.
 It’s okay. I’m a doctor.
 Okay… Fine.
 If you insist, I’ll tell you aboutthe Hyuga’s destiny of hatred.
 In the Hyuga head family,there’s a secret Ninjutsu
 that’s been passed onfrom generation to generation.
 That is the Curse Mark Arts.
 Curse Mark Arts?
 The Curse Mark representsa bird in a cage…
 and it’s a mark of those who arebound to a destiny they can’t escape.
 W-What’s…
 ...t-that mark?
 One day when I was four years old,
 this accursed mark was inscribedon my forehead with the Curse Mark Arts.
 A large ceremony was held inthe Village Hidden in Leaves on that day.
 It was also the day when thehead Ninja of the Land of Lightning,
 the land that the Leaf hadfought with for many years,
 came for the conclusionof the allied treaty.
 However, there was one clan…
 who didn’t attend the ceremonythat was attended
 by everybody else,from Leaf Jonin to Genin.
 It was the Hyuga clan…
 And it’s because that daywas the day of hope
 when the head family heirwas to turn three.
 Miss Hinata’s third birthday!
 My father, Hizashi Hyuga,
 and Miss Hinata’s father who’s over there,Lord Hiashi Hyuga, were twin brothers.
 However, Miss Hinata’s father,Lord Hiashi,
 is the eldest son of the head familyborn into this world first.
 And my father who was the second sonis a member of the branch family.
 So Miss Hinata is already three…
 Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 She’s a cute girl, isn’t she, father?
 What’s wrong, father?
 Oh, it’s nothing.
 Then…
 I’ll be taking Neji under my care, Hizashi.
 Yes.
 When the head family heir grewand became three years old,
 I had the Curse Mark imprinted on meand I became the bird in the cage.
 And became the Hyuga branch family.
 Why’s it necessary to dosomething like that?
 Why separate into a head familyand a branch family?
 What does that weird mark mean?
 This mark on my foreheadisn’t just a decoration.
 The pull of your legs is weak.
 Yes.
 Listen, Neji.
 You will live to protect Miss Hinataof the head family
 as well as the Hyuga power.
 Yes, father.
 Murderous Intent.
 My head.
 Father.
 What’s wrong, father?
 Go home.I’ll forgive the fool today only.
 You’re not to forget your destiny.
 This Curse Mark is the absolute fearcalled death so to speak…
 that was given to the branch familyby the head family.
 The Secret Sign that thehead family members form easily
 destroys the cerebral nervesof those in the branch family.
 Of course, killing is easy.
 And this mark only goes awayat time of death.
 Sealing away the powerof the Byakugan.
 The Hyuga family is the clan that possessesthe most distinctive Kekkei Genkai.
 There’s no end to those whotarget the secret of that distinctive power.
 In other words, this Curse Markkeeps the branch family alive
 only to protect the head familyand does not allow disobedience.
 And it’s an effective system createdto defend for eternity
 the Kekkei Genkai called Byakugan.
 And then, that incident occurred.
 My father was killed bythe head family.
 One night, Miss Hinata wassnatched up by someone.
 At that time, Lord Hiashi immediatelyrushed off and killed the abductor.
 Who do you think that person was…
 who was in the shadows,and also wearing a mask?
 It was the head ninja ofthe Land of Lightning
 who had just completedthe allied treaty.
 It was clear that he came targetingthe secret of Byakugan from the start.
 However, the Land of Lightningexploited the killing of their own Ninja
 due to a botched plan…
 and set an outrageous condition inviolation of the treaty with the Hidden Leaf.
 Naturally, things got worse and worse,
 and there was almost a warbetween the Leaf and the Lightning.
 However, the Leaf whowanted to avoid war
 made a deal with the Lightning.
 A deal?
 The Lightning demand wasthe body of the Hyuga head family
 who possesses Byakugan,the Kekkei Genkai…
 In other words,the body of Lord Hiashi.
 And the Leaf accepted the condition.
 What? But, father…
 And war was safely avoided.
 Thanks to my father who was killedas a body double of Hiashi Hyuga,
 to protect the head family!
 Other than dying, there’s no other wayto escape this accursed Curse Mark.
 Even though they were twinswith nearly equal power,
 their destinies were already set bywho was born first and born later.
 And then, this match…
 Your destiny was decided at the pointwhen I became your opponent.
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

 As for me, I want to train more,get stronger and…
 “I’ll become Hokage someday,believe it,” huh?
 A person like that…
 would never betray the expectationsof his adorable juniors, would he?
 Become a unit leader andissue appropriate instructions…
 Protect the lives of your menand promptly carry out your mission…
 I thought this mission I’m giving you guys…
 is ideal practice for becoming Hokage.
 Ideal practice for becoming…Hokage?
 If you’re going so far as to say that,then it can’t be helped…
 It’s too bad…
 Whoa! Kidding, kidding,kidding, just kidding!
 Say so sooner if that’s the case.
 Practice for becoming Hokage…
 Yeah-yeah…That has a nice ring to it.
 He fell for it.
 Jeez, he’s naïve…
 Naruto…
 Now then,my adorable team members…are…
 These guys…?
 Oh! Why the heck are youon that side?!
 Man, I don’t want to do sucha troublesome mission either.
 Shikamaru will bean assistant to us instructors.
 I will now begin the explanationof the outdoor training
 to be conducted overone night and two days.
 This is the spot you allwill be setting out for…
 Great Stone Face of Warudakumion the summit of Mount Takurami.
 The team leader will not take routesother than the ones indicated on the map…
 in order to ensure the safetyof the Academy students.
 Along the way, there will be obstacles suchas instructors disguised as enemy Ninja,
 as well as trap and the like.
 But you Academy studentsshould be able to safely evade them
 if you act according to the instructionsof your team leaders.
 You’ll seethe Stone Face of Warudakumi
 after you cover abouteighty kilometers.
 The team that brings the secret documenthidden there back to the village…
 will have completed the trainingupon crossing the finish line.
 There is only one secret document.
 This will be a competitionwith the other teams.
 All right.We’ll finish first, no matter what!
 You guys ready?!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 An important thing about survival isacquiring food with your own resources…
 This is called Beef Sashimi Grassand it grows in this area…
 You can eat it raw and
 it becomes precious foodwhen the chips are down…
 – Wow! 					– Wow!
 All right! All members acquire food!
 – Yay! 					– Yay!
 This is it!
 Let’s eat…
 That’s a Blowfish Sashimi Grass.lt’s a very similar poisonous grass.
 See? The shape of the leafis a bit different, right…?
 You two be careful as well, okay?
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Listen up, an important thing in survivalis to acquire food by your own resources.
 Something’s not right!
 Disappointing, isn’t it…?
 I’ve got an uneasy feeling…
 Let’s see…
 The geography in this areathrows magnets out of kilter…
 When you can’t use a compass…
 Huh?
 You’re wearing a watch, right?
 Oh…yes!
 Look for the bisecting angle,
 which divides the 12:00 direction and thecurrent direction of the hour hand in two…
 And then, when you line up that directionwith the sun as of now…
 the approximate 12:00 direction is south.
 Remember that!
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Let’s…see…
 Huh? This way…?
 Hey, Konohamaru…
 This way?
 No doubt about it…
 He’s totally lost…
 Right, right!
 Yikes…This is bad, believe it.
 A-All right! This way!
 Come with me, believe it!
 Will it be okay?
 That was a more challenging routethan I thought, wasn’t it, guys?
 Challenging, my foot!We’re back at where we came from!
 Man, we can’t trust you,Brother Naruto!
 Then why don’t you try?!
 Give me that!
 Oh… It’s this way.
 N-Not bad…
 What’s the matter, Konohamaru?!
 What’re you doing, Konohamaru?!Give me that!
 Sorry… Here.
 Let me see…
 Oh, it’s that way!
 What were you guys doing?!
 Hey, we’ve come back again!
 What…? How in the world canwe get out of here?!
 All right… I’ll do my best!
 I don’t feel good…
 Hey!
 Good grief…
 Are you guys okay?
 – Yes, Lee Sensei!– Yes, Lee Sensei!
 What did you say…just now?!
 – Yes, Lee Sensei!– Yes, Lee Sensei!
 Lee Sensei…!Ahh, that has such a lovely ring to it.
 This is youth, this is extreme youth!
 Now, run towards that setting sun!
 – Yes, Lee Sensei!– Yes, Lee Sensei!
 Your sweat sparkling inthe setting sun is wonderful!
 – Yes, Lee Sensei!– Yes, Lee Sensei!
 Finally made it, huh…?
 Now, I guess I’ll check outNaruto’s team in action.
 Now then… Show me whatyou’ve learned until now!
 Go!
 All right! Formation One, Konohamaru!
 Sexy Jutsu!
 Adults are a cinch with this Jutsu.
 You idiot!
 You wish, Brother Naruto!
 Times are evolving!
 New formation!
 – Cheesecake Jutsu!– Cheesecake Jutsu!
 Fashion Model!
 Movie Star!
 Tanning Salon Receptionist!
 – We're Cheesecakes!– We're Cheesecakes!
 I’d like to say, just whatI’d expect of my best pupils,
 but you still don’t haveenough “bust-waist-hip.”
 Jeez…This guy’s such a pain…as always.
 Iruka Sensei!
 What is it?
 A report from the observatory…
 Wow… It’s warm…
 Good thing we listened to youand prepared it ahead of time.
 We would’ve been soaked if
 we were even a little slowputting up the tent!
 Reading ahead is important fora Ninja…
 In particular, if you don’t acutelysense the weatherr,
 it could end up being fatal,so be careful.
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 What’re you doing, Moegi?Pull it properly, believe it!
 I’ve had it!I don’t want to do this!
 Moegi! Stop saying selfish thingsand hold it!
 But…
 What, really?!
 It seems it’s going to directly hitthe Leaf Village before dawn…
 Jeez, why now…?!
 The communication fromthe observatory
 was probably delayed due to the storm.
 We have no choice, then…
 The training is suspended.
 Convey the order to allthe teams immediately!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Why’d you put the tent away?!
 Brother Naruto, what’s the deal?
 This path isn’t on the map.
 We fell behind the others morethan I thought.
 We can’t be resting
 Then, this path…
 Yeah… It’s not on the map.lt’s a shortcut route!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Will this be okay?!
 What’re you doing?!We’ll be late if we don’t hurry!
 Don’t talk nonsense!
 We haven’t learned that methodof climbing!
 Right! Chakra control comes afterwe’ve become senior students!
 That makes no difference.You can do anything if you get serious!
 Come on! Let’s go!
 Damn it…!
 Grab on!
 Wh-What’re you doing?!
 Oh! Let go, Konohamaru!
 If I let go, he’ll blow away!
 Let go of the bag, Udon!
 I-I can’t…!
 It can’t be helped…
 No! I can’t hold on any longer!
 That was a close one!
 I issued an evacuation advisory
 to all the teams encampedat the foot of the mountain.
 I see… Now all that’s left isNaruto’s team…
 Iruka Sensei!
 I found this on an unplanned route…
 An unplanned route, you say?!
 What do we do now?We’ve lost our tent and our food…
 There’s no point in saying that!
 What?! It’s because you put your footon my backpack in the first place…
 What’re you talking about?!
 If my foot hadn’t gotten caught,we would’ve blown away.
 Now, now…Stop fighting, believe it.
 Why didn’t you close the zipper, Udon?!
 Sorry…
 Now, now…Don’t say that, Konohamaru!
 When you get right down to it,
 it’s your fault for entering a strange route,Brother Naruto!
 Right, right!
 What?
 We got behind because
 you got caught in a trapand were lost forever!
 Hey, what did you say?!
 You can’t justify yourself, can you?!
 We could’ve gotten through fasterif you guys hadn’t gotten in the way!
 It’s because our leader’snot dependable!
 What?!
 Heh! How silly!
 – What did you say?!– What did you say?!
 What?!
 Ohh… I’m hungry…Temporary ceasefire.
 This is the spot.
 That Naruto…
 After all I told him aboutfollowing instructions!
 Taking the direction of the windunder consideration,
 they’re above here, I guess…
 Okay, let’s go, Shikamaru.
 Right.
 What’s this?!
 It’s all stuff we need hot water for…
 About the only thing we can eatis the baumkuchen cake…
 I’m hungry…
 You’re asking too much!
 This is survival,
 so it’s common sense to have things readythat can be eaten right away!
 Right, right!
 I won’t share if you’re going to complain!
 I’m taking the big one.
 The biggest one…is mine!
 The big one… The big one…
 Okay, eat up!
 What…? But…
 It’s divided in three?
 You’re not having any here,Brother Naruto?
 Back in the day,
 I also went without food oncewhen I screwed up during training.
 We couldn’t all pull togetherand Kakashi Sensei got mad at us…
 Cripes! Who cares aboutthree working as one?!
 It's called teamwork.
 I figured it out at that time.
 The important thing fora Ninja isn’t rules or codes,
 but teamwork acting forthe sake of comrades…
 Here.
 Sakura…
 Brother Naruto…
 Well as for me,I don’t like sweets, so!
 – Oh… 					– Oh…
 You’re one to talkhaving bought it yourself!
 Your stomach growled.
 You have some too, Brother Naruto!
 It’s pretty slippery.You okay, Shikamaru?
 Yeah…
 Damn it… How could that Narutotake such a dangerous route?!
 Jeez… He’s always causingsome kind of trouble.
 What a pain he is…
 It seems they were hereuntil just a little while ago…
 He really does cause…trouble.
 The finish line is rightbefore our eyes!
 That method of climbing isn’t fair,I tell you!
 Right! I knew we shouldn’t haveshared the food!
 What is it, Udon?
 What’re you doing?We’ll leave you behind!
 Something’s…coming…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 R-Run while you can!
 G-Got it!
 H-Hurry it up…
 Brother Naruto!
 – Brother Naruto!– Brother Naruto!
 Brother! Brother Naruto!Hang in there!
 What should we do, Konohamaru?!
 We’ll go help him…
 But…it looks likeit'll crumble again!
 Brother Naruto!Let’s go, Udon, Moegi!
 Are you awake, Brother Naruto?!
 That was close. So I made it intoa space between the rocks, huh…?
 We’re coming to help!
 Idiot! Run, quick!
 Konohamaru…
 We can’t do it…Let’s call for help--
 Brother said it before!
 The important thing fora Ninja is teamwork!
 Konohamaru, you…
 No! If I move even a little,the support rock will give way
 and you guys will end upgetting entangled in this!
 Brother Naruto! Have you forgottenwhat you yourself said?
 You can do anything…
 …if you get serious!
 You guys…
 Konohamaru Gang!Help Brother Naruto!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 Be careful!
 Easy does it!
 Yeah.
 But hurry.
 It moved…Time it right andtoss it away in one shot.
 Got it!
 One, two…!
 Yes!
 It’s a big success!
 We did it, we did it!
 That was a close one…
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 You guys okay?
 Iruka Sensei! Shikamaru!
 Naruto! Above you!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Run towards Shikamaru!
 – Brother Naruto!– Brother Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Rasengan!
 Naruto…
 Man, making us get all nervous…
 Excellent, Brother Naruto…
 Thank goodness!
 Yeah!
 So, what’s the meaning of this?
 So you see…
 It was all Brother Naruto’s orders!
 We were opposed,
 but he forced us to move aheadsaying the only way to finish first
 was to take a dangerous shortcut!
 I said many times we shouldn’tbecause it’s dangerous!
 But…
 – Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!– Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!
 What…? What?
 It seems that’s about the size of it…You’re prepared, right, Naruto?
 Say…
 Since when did your teamworkget so good?
 Naruto!
 I’ve had it with lectures!
 Hey, wait! Naruto!
 Wait!
 So many things happenon this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed,your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times whenI just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart,I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Across the verdant wildcame the slender giant!

 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,

 A Limitless Supply of Ninja Tools
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 You’ve come back, Choji!
 Yay!
 Are you okay, Naruto!
 I’m okay, but I’m not okaywith your heavy weight!
 I’ll get him right away!
 Stop it Choji!lt doesn’t work on him!
 What?
 This water absorbs all the shocks andit gives me an iron-wall defense.
 Oh, really?
 Shoot!
 Flower Ninja Art: Bloom!Myriad of Flowers!
 I’m saved.
 Where’d that guy go?!
 After a bonfire, you should put it out.
 There is a limit to your Kunai Knife,
 but my water that the earthgives me is infinite.
 His Ninjutsu is endless.So for now…
 Wanna run away?
 Say that you’ll withdraw!
 You can’t get away.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 After them!
 This way!
 If you get caught by that water,it’s over for sure!
 It’s coming around fromthis side too.
 It’s trying to trap us!
 Run! Run! You’re all going toget eaten if you get caught!
 At this rate, we’re eventuallygoing to be defeated.
 Looks like we’ve gotta beat him up,after all.
 But how are we going to beat him
 if the attack doesn’t work on him?
 Damn!
 Huh?
 Don't you thinkthere's something weird about him?
 Wh-What is?
 Hmm… I wonder?
 Don’t be joking at a time like this!
 Perhaps, is Naruto talkingabout his tonfa?
 Oh yeah, he’s holding his tonfalike a dowsing rod.
 That’s it!
 It’s called dousing.
 If you concentrate on the itemyou’re looking for,
 it will react to that item and inform youwhen you get near it.
 Dowsing?
 I see! Naruto, Choji!
 We might have a chance to win!
 Huh?
 If that tonfa is the secret ofthis Jutsu then…
 Naruto!
 Let’s rap up the chase!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Idiot.
 I’m not going to let you get away!
 I've got you!
 Seems like you tried to get close to me,but too bad
 Damn it!
 I’m going to preparea special one for you.
 Wh-What Naruto?
 Hurry up and run, Choji!
 Yurinojou!
 Yurinojou! Choji!
 Choji!
 Behind you!Look behind you!
 I said look behind you!
 Choji!
 Choji!
 The fight is over.
 First, the big one,I’ll eat you first.
 Certainly the fight is over.
 A fight where you’re going to lose.
 What?!
 Right now Choji!Drink up the water!
 Useless, useless.
 Water will gush out from the groundwith no limits.
 Why isn’t the water coming out?
 Like I said, it’s useless.
 What happened?!
 The water that will protectyou will not come out of here.
 Look carefully at the surroundings..
 Yes, water does not come outof this craggy place.
 I’m full!
 Yurinojou has realized your secret.
 I also thought something was strange.
 When I went to check the trap,
 I decided to take the shortest routethrough the craggy area.
 It wouldn’t have been strangeto run into you there…
 but that didn’t happen.
 The answer to that is easy!
 You made a detour becauseyou avoided craggy areas
 where the water wouldn’t come out.
 The tonfa you hold is a weapon
 and was a way to find the waterthrough dowsing.
 You lost them and you went awayfrom your advantageous places.
 You mean… The reason whyyou cracked my tonfa was…
 Of course, it wasn’t a coincidence.
 It was planned by Yurinojou whocalculated your actions.
 Damn it…!
 This one will be heavy becauseof the water!
 Human Boulder!
 You did it! Choji!
 Yurinojou!
 My ribs are injured, but…I’m okay.
 But there should be three of them,so hurry and get the princess!
 I got it!
 Choji, please take care of Yurinojou.
 Okay!
 I’ll catch up to Hinata!
 Let me rest a little.
 I got it.
 Let’s wait for everyone here.
 There’s no need to wait.
 After we rest a little, you are goingto take me to a safe place.
 But Naruto and the others are not yet…
 That doesn’t matter!
 In the first place, everything becamelike this because of you guys.
 Instead of taking the long way,
 if we had used the merchant peopleas decoys,
 then we would have escaped by now!
 Decoys…?But Kikusuke has already…
 What about it?
 If your mission as Ninja is to riskyour life in the line of duty,
 then Kikunojou should be satisfied.
 Even though Kikunojou is dead,
 if I am still alive, then it’s possible torevive the Land of the Green.
 Princess.
 Hinata, you won’t understand howI was separated from my parents
 to be held as hostage ina foreign country
 and how much I was bullied.
 I realized then that only fools would expectto live off of human compassion.
 Especially someone like Naruto
 who is easily influenced bypeople’s emotions
 should be disqualified as a Ninja.
 He loses his rationality in his goal.
 Princess, what do you knowabout Naruto?
 Naruto has lived without his parentssince he was a child.
 He has always lived alone.
 To be accepted by everyone,to become the next Hokage…
 he has worked hard…really hard…
 Despite all that, he didn’t give up
 and he would never think ofliving at the expense of others.
 He tried and tried.
 Naruto and I are in different positions.
 I’m sorry. You’re right, Princess.
 Hinata… Do you like Naruto?
 I understand.
 Let’s wait for everyone here.
 Princess…
 That bag must be heavy.
 I will relieve youof some of the burden.
 Oh, thanks.
 I cannot die in a place like this.
 Don’t you look nice, Ruiga.
 Jiga… Help me… Brother…
 Whatever.
 If you die, Brother Renga and I couldsplit the Land of Green’s profits.
 Jiga…
 Don’t blame me.
 W-Wait!
 S-Stop Jiga…!
 Hinata!
 Hinata.
 N-Naruto…
 Where is the Princess?
 That’s what I was going to ask!
 I said let’s wait here and the minuteI turned around…
 Why does a Ninja like youget beaten by an amateur?
 S-Sorry.
 Then right now she should be alone…
 Naruto, we should first go backto the village
 and get advice from the Hokage.
 No!There’s no time for that.
 There are still two Janin left.
 She’ll get killed if she gets caught.
 But this really isn’t an official mission.
 We might not be able tohandle the other two…
 You’re right…
 As you say, this may not bean official mission but…
 she’s trying really hard to escapeby herself right now.
 The things she says and doesmay be wrong,
 but somehow,I can’t leave her alone.
 Naruto, I’ll also…
 Hinata!
 Yurinojou got hurt.
 You and Choji,please take care of Yurinojou!
 See you later!
 Oh!
 Be careful, Naruto…
 Right there!
 I see, you have good instincts.
 I’ll praise you for getting Ruiga.
 Are you the second Janin?
 Oh, I feel honored that you knowabout me.
 Then you should brag about itin the other world.
 That Mr. Jiga killed you,so it couldn’t be helped.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 What?
 That wouldn’t work.
 This guy…
 What kind of Ninjutsu is he using?
 A Hidden Leaf Ninja, huh?How interesting.
 I’ll put them down asone of my next targets.
 I won’t let you do that!
 How did…?
 Yup.
 My Ninjutsu is Ninja Art Magnet.
 It’s like this!
 I will live, no matter what…
 This is your graveyard.
 I will return those wordsright back at you.
 You!
 Then.
 There!
 Damn! 					What’s going on?!
 What should I do?I can't find Choji.
 I'm sure that he's somewherehiding his presence, but…
 This is… Naruto’s forehead band.
 Naruto…
 I grew up drinking iron.
 That’s why I can use the iron
 that has accumulated in my bodyand turn myself into a magnet.
 This rocky mountain containslots of iron,
 making it my invincible battle-field.
 Change yourself into magnet…?
 By the way, I could also changethe things I touch into magnets.
 I’ve already changed the rocks behind youinto powerful magnets.
 So what are you trying to do?!
 I mean this!Ninja Art Magnet: Infinite Meteors!
 Second hit! Third hit!
 Naruto!
 Your friend… I’ll take good care of her.
 Hinata! Don’t come!
 He is…
 He is…a dangerous…opponent…
 Naruto!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 What should I do?
 My Gentle Fist won’t work againsthis Ninja Art.
 It’s frustrating, but I can’t win against himif I fight him head on.
 At this rate, Naruto will…
 No, no, I won’t let that happen.
 I will discover the weaknessof his Jutsu.
 I won’t give up!I’ll stop him, no matter what!
 Next time:“The Byakugan Sees the Blind Spot!”
 I’m going to risk everythingin this single attack!

 …about the amount of sandinside the gourd.
 Gaara of the Desert…A dopey nickname.
 You can’t do anythingif you don’t have sand.
 Going to the trouble of walking aroundcarrying heavy sand
 is the very proof of that.
 Sand Shower…
 How trite…
 As long as I have sand,I can do anything.
 You’re the one who’s dopey…
 It’s easy for me to do thingslike create sand with dirt…
 I get it…
 With his own sand he grinds thingslike rocks and minerals in dirt
 and makes it into sand.
 So he was sending his own sandbeneath the ground
 and adding new sand, huh…?
 Gaara of the Desert…
 His nickname isn’t just for display.
 Excellent!
 You did it!
 Not yet.
 Sand Burial!
 I’m reminded of that manwhen I look at that guy.
 Huh?
 Sasuke Uchiha!
 He had the same eyesas that guy…
 The same eyes?
 Wanting to verify the valueof one’s own existence…
 Such eyes…
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke.
 You’re here, aren’t you?!At least answer me!
 What’s gotten into you?!
 I don’t hate the darkness…
 The darkness is whereI was brought up…
 Why am I…in a place like this?
 Did I do something wrong?
 Is there really God…?
 If there is, why confine mein a place like this?
 Who’s there?
 It doesn’t matter who I am…Get out!
 Kimimaro, the time has come to use you…
 Huh?
 For our sake,for the Kaguya Clan…
 Fight!
 Yes… To fight.
 That is…
 the only thing I can do now.
 N-No way…
 That’s quite some pressure…
 I would’ve been flattenedjust like that
 had I not made a membraneof bone just below the skin.
 Bones…That guy’s a monster, too.
 It’s a troublesome body, isn’t it?
 I underestimated you…
 But, I won’t be caught byyour sand anymore.
 Sand Tsunami!
 Wow… It’s beyondthe scope of
 escaping from the sandor not getting caught…
 To think it would changethe terrain itself…
 You…You did it.
 Not yet.
 Giant Sand Burial!
 H-He’s so strong…
 He’s gotten even strongerthan when he fought me.
 But…this time for sure…
 He’s a persistent guy…
 Huh?!
 I’m still…alive…
 Then… There’s still significancefor me to live.
 From now, we’re goingto launch a night attack
 on the Hidden Mist Village…
 As they are disconcertedfrom that incident,
 now is the perfect time for usto make them realize our ferocity!
 Make them realize the ferocityof the Kaguya Clan!
 – Yeah! 					– Right!
 What’re you doing, Kimimaro?Get going!
 I don’t know what to do…
 You don’t need to thinkdeeply about it.
 Go down to the Hidden Mist Village
 and kill every last personyou encounter!
 Just act on your instincts!
 Are you of the Hidden Mist Village?
 No…
 I-I see… Excuse me!
 Haku?
 Oh…no. It’s nothing, Zabuza.
 We don’t have time to be stopping.Let’s hurry!
 Right!
 He had the same eyes as I…
 Before I met Zabuza…
 Hold it!
 You’re a hasty one, aren’t you?I’m not from this village.
 The thing you are after is right there…
 Now, go.
 It seems to have begun…
 The Kaguya Clan…
 Fools who can only findtheir own path of life by fighting…
 It was long ago
 when a simple-minded group thatjust enjoyed slaughtering was acceptable.
 With a governed organizationas an opponent,
 they just become foolsrushing towards death
 if they fight only with power…
 Are we the only survivors…?
 It seems we’re surrounded…
 The defense was tighterthan we thought.
 We have no choice…
 Now it’s come to this,
 take along with youevery person you can!
 We’ll have them entertain usas much as possible!
 What do I fight for…?
 What am I…?
 Without knowing anything,I just kept on fighting.
 The time has come to use you…
 I’m needed…
 That was the only thingthat got my body moving.
 And…
 I was also able to figure out that…
 I couldn’t live if I didn’t fight.
 Dawn broke…
 And I learned that…
 I myself was the only oneto survive.
 Again, I’m all alone…
 By myself, I just wanderedaimlessly from place to place.
 This is…
 The flower, from back then…?
 Why are you bloomingin a place like this?
 Why won’t you answer?
 You’re ignoring me, too, huh?!
 There’s no way you’d be seenby someone in a place like this, yet you…!
 That’s enough…
 Maybe…there’s no significance to living.
 But you might be able todiscover something interesting
 by continuing to live…right?
 Like how you discovered that flower…
 Like how I discovered you.
 Okay, Let’s go…
 Back then…Lord Orochimaru said that, but…
 People are born withsome kind of significance.
 That’s what I think…some kind of important mission.
 The mission for me…
 is to protect Lord Orochimaruand his ambition.
 What’s…that?!
 Come back, Sasuke!Everyone’s worried about you!
 Damn it…lt’s so dark I can’t see anything!
 You’ve got better eyes than me.
 Sasuke is in the darkness now…
 N-Neji?!
 You’ll be unable to catch upwith Sasuke
 if you stop in a place like this…
 Neji!
 Yeah… You’re right!This isn’t the time to stop.
 Just wait! I’ll take Sasukeback home no matter what!
 Sasuke!
 Sand Coffin!
 That form…?!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 I’m saved. That’s excellent.
 To think you could do such a thing!
 He was persistent,but this is the end…184.01	01:47:58:14	01:48:00:16	He’ll never come out again.
 Brainwashed by Orochimaru…
 It’s not brainwashing!That person understands me!
 What do you guys know?!

 Water Style!
 – Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
 The same Jutsu as me?!
 Why have you shown up too?
 Well…I asked you to take careof them earlier.
 But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
 What business doesa Rogue Ninja like you
 have in this village now?
 Kakashi Hatake…
 Eye to Eye: Sharingan vs. Sharingan
 What?! Why?! Why?!
 Why do I have to go on a research tripwith you, Pervy Sage?
 Oh no, this isn’t just any research trip.
 There’s a woman whose dataI want to collect.
 So we have to look for her first.
 I really don’t have time to accompany youon your perverted research trip!
 Because I have training!
 Hm? Training?
 I will take lessons from Kakashi Senseiand learn a variety of things, like Chidori!
 Kakashi Sensei has beenplaying favorites lately!
 Well, I think that techniqueis impossible for you to learn.
 More importantly…That woman is really beautiful.
 You want to meet her, don’t you?!
 Not at all.
 I’m not some kid who canbe cajoled by you, Pervy Sage!
 Anyway, no!
 Well, it can’t be helped…
 Oh, well… I know Jutsu more amazingthan Chidori, but…
 It can’t be helped…Maybe I’ll take Sasuke?
 Of course I’ll go!
 I’ll pack my bags right away.
 Pervy Sage, don’t move!
 I’ll be darned… He’s really a cute kid.
 Those eyes are exactly the sameas they used to be in the past.
 That being said,he is a true inheritor of the Sharingan…
 I have to assume the worst-case scenario,just in case.
 This is a surprise…No wonder you copied my Jutsu…
 So there really is a fellowbesides Itachi who has that eye.
 Your name is Kakashi,the Copy Ninja, wasn’t it?
 I’m the one who was surprised.
 I saw strange men in the tea houseand wondered who they were…
 There they were Itachi Uchiha and…
 the Mystery Man of Hidden Mist Village,Kisame Hoshigaki.
 Well, well… You know even my name.lt’s an honor.
 I see. You’re one of the“Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.”
 That huge sword is the “Shark Skin,” right?
 I heard that kid Zabuzahad it out with you?
 Yeah…
 You are someone who’swell worth lopping off…
 Stop it… Kisame.
 If you were to go at it with that man,it won’t end without cost.
 And if you spend too much time,another Shinobi would come running.
 However…
 Don’t lose sight of the goal…You didn’t come here to get injured!
 Let me hear that “goal” then…?
 Just came to find somethingwe’re looking for.
 Something you’re looking for?
 The thing you’re looking for…What is it?
 I’m different from Kisame,I won’t take time.
 Ninja Art: Water Style.Water wall!
 That’s some Jutsu speed.My eyes couldn’t follow the Sign.
 That Shuriken in the right handwas a decoy…
 to use a Water Style Jutsu to launchan attack below my foot …
 That’s what to expect from you, Kakashi.
 Your power of analytical eye…is great.
 A Shadow Clone?!His Jutsu speed is too fast!
 A water clone?!
 The Copy Ninja has done well this farwith Jutsu of my village.
 Nice! Kakashi!
 Get down, Kurenai!
 This one is the Shadow Clone…
 Huh?
 Kakashi! Kurenai!
 He made the Shadow Clonebody explode?!
 A new Jutsu, a new Jutsu.
 Sakura’s going to start to like me…
 Maybe!
 Kakashi Sensei and Sasukewill be surprised!
 Kakashi…!
 Don’t lower your guard…
 He’s the guy who became a division chiefof Anbu Black Ops at 13 years old…
 To think he’s this powerful…
 No, you haven’t seenthis guy’s strength yet.
 I didn’t expect that you who are nota member of the Uchiha clan
 would have masteredthe Sharingan to that extent…
 But your body isn’t the “Uchiha clan” bodythat goes with the eye.
 That’s right. As a result,my stamina doesn't last…
 There’s a reason why the Uchiha Clanwas deemed the strongest and feared…
 I’ll demonstrate the true strengthof Sharingan, the Kekkei Genkai!
 I-It can’t be!
 This is bad!
 Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes!
 Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes!
 Both of you,absolutely do not open your eyes…
 It’s all over now if your eyes meet.
 Only people with Sharingancan have a go with that technique.
 Indeed with Sharingan,
 you can resist this Mangekyo Sharinganto a certain extent.
 However…
 this special Visual Jutsu of Sharingan,
 Genjutsu: Tsukuyomi, Nightmare Realm,is unbreakable.
 The only person who can bring me downis someone
 using the same Kekkei Genkai,a Sharingan user…
 Sasuke…
 I wonder how much you can takewithout the Kekkei Genkai?
 The one just now was…Genjutsu?
 In the world of Tsukuyomi…
 Both space and time…
 and mass…I control them all.
 For the next 72 hours…
 I’ll stab you continually with swords.
 That’s…
 In the world of Tsukuyomi…
 Both space and time…
 and mass…I control them all.
 Calm down… This is Genjutsu.
 It’s best not to be optimisticand think it’s an illusion.
 This pain is not an illusion.
 This pain is absolutelyno different from reality.
 How long will your spirit sustain?
 There’s…71 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds left.
 Wha…?!
 S-Since then…?!
 That’s all the time that has passed?!
 What happened, Kakashi?!
 Are you saying we should keepour eyes closed still?!
 N-Not…yet…
 What happened?!
 Just as that guy finished speaking,you suddenly fell over!
 Three days in that world is less thana moment in the actual world, huh…
 But…why doesn’t he kill me?
 He could easily do so, if he wants to…
 Whoa…To take that Jutsu without causinghis spirit to collapse.
 But Itachi…
 it’s also dangerous for youto overuse those eyes.
 The thing you’re looking for…
 is it Sasuke?
 No…the legacy of the Fourth Hokage…
 These guys.What the heck are they planning…?
 So, Naruto, is it…?
 It’s been a long time…
 How many years has it beensince you returned to the village?
 Kakashi…
 I will keep Naruto under my care.
 It was an understandable decisionof the Third Hokage
 who appointed you tothe role of watching over Naruto…
 But even at your level,you may not be able to handle it properly.
 What in the world are you saying?
 I’ve been observing Orochimaruever since he left the village…
 It was obvious that he would returnto this village sooner or later.
 All told, at first I was concernedonly about him, but…
 What is it?
 The guy joined an organization.
 An organization?
 What are the details of the organization?
 I don’t know much of the details,
 but it’s a small organization knownas Akatsuki made up of nine Shinobi.
 Until recently, they weren’t makingany dramatic moves
 except some cloak-and-dagger activities.
 The biggest concern isthe members of that organization.
 Almost all of them are listedon the Bingo Book,
 all S-rank deviant criminals.
 That Itachi is among them.
 If the nine of them get together,their intent will not be volunteer activities.
 Since you’ve been told this much,you already know what it means.
 But recently, Orochimaru pulled outof the organization.
 And at that time,
 other members of the organizationwent in to action in different areas,
 in pairs gathering Jutsu and things.
 Is there proof that one of thosethings is the Nine-Tailed Fox?
 It’s possible.
 Because it’s one of the spiritswho possess the strongest Chakra…
 Kakashi…
 Sooner or later, that Naruto will haveto live watching his back…
 That’s his destiny.
 For now, you should keepyour eyes on Sasuke.
 It’s necessary for you to teach himhow to use his Sharingan.
 I’ll take care of Naruto for a while.
 The Nine-Tailed Fox inside Narutois your target?
 I know that you two aren’tthe only ones on the move…
 The name of your organization isAkatsuki, right?
 Akatsuki?
 Kisame! We’ll take Kakashi.Erase the other two.
 Severe Leaf Hurricanes!
 Who are you?
 The Leaf’s noble, blue fierce animal…
 Mighty Guy!
 What a sight…Shouldn’t you be called a strange beast?
 Don’t underestimate that man…
 That man is Itachi!
 You did this to Kakashi…?
 Don’t look at Itachi’s eyes, Guy!You’ll be caught up in his Jutsu!
 I know that already!
 In order to fight Kakashi,I devised ways to battle the Sharingan.
 Open your eyes, both of you!
 B-But…
 When you battle with the Sharingan,
 it’s not a problem ifyou don’t look at those eyes!
 You work around it bygaining insight into his movements
 by looking constantly at his feet.
 Now that you mention it,you’re probably right, but…
 You’re the only one who can do that.
 That’s true…
 There’s a knack to reading
 all of your opponents’ movementsonly by his feet.
 But I can’t teach it to youin this emergency.
 Just get used it right now!
 What should we do?
 Kurenai, get Kakashi to the medical team.
 Asuma, you are my back-up!
 Okay!
 And until the reinforcements ofAnbu Black Ops I arranged for arrive,
 I will hang out with you guys.
 Interesting…That’s some nerve…
 Kisame… Pull the plug.
 We didn’t come to have a war.
 It’s too bad,but no more of this nonsense.
 We’re leaving.
 Too bad… I was finally feeling motivated.
 It can’t be helped.
 All right!
 Here I go!
 Y-You’re putting too much spirit into it.
 You’re not training on a mountain retreat,you know that, right?
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered,let us stay true
 Over and over,we hung on without giving up
 Over and over,we kept coming back up
 Over and over,we believed and dreamed
 Over and over,we've seen fools
 There's a super beautifulyoung lady over there!
 She just winked at us!
 Look, Naruto!She must be interested in us!
 She may be cuter than Sakura!
 – All right, Naruto!– Yeah!
 Go back, train,then go to bed.
 You always do that to me!
 Next time: ""Jiraiya:Naruto's Potential Disaster!""
 What are we gonna doabout my training?!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 I’ll show you there are walls
 which effort alone cannever break through.
 Sakura Blossoms!
 Huh?!
 Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
 But our Jutsu exceeds thatand is the speed of sound!
 Lee!
 My left ear...
 There’s a little gimmick I have.
 Evading won’t work...on my attacks.
 What is he going to do?!
 It’s sound.
 Even though you evaded my fist,sound assaulted you.
 Sound?
 Do you know what sound isall about in the first place?
 Vibration?
 Correct. In other words,hearing sounds means,
 that the eardrum iscatching vibrating air.
 And the human eardrum breakswith sounds over 150 Mhz.
 Also, by assaulting the semicircular canalwhich is located even deeper,
 I can make you totally lose balance.
 You won’t be able to move your bodyfreely for sometime.
 Something old and tiredlike Taijutsu don’t work on us.
 Well, you were doing goodup to a certain point,
 but I brought forth my Jutsu.
 It’s just not gonna work anymore.
 I freely manipulate ultrasonic wavesand air pressure,
 and have the power toobliterate even boulders!
 Primary Lotus!
 I can send air into the ground
 and change the dirt intoa cushion as I please.
 It’s different fromyour silly Jutsu.
 Blast it!
 Lee, it is all right to usethis Jutsu
 to protect someone precious.
 Protect... someone precious?
 In any case,
 I’m impressed that youwere able to master it, little man!
 You did it quite well, Lee!
 Darn it!
 Okay, then!
 Next is...
 You!
 Darn it!
 He’s coming!
 What?!
 No way!
 Lee!
 Leaf...
 Hurricane!
 It looks like my earlier attackis having an effect!
 I’m somewhat surprised...
 but there’s not even a trace ofthat flash of combo Taijutsu you showed!
 This arm amplifies soundsfrom within to its maximum.
 It’s a speaker of sorts!
 Lee!
 And the assault sound isn’t limitedby the direction of my arm...
 it always converges onthe targeted prey by my Chakra!
 Lee!
 Now then... 					The final blow.
 I won’t let you!
 Oh, well.
 Hey, let’s get outta here!
 Those guys are pretty dangerous!
 It looks like Sasuke and Narutoare only unconscious, but...
 even that guy Lee’s beenmessed up and Sakura’s alone.
 What’re you gonna do, Ino?
 What do you mean?
 Well, Sakura’s in deep trouble!
 You’re all right with that?
 Huh?!
 You two were once close friends,weren’t you?
 By the way...
 What Sakura, don’t be so stiff!
 Well...
 Ino, I hear you also...
 What is it?
 ...like Sasuke.
 Then, that means from now on,
 you and I are rivals.
 Why... why am I recalling thingsfrom that time?
 Hey, Ino!
 What’re you gonna do?!
 I know, but there’s nothing I can do!
 I can’t heedlesslygo out there, can I?!
 Even if I went out now...
 I’d be taken down without a doubt.
 I also...
 I also...!
 Air pressure!The shurikens got bounced back?!
 Your hair’s shinier than mine.
 Hey! If you have time to worryabout your hair,
 you should practice!
 Getting all spiced up like a woman...
 Why don’t you kill that Sasuke guyright in front of this sexy bug, Zaku?
 Yeah! That sounds great!
 Hey hey...
 I won’t let you do such a thing!
 Don’t move!
 Sakura.
 My body... It has no strength.
 I...
 Again... I’m just pulling everyone’s feet!
 I’m always being protected.
 It's so frustrating!
 This time for sure...I had thought!
 This time for sure...
 I must protect people precious to me...so I thought!
 So...
 Let’s do this!
 Hey! Sasuke and Naruto aregonna get it, too!
 W-What should I do?!
 That’s pointless!
 That won’t work on me!
 What are you saying?
 Huh?
 What?!
 I always...
 act as if I’m a full-fledged Ninja.
 I always say that I like Sasuke.
 I always act like I know everythingand lecture Naruto.
 I always just... watch them from behind.
 And yet...
 Tazuna, get back!
 Get back!
 Now then...
 Let’s get wild!
 This is the only way totake him down!
 Sasuke!
 Here it is!
 Those two always coveredmy back and fought for me.
 Lee, you say that you like me...
 I’ll protect you until I die!
 Primary Lotus!
 With me at your back...
 you risked your life andfought for me.
 I have a feeling that you taught me...
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 Humph!
 I want to be like all of you!
 This time...
 I want all of you...
 to watch me...
 ...from behind!
 Sakura?
 Sakura...
 Kin! Kill her!
 Huh! That sign...
 Substitution Jutsu!
 On the right, huh?You think I’m a fool?
 With such a simple and basic Ninjutsu...
 you think you can come at me?!
 Kin, get out of the way!
 Useless!
 Air pressure 100 percent,ultrasonic waves 0%, output...
 Is that all you can do?
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 You’re easy to spot...
 You’re above!
 I’ve said it two or three times thatthat won’t work!
 This is enough... for you!
 Where next?
 Huh?!
 What...?!
 This time... it’s not a substitution!
 Get off me! Hey!
 Sakura...

 Who’re you?
 I’m called Ino Yamanaka.How ‘bout you?
 I’m... Sakura.
 Huh? I can’t hear you.Say it louder.
 Sakura Haruno!
 Huh, I see.
 You have a wide forehead.
 So, Billboard Brow, huh...?
 That’s why you hideyour forehead with your bangs.
 Like a ghost...
 Sakura, was it?
 Uh-huh...
 Come back here tomorrow.
 I’ll give you something nice.
 Huh?
 Darn, let go!
 See! You look cuter like this, Sakura!
 I’ll give you that ribbon.
 T-Thanks.
 But...
 But what?
 My forehead...
 You hide it, so people makemore fun of you, you know?!
 You have a cute face Sakura,so you should be more confident!
 More confident!

 Hey, who’s that?Who’s she, Ino?
 Her name’s Sakura.
 Hey, say hello!
 Hello...
 Listen everybody! Listen!
 There’s someone I like!Who do you think it is?
 Hurry up and tell us!
 Don’t say it’s Sasuke?
 Huh? Why’d you know?
 What’re you talking about?
 Sasuke’s really popular,he’s the most popular!
 Huh? Is that so?
 Oh no! I’ll have a lot of rivals.What should I do?!
 Hey, Ino! Sakura’s been upbeat lately!
 She’s just acting braveand romping around!
 Ino! I’ve heard Sasukelikes girls with long hair.
 ...likes girls with long hair....likes girls with long hair.
 Sakura...
 I’ve heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino.
 From now on, we’re rivals.
 Your hair. It’s grown quite a bit.
 Ino...
 Why...
 Why are you on thesame team as Sasuke?!
 I will not lose anymore... to you, Ino!
 Me too! I won’t lose to you, Sakura.No matter what!
 ...Sakura!
 I will...
 I will...
 Give it up!
 It’s really bad...
 Hey, Ino...!
 I must... protect everyone!
 You punk!
 Huh?
 Huh! More strange ones.
 Ino...?
 Sakura! I promisedI wouldn’t lose to you, didn’t I?!
 Hey, can you hear it?

 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Wow! This is Ino team’s battle?!
 What a formation based on calculations!
 I hate to admit it,but they’re strong!
 Even the Sound Village oneswould be no match for them!
 We’ll protect Sasuke...
 Huh?! What’s this feeling?

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Umm, where’s the roomthat Sasuke’s in?
 Mr. Sasuke is not allowedany visitors.
 What?! Hey, hey!What's up with that?!
 I’m sorry,those are the rules.
 Why, Sis, tell me why?
 Naruto, this is a hospital.Keep it down.
 Say! Say!I've got a favor to ask!
 You don’t need to say it all.
 Well, I thought it wouldcome to this so…
 I searched for someoneto watch your training.
 Why?!
 I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
 I have some mattersto take care of.
 I don’t have time totrouble myself with you.
 Oh! Aha...!
 You’re going totrain Sasuke, aren’t you?!
 Well... don't say that.
 I found a sensei who’smore reliable than I am!
 Well…who is it?
 It’s me!
 Huh?!
 Oh!
 You!
 The Closet Perv!
 Such insolence!
 Ebisu Returns:Naruto's Toughest Training Yet!
 Ebisu Sensei isa Closet Perv?
 Why’s this guymy training teacher?!
 In the first place,he’s weaker than me!
 What did you say?
 But you see! But you see!
 A long time ago,with my Harem Jutsu, this guy…
 Transform!
 Master Ebisu! Master Ebisu!
 B-By any chance…
 Harem Jutsu?
 U-Uh…it’s nothing!
 I’ll treat you to and buy youwhatever you want later!
 Just be quiet about that!
 You better.
 Wow, I didn’t know youwere acquainted.
 Well, they’re unsavory ties, but.
 How could I ever forgetthat humiliation?
 But why this guy?
 I definitely don’t want him to.
 Same here.
 If it weren’t Kakashi’s favor,who’d teach you for the fun of it?
 Then don’t.
 Now now, both of you…
 Don’t say that.
 Naruto, Ebisu Sensei is a private tutor
 who teaches the elite,a special Jonin!
 He’s truly betterat teaching than I am.
 Well, Naruto, of the three kidsin Squad Seven that I taught,
 you’re the worst at the basic skills.
 Get taught with carethis time around.
 How the heck am I inferiorcompared to Sakura and Sasuke?!
 Naruto, it’s fact that youdon’t have the fundamentals down.
 No matter what you do,the basic skills are important.
 If you really want to become strong,just be quiet and listen to what I say.
 Now then, Ebisu Sensei,I’m leaving him with you.
 Yes, yes.
 Dang it.
 It may appear to be harsh,
 but you can become strongera lot more.
 Do your best.
 Okay, then, let’s go.
 Still, I’m not convinced…
 Huh?
 You see!
 Fundamentals might be important,
 but I won’t get strong being taughtby someone weaker than me!
 So in other words,you want to say that I’m weak?
 Who else is here?!
 I was certainly surprised havingthat indecent Jutsu used on me that time.
 But it’s premature for you tojudge my ability on just that.
 Even though you weretotally knocked out.
 Fine.
 Then, why don’t we putit to the test?
 Hmm?
 Naruto, run.
 Huh?
 If you can get to outrun me,I’ll back down quietly.
 Back down…?
 Yes.
 And of course, I’ll speak toKakashi Sensei
 about you receiving direct training.
 What?! Really?!
 This elite instructor does notgo back on his word.
 However, this is only ifyou can outrun me.
 Then that makes it easy!
 See ya!
 This’ll be a snap, a snap!
 I’ll lose that…Closet Perv in no time!
 He already can’t catch up!
 I knew I was quitean exceptional Ninja…
 Who is exceptional, you say?
 Surely you’re not thinking you canoutrun me with just that much.
 W-What’re you saying?!
 The chase has still…
 only just begun!
 Though he’s a Closet Perv,
 he’s the elite tutor after all,he’s good.
 Now then.
 I knew you were Closet Perv.
 What are you doing…?
 Naruto?
 I see. The idea isn’t bad.
 Then, how about this?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Heh!
 Catch me…if you can!
 Not bad…
 However, you are not the only onewho uses the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 I won’t let you get away!
 Dang it!
 Son…of…a...!
 Now then, next.
 Hold it!
 I found you!
 Wait!
 I won’t let you get away!
 Get off!
 There! No, actually, here!
 Here!
 There!
 There!
 Hold it!
 Have you reached your limit?
 You’re freaking pesky!
 Give it up already!
 What are you snappingback at me for?
 This is a chase, so chasingis natural, right?
 T-True enough…
 Naruto, you have understoodmy greatness by now, right?
 It’s about time you surrenderedand moved on to training--
 The heck with that!
 I’m going to bump you off,and receive Kakashi Sensei’s training!
 Even if I have to knock you out!
 It appears you still havesome spirit left.
 To think he would come at mehead on, even though this is a chase.
 Just what I would expect of you, Naruto.
 As Kakashi said, he’s thenumber one unpredictability Ninja.
 Don’t take this badly!
 Eat this!
 Clone Jutsu…?
 The game is over, Naruto!
 Dang it!
 Miso-flavor barbecued pork noodles andsalt-flavor ramen noodles!
 Here you go!
 Naruto, having been shownyour movements and
 having further analyzedwhat Kakashi has told me…
 it is clear that you cannot controlChakra well.
 Control…?
 That’s right.
 Now then, comparing youwith Sasuke and Sakura …
 I shall explain yourbad points in order.
 As you know, in the case of usingNinjutsu, Genjutsu and the like,
 Ninjas build up Chakra andactivate the Jutsu.
 I-I know that already!
 Is that so?
 Then, in the case of comparingthe three of you,
 I shall explain specificallyhow you are inferior.
 That’s kind of an irritatingway of saying it.
 I’m treating you the ramenas promised,
 so be quiet and listen!
 First, let us say that Sakurauses Clone Jutsu.
 Clone Jutsu!
 In her case, her build-up control as well asher control of Chakra is perfect,
 so she can make clones withoutusing wasteful energy.
 Cha!
 Next, in Sasuke’s case,
 he is somewhat poor atbuilding up Chakra.
 Clone Jutsu.
 But, his control of Chakra is perfect,
 so both he and Sakura canmake five clones.
 But, he uses a bit more wastefulChakra than Sakura.
 Oh!
 So Sasuke’s nothing special.
 In your case, there’s no timeto be laughing at others.
 Huh?
 You are very poor at building up Chakraand controlling it,
 so you cannot make cloneswith the same amount of Chakra.
 In the case where you strain tomake clones despite that,
 after consuming a much larger amountof Chakra than Sakura and Sasuke…
 Clone Jutsu!
 ...you can barely makeone clone at best.
 By the way,
 Sakura and Sasuke can become tenwith the same amount of Chakra.
 Like this, the three of you arethis different even using the same Jutsu.
 Well, this is a somewhat exaggeratedcomparison of you three,
 but you build up too much Chakra,use too much physical strength,
 and your Jutsu activation is also unstable.
 But, there’ve been times whenI was greater than Sakura and Sasuke…
 That’s only because youhappen to have
 the most outstanding staminaof the three!
 Well, I am pretty sure thatyour Chakra control
 is getting difficult due to the influenceof the Nine-Tails…
 which is the origin of your stamina.
 Anyway, there is no mistakingthat you can become strong
 if you carry out the trainingwe will be doing from now.
 Huh?! Really?!
 I guarantee it.
 Now then, let’s go.
 Sir, your bill.
 Oh, that’s right.
 Wha--?!
 Thank you very much!
 We’ve come quite a long way…
 But, this is a hot spring town, right?
 It doesn’t look like we’ve comehere to leisurely soak in a hot spring…
 Hey! Naruto!
 That’s the women’s bath!
 I simply will not allowindecent behavior!
 Huh?
 I’m not you…
 It’s not that I was trying to peep.Believe it!
 Thinking of something like thatin the first place makes you a Closet Perv!
 What’s with that look?
 N-Nothing.
 More importantly, why’ve we cometo a place like this?!
 Will soaking in a hot springdo anything for training?
 No!
 The training will be herein this hot spring area!
 Okay, this is the place.
 It’s a bath, sure enough!
 What are you saying?
 I said this is training, didn’t I?Training!
 We’re going to train here?
 What the heck are we going to do?
 Walk on this hot water!
 What?!
 What is it?
 Walk on hot water?
 Can you really do that?
 Of course!
 I heard from Kakashi Sensei.
 You already did tree-climbing trainingwithout using your hands, right?
 It’s an application of that.
 Hmm… 					What do you mean?
 Besides, I don’t really rememberstuff from long ago!
 In tree climbing, all you dois accumulate
 only the necessary amount of Chakrain one necessary location
 and maintain that amount ofChakra all the while.
 Trees are fixed objects,so you only need to be attached to it.
 In other words,
 it’s training for building upa fixed amount of Chakra.
 To float on the surface of water,
 you have to discharge ona constant basis
 an appropriate amount of Chakrafrom your feet to the water
 and balance that to the extent thatyou can float your own body.
 Huh?
 This Chakra control ismore difficult than maintaining…
 and is a control training fordischarge and usage of fixed amount
 of Chakra for Jutsu and alike.
 Hmm, I really don’t get it!
 Well, it would be better toshow you in your case.
 First, you build up Chakrain your feet.
 Then, while constantly discharginga fixed amount…
 you balance it with your body weight.
 And…
 well, this is how it goes.
 Oh! Okay! 					I’m going to try!
 First, you build up Chakrain your feet.
 Then!
 Discharge a fixed amount. Right?
 Oh!
 I knew it.
 Hot-hot-hot-hot!
 I forgot to mention it,but this hot water is 60° C.
 If you do nothing but fail…
 you will become a boiled octopus!
 Dang it!
 I’ll do it no matter what!
 You’re unusually spirited today,honored grandson!
 My principle of guidancehas finally gotten through!
 This would ordinarily be thetime to go carry out
 a surprise attack on Lord Hokage.
 I’ve stopped doing that now!
 That’s right!
 So you have finally understood.
 That the shortcut to becomingthe Hokage is to do as I say…
 There are no shortcuts!
 Huh?
 Brother Naruto said it…
 If you’re to become Hokage,be prepared for that!
 Oh!
 I’m starting to get it!
 To think he would get thehang of the Chakra control this quickly…
 I never thought,you would grow this much.
 Indeed, there are no shortcuts,in anything…
 It appears I had thewrong idea about you…
 You are a much smarter teacherthan I am.
 And, you were not just a Demon Fox…
 You were a splendidHidden Leaf Village Ninja!
 Oh! Hot!
 Hm?! That is…!
 Humph! I don’t know who you areor where you’re from, but…
 I will not allow indecency!
 Man…
 T-That is!
 What?!
 Don’t make a ruckus.
 Jeez, it won’t do to be found out!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor forthe first test of the Chunin Exam.
 You, from Hidden Sound Village!
 No doing as you pleasebefore the Exam!
 You want to be failedat the get go?!
 Sorry. It's our first time taking the Exams,so we flipped out... despite ourselves.
 Hmph. This is a good opportunity, so I'll say this.
 There will be no battles,competitions and the like
 without the permissionof the proctors!
 And even if you get permission,
 actions that could lead to the deathof an opponent will not be permitted.
 Any pig that screws with mewill be disqualified immediately.
 Got it?!
 This Exam looks to be easy!
 Now then, we will startthe first test of the Chunin Exam!
 Turn in your applications,
 take one of these number cardsin exchange,
 and sit in the seatmatching that number!
 After that, we will hand outthe paper for the written test!
 Written...? Paper...?
 Paper...
 A paper test?!
 Start Your Engines:The Chunin Exam Begins!
 Everyone's seats are all scattered...What should I do?
 He's deflated, deflated...
 It's the worst type of test for Naruto...
 Naruto...
 Oh! You are Hinata...!Since when have you...?
 L-Let's both do our best.
 Y-Yeah.
 I didn't notice her at all.
 Hinata has no presence at all...
 There are several importantrules to this first test.
 I will take no questions,so listen well accordingly!
 Rules? No questions will be taken...?
 First off is the first rule!
 You are given ten pointseach from the start!
 The written test hasten problems in all!
 Each problem is one point.
 And, this test is apoint deduction system.
 You are deducted one point foreach problem you get wrong!
 If you get three wrong,you'll have seven points!
 If I get ten wrong,I'll have zero points...
 The second rule.
 Pass or failure will be determined
 by the total points ofthe three-person teams.
 W-Wait a minute!
 What do you mean...total points of the teams?
 Shut up!
 There's a perfectlygood reason for this!
 Shut up and listen!
 Reason...?
 If you've got it,here is the most important next rule!
 Those who are deemed bythe sentinels
 as having committed an act ofcheating or something similar to that...
 will have two points deducted for each act.
 What...?
 Oh!
 In other words...
 there may be those who will bedismissed during this test
 without waiting for test grading.
 This means they're deducting points
 from things otherthan the written test problems.
 Know that those whocommit awkward cheating...
 will bring ruin upon yourselves.
 I'll check you anytime.
 If you aspire to becomea Chunin at all,
 know that Shinobi should actlike exemplary Shinobi.
 Relax...! 					Yes... yes!
 Naruto aside,Sasuke and I are okay!
 Even if Naruto gets zero points...if we cover that...
 And, in the case of even one personon the team getting zero points...
 Everyone on that team will fail!
 Wha--?!
 What did he say...?!
 I feel two menacing stares...
 Naruto?
 By the way, the last problem willbe given forty-five minutes
 after the start of the test!
 The time for the test is one hour.
 Begin!
 Could it...
 Could it be that,the fat is really on the fire now...?
 Naruto...!Just don't get zero points!
 Naruto isn't getting jittersfrom the get go, is he...?
 This is bad...
 As if!
 I know I've cleared many obstacleslike this before...
 At times like this, one shouldlook at all the problems
 without feeling pressedor making a fuss!
 And then with utmost effort
 I should tackle the problems that lookeasy to understand!
 Let's see, the first problem...is a code text, eh...
 Excellent, I say!
 Next! Next!
 Let's see... the second problem...
 The parabola B in the diagram illustratesthe greatest possible distance
 Enemy Ninja A can throw his Shurikenfrom a tree seven meters high...
 Predict and answer the Enemy Ninja'scharacter inferred
 from the ellipse this Shuriken forms,
 also answer the longest firing rangein battle on flat ground
 and explain your basis.
 T-This is an... integrated problem basedon predictions
 of uncertain conditions anddynamic energy analysis application...!
 There's no wayNaruto can solve this!
 I mean...
 hardly anyone except mecan solve this problem!
 Okay, next! 					Next!
 These other problems...are nothing but difficult ones.
 I see...
 I don't... understand evenone of these problems.
 Oh, no, this is bad!
 For real! For real!
 What should I do?What should I do? What should I do?
 If about ten of all fifty-one teamsare able to pass,
 it will be bad if I didn't stretch myself andget a considerable amount of points.
 It's like a system inviting cheating...
 I hope Sasuke and Narutowon't panic and cheat.
 It's okay...Naruto's not that much of an idiot...
 I know that...
 Don't panic...
 For now, all there is to do is to bevery, very cautious...
 and cheat without being found out!
 No! No! I can't, that's no good,no good!
 I can't tread on such thin ice!
 At any rate, this elaborate fuss...
 It's like a trick assumingthat we're going to cheat.
 They probably check with that paper...
 Somebody got nailed.
 Cheating deducts two points.
 Two-point deduction, huh...
 Ordinarily, it'd be failure the momentthe cheating was discovered...
 Know that those whocommit awkward cheating
 will bring ruin upon themselves.
 Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi.
 I see, so that's how it is, eh.
 This wasn't just an achievement test!
 The real aim was...
 a test to see the abilityfor intensive information collection
 with the full use of deceptionand concealment techniques.
 ""Shinobi should read the double bluff,"" eh...
 In other words, the true intentionof the proctor is...
 if you're going to cheat,not ""awkward cheating,""
 but ""like exemplary Shinobi"",don't get caught.
 Viewed in this light, the extraordinarinessof the point deduction system,
 the lenience of only deducting two pointsfor each discovery of cheating makes sense.
 In other words,
 what's being tested here is howwe can gather the correct answers
 without having our cheating detectedby the proctors or
 by the one being cheated on.
 Realize it quick, Naruto!
 It'll turn into a fatal mistake!
 Realize it!
 This is bad. Believe it...
 If the purpose of this test is seeingthe ability to gather information...
 then there should be someonein this classroom somewhere...
 who knows the answersto the problems!
 So Gaara has also started, eh...
 Hmph... I'm counting on you, Crow.
 Yahoo, good boy, Akamaru!Next is problem four!
 Judging from this rhythm...
 The stroke order...and the number of strokes...
 I see.
 Okay! Please tell me.
 Eight, huh.
 Lee, if you can see it,wear your headband!
 Time is rapidly going by!
 Oh, man! I'm afraid all thereis to do is cheat...
 But, if I'm discovered,
 it'll be trouble for Sakuraand Sasuke.
 On the other hand,if I get zero points...
 Sakura and Sasuke will bemy companions in failure.
 Naruto...
 I'll show you... my test.
 Huh...?
 What is Hinata saying...?
 W-Why would she dosuch a thing for me?
 Could it be... some kind of trickery?
 But Hinata is not one to dosomething like that...
 No... But she might've been coaxed intoattempting to trap me by Kiba and others...
 Hinata, let me ask you one thing!
 Huh?!
 Why would you show me?
 Uh... uh... actually...
 I...I...
 I don't want you, Naruto...to leave at this stage...
 Y-You see...the nine of us are the only rookies...
 and I have many anxieties aboutwhat's to come, so!
 I get it now! I was kind ofstrangely suspicious of you!
 Anyhow! This is crazy lucky, I say!
 Thank goodness I'm next to Hinata...
 W-What was that?I was about to turn...
 W-What was that for, sir?!
 You made five mistakes. You fail!
 N-No way...

 We don't overlook you blinking once...
 In a matter of speaking,this strength is the proof.
 Naruto...?
 Hurry... Look...
 Hinata... You don't get it, do you?
 What...?
 An awesome ninja like mewon't cheat. Believe it!
 N-Naruto.
 B-But...
 Also, if something went wrong,
 you'd be in a hot spot forhelping me cheat, right?!

 Even if I take it, I'm a Genin for lifeonce I get it wrong?!
 Really? Really? Really?
 If I don't take it, I'll fail withmy comrades immediately?
 No way, no way, no way.

 Not good, not good, not good.
 No way can I choose which one!

220,"So this is the Shukaku?
 It’s the first time I’ve seenthe real thing…
 It’s dangerous here!We have to get away!
 But! Gaara Sensei…
 Shut up.
 Gaara is trying…to protect you!
 So hurry!
 R-Right.
 Hey! Could that be…?!
 Yeah…
 The Shukaku transformationis starting.
 Gaara…
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Hinata, Sakura.
 Matsuri, you okay?
 Y-Yes. But Gaara Sensei…
 I leave her to you…
 Hold it! You are badly hurt!
 But…
 You’ll just become unableto move right away!
 I’ll give you some first-aid treatment!
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 The distance created between usbecame too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouthmakes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile,even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Departure
 This is bad… It’s a matter of time.
 I knew it.
 Sakura! Hurry!lt looks like we don’t have much time!
 Got it! First, put your hands out.
 R-Right…
 What’s the meaning of this?
 What is it, Neji?
 That guy wearing the armor isreleasing Chakra stronger than Gaara…
 who’s half transformed into a beast.
 That person called himself Seimei,the creator of the Village of Artisans.
 He said something about being rebornas the ultimate Ninja tool.
 That jerk!He’s taken away Gaara’s Chakra!
 Come to think of it, the enemywe fought wore similar armor…
 and took away a great dealof my Chakra.
 Armor that sucks up Chakra…
 And that alarming form…
 It doesn’t look likewe can just carelessly get close.
 Now… What do we do?
 I didn’t figure on fightingagainst the Shukaku…
 However, this is fun, too.
 As great as the Shukaku may be,this way, I can prove that
 it’s no match for the ultimate Ninja toolof the Village of Artisans.
 Why is this guy so strong?
 I won’t allow my important people…
 to get hurt!
 If not, I will stop you,
 even if that means thatI have to kill you!
 Why…?
 How is it that you can fightso much for other people…?
 They saved me fromthe hell of being all alone.
 They accepted me forwho I was…
 that’s why…they are important to me!
 Love is a heart that desires to servea precious person who is close to oneself,
 and to love and watch over that person…
 Love…
 That is why he is so strong?
 Gaara!
 What’s that?Gaara Sensei is returning to normal?
 What happened to him?!
 Gaara might be suppressingShukaku of his own volition.
 Why? Wouldn’t he end up weakeninghis own battle strength?
 Even so, he chose to fightwith his own strength and will,
 not Shukaku's power,which he can’t control.
 So you couldn’t maintainthe Shukaku body with that Chakra?
 I’ll…help the friends importantto me with my own power…
 How absurd.
 A Shinobi doesn’t need emotion.
 It is those who suppress their emotionswho can obtain great power.
 Great power.That power is the only justice.
 You’re finished now.
 Eat this!
 That’s as far as you go,monster of the Sand Village.
 Acting tough, huh…?
 You shouldn’t haveany Chakra left to fight with.
 Indeed,  I only have a little bitof Chakra left…
 But do you think I just sat aroundin the cage doing nothing at all?
 What?!
 Sand Tsunami!
 You shouldn’t haveany sand you can control!
 I’m Gaara of the desert!
 It’s simple for me to crush rocksand turn them into sand.
 Kujaku: Hurricane Formation!
 So you still hadthat much power left, huh?
 Then I’ll just suck up all of that power!
 Gaara’s Chakra is being sucked out!
 – Wha--?! 					– Gaara Sensei!
 – Damn it! 					– Wait! Naruto!
 What, Shikamaru? Don’t stop me!
 You’ll just get in the way if you go!
 Besides, our Gaara is strong!
 Gaara…
 Extreme Tempered Ultimate Attack:
 Shukaku's Pike!
 Wh-Why…? Why could you…?
 Someone who gave up on being humanand was reborn as a Ninja tool
 could never understand anyway.
 I don’t understand. Why?
 Why?!
 Giant Sand Burial!
 He did it!
 Gaara Sensei won!
 Yeah! Gaara!
 – Gaara! 					– Gaara!
 He’s okay…
 He’s just extremely fatigued
 on account of usinghis Chakra all at once.
 Gaara completely suppressedthe Shukaku on his own volition.
 Yeah…
 I want to work hard
 and become an existence acknowledgedby other people…
 I thought that lookingat Naruto Uzumaki.
 Ties with other people…
 For me, until now, that was just hateand murderous intent.
 However, there’s somethingI’ve understood just a little…
 about the ties he goes so far forand talks about.
 Suffering, sorrow and happinesscan be shared with someone.
 You’ve also made someoneyou can share with at last…
 Did you say something?
 No, nothing…
 We came to the troubleof rushing here.
 To think it’d be over…
 It seemsthe inexperienced knuckleheads
 have grown a teeny weeny bit…
 You are very strict.
 Pervy Sage!
 Oh, long time no see, Naruto.
 Don’t give me that “long time no see”garbage, you jerk Sage!
 You were talking all big aboutwatching my training,
 making me into your protégéand stuff!
 Where were you traipsingaround until now?!
 Well, how can I put this?I was gathering information.
 It was probably just informationon naked ladies anyway, right?
 You idiot!
 Even I come through when it counts…
 I was mainly after informationon the Akatsuki.
 Akatsuki!
 With this I’ve been ableto verify their actions.
 And now as promised,
 two years later whenthey’ll move into high gear,
 I will thoroughly train you.
 I wonder if you’re prepared?
 I’ve been tired of waiting!
 I owe you one.
 No. I just repaid the debtfrom last time.
 Next time, I’ll settle thingsmore properly.
 Well, this time I’ll acknowledgethat you didn’t cry.
 Not again.
 Just like a woman…
 What about him?
 Huh?
 Naruto?
 I hear he’s leaving today ona training journey with Jiraiya.
 Jiraiya? One of the Genius Sannin?
 Yeah. 					lt’s such a pain.
 He’s going to come backhaving gotten stronger again.
 See you around.
 – Farewell… 					– See ya.
 Please tell Naruto…
 Thanks to him,
 I figured out what the wordsGaara Sensei spoke of meant.
 I’ll dedicate myself underGaara Sensei from now on…
 What did he do?
 Well, I guess that’s about it.
 I read the Village of Artisans reportfrom the other day.
 Although it didn’t go as far asa perfect 100,
 I’ll give you a passing grade.
 No! I’m still very much lackingin experience.
 Of course!
 I’ll have you carry outseveral missions
 and get you to build uplots of experience,
 so make sure to dedicate yourself!
 What?! Does that meanI’m totally going to get overworked?
 Umm, Sakura. Got a minute?
 Ino?
 Sure. What’s up?
 As, as it happens,I was thinking about it the while…
 But it became totally clear to meon this mission!
 Clear that I’d be no good at allat this rate!
 Ino.
 It’s frustrating,but I was envious of you.
 You, who everyone depended on.
 So, please.I also want to become a Medical Ninja.
 I know it’ll be hard.
 But I’ve got guts and I’ll managethe studying, no matter what.
 So could you ask Lady Tsunade for me?
 – Sure. 					– Really?!
 But prepare yourself.
 Once that happens,you’ll be my little sister protégé.
 What’s that…?
 Naturally!
 After all, I’ll be yourMedical Ninja superior, you know.
 Man, I can’t wait.
 You’ll be my lovable little sister protégé.
 I’ll train you nice and hard.
 Just you watch!I’ll pass you up right away!
 Ha! Try it if you can! You Ino pig!
 I’ll do it! Billboard Brow!
 Why?! Why is it?!
 What are you talking about?!
 Why was I the only one left outof the mission the other day?!
 But you were witha different team then, right?
 But everyone had taken part!
 She’s kind of in a rage.
 It’s hard being the only one left outof a mission.
 Come to think of it,
 it seems Naruto finally leavesfor training.
 I heard. It seems that Jiraiyais going to be his mentor.
 Damn it! That guy’s goingto get strong again.
 It looks like the village willget quiet for a while.
 Viewed in that light,it’s a little bit sad, isn’t it?
 No! This isn’t the timeto be getting sad!
 I must work hard!
 Several times more,several times more.
 If I don’t work hard hundredsof times more than Naruto,
 I won’t be able to face himthe next time we meet.
 Your guard is off!
 We also must grow by that time.
 It’s because trying to improveby learning from others,
 that is what’s called friendship.
 Good grief,we’d better not lose, Akamaru.
 Same here!
 Hey, you okay, Lee?!
 I’m fine, I’m fine.
 Lady Hinata, let’s call it a day.
 What? I’m still…
 It’s about time for his departure.
 Oh!
 You won’t be able tosee him for a while.
 I see… It looks like you’ll beon a long journey…
 Yeah!
 Listen up.Be sure to train and don’t goof off.
 Right! You can count on me!
 It’s about time to go, Naruto.
 Right!
 Okay! I’m off, Iruka Sensei!
 I’ll pay you back for the ramenonce I’ve become a success.
 Jeez…
 Good luck, Naruto.
 Keep your eyes on me.
 What’re you doing?!I’ll leave you behind, Naruto.
 Hey. H-Hey, wait up!
 I also have to work hard in orderto catch up with Naruto.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 It’s been two years since his departure.
 Now the count down tothe battle begins.
 Those who pursue and thosewho are pursued.
 Time will not wait for the boy.
 As Akatsuki Organization beginsto take action,
 the day of Orochimaru’s reincarnationdraws near.
 In order to take back what he lost,
 the boy once again throws himselfinto the maelstrom of cruel fate…

 Their feelings towards the clanare the same as our feelings!
 Manipulating the Fuma’s feelings ofwanting to restore their clan…
 I’ll kick Orochimaru’s butt,no matter what!
 Pure Terror                         The House of Orochimaru
 How did the Pervy Sage,
 who was once so easily defeated byOld Lady Tsunade’s numbing medicine
 detect Sasame’s medicine this time?
 Isn’t it strange thatMaster Jiraiya’s that sharp?
 Hey, hey…
 Remember when Sasame talkedabout Hanzaki and said he’s a traitor?
 That’s how I knew…
 Hanzaki told me everything…
 When Orochimaru came to this land,there were those among us
 who wanted to use his strengthto revive the clan
 and those that saw his evil intentand said we should not join him.
 Hmm… so that’s why you guyswere chased out of your village.
 Yes. It was probably Orochimaru’s ideawe were chased out of our village
 as traitors who were gettingin the way of a revival of the clan.
 When Sasame called Hanzaki a traitor,
 I knew that Sasame had ties to a groupthat was on Orochimaru’s side.
 Fool!
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 Just wait a minute!
 I’m prepared!
 Sasame, you did it so thatyou could meet Arashi… Isn't that so?
 I’m sorry…that was the only thing I could do.
 Master Jiraiya!
 Sasame did it only becauseshe wanted to see her cousin.
 Please forgive her!
 I’m asking you to forgive her too!
 The law of the Shinobiis a strict thing…
 I can’t just acquit her like this.
 Then punish me first!
 I promised I’d help Sasamesee her cousin Arashi!
 If I don’t fulfill that I’ll have twistedmy Way of Ninja!
 Master Jiraiya, me too!
 Now now, wait a minute!lt’s not as if I’m gonna eat her alive.
 – Huh?! 					– Oh?
 Sasame, Hanzaki was worried that
 you might leave your village tolook for Arashi…
 After you escort us toOrochimaru’s hideout,
 you’ll immediately head tothe inn where Hanzaki is
 and wait there for our return.
 That is the punishment given to you.
 Master Jiraiya…
 Pervy Sage,I’ve gotta give you more credit!
 Thank you, Master Jiraiya!
 Well, Hanzaki treated me toa lot of special service at the Fuma Bar
 and asked me to look after Sasame…
 I thought it was somethinglike that anyway!
 I feel cheated thatI gave you more credit!
 He, hey…lt’s all right once in a while, right?
 There’s something calledsocializing for adults…
 There it is….
 Leave the rest to us.
 Sasame, be careful going backto the inn.
 Don’t worry! I will absolutelybring Arashi back!
 Please take care of Arashi!
 Leave it to me!
 Just wait, and rest assured thatI’ll do everything I can!
 Stop getting so carried away Naruto,you idiot!
 Oww!
 That’s where…
 Sasuke is…!
 So this is the only entrance…
 If they’re lying in wait,we’ll be picked off.
 But there’s nothing we can do but go!
 Well, don’t panic.
 If three large rats go, we’ll stand out.
 First, let’s send out onethat won’t stand out.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Hey!
 Th-The frog spoke!
 Hey, it’s been a while!Sakura, this is Gamakichi.
 Gamakichi?!
 I wanted to ask you to dosome reconnaissance.
 All right! That’s a simple task.Leave it to me!
 I can’t help it,frogs give me the creeps …
 There doesn’t seemto be anything fishy…
 There doesn’t seem to bea trap at the entrance.
 Arashi…
 There’s nothing to it around here.
 Hmm…
 What shall we do?
 It seems there’s no choicebut to split up into three.
 My instinct tells meit’s the middle one!
 Wait!
 What the heck?!
 At times like this, it’s especiallyimportant to move carefully…
 All right, I’ll go this way!
 That’s it?!
 So what’s so different frommy instinct and that, Pervy Sage?
 Well, it’s a question of feeling…
 If you haven’t found anythingafter 30 minutes, come back.
 Got it?
 Yeah…
 Naruto, Sakura, the two of youshould proceed together.
 Listen, from this point forward,it’s the first avenue of hell.
 A demon might appear,or a snake might appear.
 Take them on mindfully!
 Yup!
 I understand!
 We’re going down the middle!
 Then I’m going this way…
 See ya …
 Hmm…the smell of face powder.
 I’m being invited in…
 In that case, it might be good funto accept the invitation.
 What…?
 Because guests would bearriving from far away,
 I was directed by Lord Orochimaruto entertain.
 I’m guessingit's a type of fox raccoon ghost…
 If you’re sayingI’m some raccoon or fox,
 you ought to come over hereand check to see if I have a tail or not.
 Oh, this path was right on…
 How about yours, Naruto?
 Sakura, be careful!
 There’s no telling what sortof traps there might be…
 Yeah…
 – Oh?! 					– Naruto?!
 And you were the one whosaid to be careful!
 It was an ingenious trap floor!
 Oh!
 What the hell is next!
 Sakura!
 Naruto!
 It’s my fault…
 Naruto!
 What the hell…
 I can’t get out…
 What’re you doing?!
 You screamed in sucha misleading way, I totally thought…
 Give me a hand!
 You’re really a handful!
 Ya saved me…
 Really! I’ll go first!
 Naruto…
 It’s all right now.
 Here!
 Huh?!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Sakura…
 Naruto?! Are you all right?
 Don’t worry about me.
 You need to hurry andget out of this trap hallway!
 But…
 I said go! I’ll follow behind for sure!
 Really?
 Yeah… I’ll catch up in no time!
 You’d better come, no matter what.
 It’s a promise, you know…
 The sake doesn’t seemtampered with.
 So what kind of plot has been prepared…?
 Just as I’d expect fromthe Village Hidden in Sound…
 Are you planning to put a Jutsuon me using music?
 The music isn’t only for guests.lt’s for myself…
 I see…
 What do you play for your heart?
 Music for my own funeral…
 Trying to seduce me….You’ve underestimated this Jiraiya!
 Escorting the guest tothe underworld is my last mission.
 A suspended ceiling?!
 I need to hurry upand get out of this place!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 This is torture!
 What the hell?!
 Give me a hand!
 We need to build up our Chakraand create the Rasengan!
 Don’t be absurd!
 We can’t stretchour bodies beyond this!
 My muscles are cramping up!
 Man! I’ve gotta do something…
 – What! 					– Huh?!
 What?!
 – Water?! 					– Water!
 Looks like I’ve been saved.
 Hey, get outta my way!
 Oh, it’s you, Naruto.
 Gamakichi, is therea way out somewhere?
 Don’t know!I was flushed down here too.
 So it’s no good…
 Hey, are you all right?
 How could I be all right!
 Naruto’s taking a long time.
 Maybe I should go back…
 It's admirable thatyou made it this far, Sakura.
 Is that Kabuto’s voice?!
 Isn’t it ironic?
 During the Chunin Examin the Village Hidden in the Leaves,
 you were the only onethat dragged the team down,
 but yet you’re the oneto make it this far.
 I’m not by myself!
 Naruto and Master Jiraiyawill be here right away!
 Where’s Sasuke?He is all right, isn’t he?
 Shouldn’t you be worried aboutNaruto and Master Jiraiya,
 and not Sasuke?
 Well, it may very well be that those twoare no longer in this world anymore.
 No way…
 There’s no way Master Jiraiya and Narutowould be taken down that easily!
 I wonder if that’s so?
 Maybe you dragged Narutodown like you always do?
 So I’m right …
 Naruto…
 If you’re worriedyou should go and see…
 Or perhaps you’re afraidof me attacking
 and you can’t come outfrom behind the pillar.
 If someone like you wereon my team,
 I don’t know how many livesI would need.
 I can too…
 I can too!
 Substitution Jutsu?!
 Substitution again?!
 I can too…When I fight, I fight!
 As I thought, this is all you’ve got…
 It’s about time I put an end to this.
 I can’t keep Lord Orochimaru waitingfor no reason any longer, you see.
 Orochimaru?!
 Now…shall we see…
 just who will be stealingscrolls from whom?
 We’ll fight to the death!
 No! I’m different from how I was…then!
 I wonder if that’s true…
 It can’t be…
 Even if you put up a bluff,I can foresee …
 You are already…finished.
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as thoughI had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two handsA droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memoriesLost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 I’m scared.What is this intimidating feeling?
 My legs are weak andI don’t have any strength in my body.
 I thought I’m not the same personas I was in the past.
 I must stop. Calm down.
 These guys are here,which means Sasuke is definitely here!
 I need to fight!I came here to save Sasuke!

 You’re an insect handlerand you don’t know that?
 He’s right!C’mon, are you really an insect handler?
 What about the Bikochu?
 Nothing.
 We did an all-out mobilizationand searched,
 but we haven’t found it.
 Aren’t these guys carrying it?
 That’s unthinkable.
 So that means…
 So we’re going to have toask one of these guys, after all.
 Who’s gonna talk?!
 We can tell you.
 Shino!
 However…lt’s in exchange for Hinata.
 That’s stupid, isn’t it? To bargain…
 Do you not understand your position?
 You guys definitely will notfind the Bikochu.
 And you’re pressed for time.
 You are the ones…who will regret it.
 What should we do?
 If things stay like this,
 the Bikochu won’t be of any helpeven if it hatches.
 In that case, our mission is also…
 But…
 If we can get rid of even oneof the Aburame family…
 Hinata…
 Are you worried?
 Of course!
 She’s strong.
 Huh?
 Much more…than you think.
 I concede. We have a deal.
 First of all, we need our friend.
 What happened?
 The brat…isn’t here.
 The wax she was trapped in isn’t there.…
 She may have been swept outto the waterfall.
 Jibachi!
 It can’t be helped! I warned her notto make a bad move or she’d die.
 You!
 What did you do to Hinata?!
 What happened to Hinata! Hey!
 Shut up, kid.
 The kid’s probably inthe depths of hell about now.
 Damn you!
 Aha, the girl’s your girlfriend?
 You…! I absolutely will not forgive you!
 You’re kidding me.What can you do looking like that?
 Without Hinata you’ll never getyour hands on the Bikochu either.
 You are right…
 That girl’s death was not partof the plan,
 but in the end, it’s a good thing.
 Because…we’ll take your lives in return.
 From the very beginning, people fromthe Village Hidden in the Leaves and
 from my own Village Hidden in the Stoneshave been sworn enemies.
 It’s natural that we killeach other, isn’t it?
 What're ya gonna do, little guy?
 Die like this?
 Or if you tell me where the Bikochu is,I could save you for now.
 – All right.– Don’t you dare tell them!
 Those jerks,I’m going to blow them away!
 Shut up, brat!
 – Jibachi? 					– Hey!
 Shut up, I’ve got to kill him!
 It’s a Paper Bomb!
 You’re…!
 Y-You’re…!
 …still alive!
 That was really close.But I didn’t give up, just like Naruto…
 Did she escape from the wax?lt can’t be!
 These are not ordinary kids.
 Leave it to me!
 Hinata!
 I’ve never used that in an actual fight…
 But I have to do it here, now!
 Bee Bombs Jutsu!
 1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!
 Bee Swarm Jutsu!
 Naruto…
 Naruto… Watch me.
 Protective 8 Trigrams 64 palms!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 You’re kidding, right?
 That Hinata can dosuch an amazing Jutsu?
 The Hinata that you know, Naruto,is from when?
 What do you mean?
 You’ve learned new Jutsusince the Chunin Ninja Exam, haven’t you?
 Hinata has been steadily developing, too.
 She always has been concerned…
 Take aim.
 That’s nice, the three of you,
 all have something you’re good atand something you like.
 Hinata, you should find something, too…
 You’re right.
 By the way, what is it?
 You had some business with me,didn’t you?
 Yeah…
 I want you to join mein my training.
 Hinata was fretting overwhat she could do…
 What she should do…
 Hinata!
 Hey, I don’t think that we should…
 No… Don’t go easy on me!
 If you’re doing it for me…
 Do it seriously!
 I’ve got it!
 During the harsh training,
 Hinata discovered her own styles…and her own special Jutsu.
 That’s the result of her training.
 Huh? You, why!?
 I’ll tell you something…
 Angering the Queen Bee,getting encased in wax,
 it was all part of the strategy.
 With our Chakra being suckedand being immobilized,
 it was the only way to protect ourselvesfrom the larvae…
 And, do you think I was doing nothingwhile I was captured?
 I was ordering my bugs.The wax we’re wrapped in is very weak.
 Shino!
 Because of her hard training,
 Hinata’s Chakra controlhas dramatically improved.
 That Jutsu is what she developedfrom the training…
 Protective 8 trigrams 64 palms!
 Hinata’s already flexible body combinedwith fine-tuned Chakra control
 could completely defendan attack from every direction…
 Truly, it’s an ultimate defense Jutsu.
 Yet it’s different fromNeji’s 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation.
 It’s Hinata’s own Jutsu…
 She finally worked that out on her own.
 She probably did it because she wantedto be acknowledged by her father.
 To be acknowledged by everyone…
 And to be acknowledged by you.
 Our Jutsu isn’t effective at all?!
 What the hell is going on?
 What a girl!
 Hey, what happened to those guys?!
 When did they?!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Blow them away!
 Hinata!
 Shino!
 Believe…in her.
 Make the Chakra…
 sharper, stronger…
 bigger, more flexible…
 more…more…more…more…more…more…more!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Naruto…
 Hinata, that’s an awesome Jutsu!You’re really awesome!
 Naruto…!
 Let’s hurry. It’ll be dawn soon.
 – Okay! 					– Yeah!
 Oh, it’s becoming a pupa already?
 If we make it smell Sasuke’s scentat the moment it hatches,
 the mission is complete.
 Right!
 Sasuke… Wait for me!
 No way!
 Inside the tree, huh.
 If it was there,the bees should have found it…
 You can still move?
 This insect cage was coatedwith secret Aburame family insect repellent.
 Wh-What?
 The bees won’t come closebecause of the repellent.
 As long as you’re using bees to search…you definitely won’t find it.
 I expected as much.
 I think as long as your clan exists…
 my clan maybe destined tobe ruined some day.
 But!
 I absolutely will not let yousucceed at your mission!
 Even if it kills me, that Bikochu…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 This is our hope…in order to get our friend back!
 I won’t let you do that!
 Shut up!
 Rasengan!
 Hey, look…
 The pupa is hatching!
 Okay!
 Huh? It's gone!
 You had it ‘til just a minute ago!
 Hey, search for it, hurry!
 R-Right…
 Byakugan!
 Naruto! Over there.
 You blew it away the instant you set offthe Rasengan!
 Hurry!
 I know!
 C’mon, c’mon.
 It’s going to hatch!
 We did it! Hurry, make it sniff this…
 Wh-Why…?!
 That thing just now doesn’t count!C’mon, sniff Sasuke’s smell!
 It’s all over now.
 Huh…?
 Hey! Stop! Wait!
 So you failed because you farted!
 Take responsibility!
 What are you saying that for?!
 Well then…
 That’s…the Bikochu, isn’t it?
 Naruto… I found you!
 C’mon, forgive me already, Sakura!
 No! I absolutely will not forgive you!
 – Sakura, you look so scary!– Come back here!
 So the mission failed…
 It seems that they succeededat protecting the Bikochu,
 but failed at getting it to smellthe scent of Sasuke Uchiha.
 I see… Hinata must be depressed.
 This strategy was her idea, wasn’t it?
 Well… Looks like that’s not the case.
 Hinata… I heard that your mission failed.
 Yes. It didn’t work at all.
 I have to train more and more…and work harder next time!
 I-I see… Good luck.
 More…
 More…
 More…
 More!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring outthrough the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused erawith my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused nightwith my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitarand my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards,I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What! Why do I have to go onsuch an easy mission?!
 Don’t complain! You’re the onewho picked up this mission’s client!
 That’s no reason!After all, I’m busy with a lot stuff!
 That’s enough,or I’ll send you back to the Academy!
 That’s not fair…
 No arguments!Neji, Tenten, Lee, Naruto!
 The four of you,I’m delivering your new mission.

 Yahoo!
 Roar and Howl!The Ultimate Tag-Team!
 Got you!
 Damn!
 What’s going on?!
 I felt a response to my attack,but it didn’t work.
 And where did his attackcome from?
 Listen, Akamaru.
 We’re gonna attack from both sideswith Fang Over Fang.
 Here we go!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 This doesn’t look so good.
 I’ll play a melody of death for you.
 What’s with this guy?
 What?!
 Two on two is perfect,right, Sakon?
 How could the Sound Ninja Fourtake so much time?
 Did they send such strong peopleafter them who could hold them up…
 or are they playing around too much?
 Well, the one that’s probablydelaying things is…
 either Jirobo who gets hungry a lot,or Kidomaru who likes to play.
 But the one that’sthe most dangerous
 when he loses his temperis Sakon.
 He’s not satisfied untilhe kills his opponent,
 even though he shouldjust leave things be.
 He thinks he’s the strongest ofthe four, so he shows off.
 I wonder if that’s so…
 Tayuya has a personality that’sneck and neck with Sakon.
 But in any case,nothing bad will happen
 since we sent that kid…
 Kimimaro.
 He’ll surely clean up anything that isnot good for me.
 I will never let you take Sasuke!
 There’s a lot of trash scattered about.
 But after all, trash is trash.
 It simply needs to be cleaned up.
 Shut up!
 Come on.
 I’ll crush you!
 So this is the so-calledmelody of death.
 So she’s manipulating themwith the sound of the flute.
 Damn! She’s gettingfurther and further away.
 What should I do?!What is it that I should do?!
 Huh?!
 This is really looking bad!
 Akamaru!
 Oh, so you’re the real one!
 Multiple Fists Barrage!
 One more!
 My brother and I get along very well.
 Usually, my older brother Ukonsleeps inside of me,
 but when there’s a fighthe comes out and helps out.
 This is this guy’s ability.
 Ukon can stick outhis arms and legs, his head,
 from anywhere in my bodyand attacks or defends.
 Like this you see…
 Multiple Legs Barrage!
 It’s a three-legged kick.Works well, doesn’t it?
 So next, it’s…!
 There’s no time to waste, Sakon.
 We’ll finish this quickly!Get into the second state!
 All right, all right…
 You’re too impatient, bro.
 I see, you’re saying those hornsaren’t just for display, huh?
 As soon as that right one came out,
 his Chakra increasedby several tenfold.
 Shoot!
 It seemed hopeless before,but now it’s really bad.
 What’s your liking, bro?
 In pieces.
 So now,perhaps it’s time to get serious.
 I’ll take care of you all at once.
 Such confident words!But those are my lines!
 Shoot! These guys are persistent!
 But it’s starting toget clearer to me.
 But the problem isfrom here on out.
 Damn! Am I completely out of hands?
 What?! You’re sayingwe’re gonna do that?!
 No, Akamaru!
 It’s too dangerous to do it herewithout our comrades!
 You understand, don't you?
 If we use that Jutsu,
 both you and I will use upmost of our Chakra
 and won’t be able to move.
 If we miss, we’ll die here in vain.
 Akamaru…
 What a pitiful master I am…that you had to bite me.
 I understand, Akamaru.
 Just like you said,we only have that left!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Now, Akamaru!
 What?!
 Do it well…Akamaru!
 Show them the results of the training!
 It’s Dynamic Marking!
 Playing dirty like that!
 All preparations are done!
 Inuzuka-Style!Man-Beast Transformation Combo!
 Two-Headed Wolf!
 I wondered what it was goingto be and
 it turned out to bea drooling runt of a dog.
 What can a dog like this do?
 Take this!
 Drool?!
 Sakon, what’re you doing!To the right!
 Damn!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Heh! How’s that!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang revolution speedis too fast.
 It’s such an intense high revolution thateven our visibility becomes zero.
 Even without direct contact,flesh is cut…
 A direct hit from the blowand you’re in pieces.
 Really…getting carried away…
 This is perfect.We were just thinking of separating soon.
 What?! He divided into two people?!
 It’s true…
 Had we fully received the blow as one,it would’ve been bad, but…
 The real battle begins now.
 Damn it…
 Yeah… I know Akamaru.
 One more shot ofWolf Fang Over Fang.
 The next one is our limit.
 We’ll take them down with this!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 It’s no use hiding!
 I told you we don’t chasewith our eyes!
 We attack by chasing smellswe’ve marked with our noses!
 – A! 					– Un!
 – Summoning… 					– Summoning…
 – Rashomon! 					– Rashomon!
 That’s an impressive power…
 To turn Rashomon,
 the ultimate shield to protectLord Orochimaru into this shape.
 But…
 – This is the end!– This is the end!
 Akamaru!
 Akamaru…To protect me, you…
 Damn! He did it again!
 My eyes…!
 Damn!
 Damn…!This time it’s not ordinary piss!
 It feels like my eyes are burningwith strong acid!
 Where’s the other one?!
 Hey…
 Who are you looking for?
 I’ll take care of the rest.Go wash your eyes in that river.
 This is my ability…specialized in assassination, of course.
 You can’t beat me byjust having a good nose and nails.
 You can’t beat my ability!
 You know that the Chakra Networkthrough which Chakra flows
 is deeply interwoven with eachinternal organ, right?
 The Chakra Network is interwovenin a variety of complicated ways
 and is linked to the tissues thatmake up each organ.
 Also to each cell that makes upthe tissues,
 as well as even to proteins,which are the main component of cells…
 At the second state,
 I can dismantle or reconstruct these cellsor proteins as I wish by using Chakra.
 To put it simply,
 I can turn my body into tiny pieces,enter my opponent’s body…
 return to my original formand come back out.
 Akamaru…
 I’m sorry… Akamaru…!
 We’ve always done things together…
 we were together,always and everywhere.
 Yahoo! Good boy, Akamaru!
 Yahoo! We’re lucky that the peoplewho got into our trap had Earth Scroll!
 With our luck like this,we’ll reach the goal first.
 Akamaru is frightenedall of a sudden.
 He can smell the strength ofan oppoenent’s Chakra.
 I’ve never seen him this scared…
 The people fighting over there mustbe something..
 The Seventh Round Battle.Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka.
 Hey! First of all, don’t you bringa puppy in here!
 He’ll get in the way of our battle!
 Idiot! Akamaru is fighting along with me!
 Now then…
 Let’s go, Akamaru!
 Eat this!
 There!
 Naruto… I'm taking Akamaru back.
 Wh-What?! What did you feed him?His coating has changed to red!
 That’s why his name is Akamaru.
 Let’s go, Akamaru!
 Beast Mimicry Ninja Art:
 Man- Beast Clone!
 Let’s go! All-Four….
 Jutsu!
 An opening!
 Take this!Man-Beast Ultimate Taijutsu!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Akamaru!
 Here, Food Pills.
 Akamaru! Human Mimicry Ninja Art!
 Fang Over Fang!
 However, this one time,I’m sunk…
 My cells can swim insideyour body as I wish,
 and I can even create partsthat are only you.
 In other words,a little bit of a fusion condition.
 A sharing of the flesh is what it’ll be.
 A sharing?
 That’s right…and a cruel wayof killing that only I can accomplish…
 The gradual scraping awayof just your cells.
 I see.
 If that’s the case…!
 If I do this, what’s gonna happen?
 Suicide?! That’s ridiculous!
 Die with me…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words

 Everybody, you did well…

 Earth Style Barrier:Earth Dome Prison!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Human Boulder!
 Damn!
 Such useless acts…
 There’s no time.
 We’re going to split into two here!
 Why?!
 I see…
 Even at 5 against 1,with our Chakras taken away,
 he’s not someone we caneasily defeat…
 If we take our time,Sasuke will pass the borders.
 If that happens, we won’t be ableto handle this on our own.
 So we split up…one team to stop him
 and one to go after Sasuke, right?
 Yeah. The sub leader is goingto be you, Neji.
 I found them!
 Neji! Take Kiba and Choji,and go after Sasuke!
 Got it!
 This guy…
 Naruto and I will handle!
 Are you going to putthe Shadow Paralysis Jutsu on me again?
 Such a foolish Jutsu.
 I don’t need to see that kind ofstreet performance more than once!
 And who was it that got trickedby that street performance earlier?
 He disappeared?!
 Behind us!
 Earth Style: Sphere of Graves!
 He’s nuts!
 Be careful!There’s another one coming!
 You are the platoon leader,if I’m not mistaken.
 You sure do sufferwhen you have a stupid leader.
 You underlings!
 A stupid leader like this…
 I’ll get rid of for you!
 Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder!
 Thanks! Choji…
 Why? Wasting my good intentions…
 If the leader is stupid,then I guess the subordinates are losers.
 Well… I’ll kill you losersbefore you suffer
 working undera glum shadow lover like him!
 Darn, darn! Babbling on like that!
 I will…!
 He’s mine!
 I will…take care of him!
 Choji…
 What are you saying?!
 He’s not the kind of guyyou can handle on your own!
 I will do it!
 Choji… you…
 Shikamaru…Take these Food Pills for everyone…
 Choji… You are not…
 That’s right.I have that secret weapon of mine.
 But Choji, that is…!
 Huh… Losers, I won’t let youhave your way!
 He’s coming!
 I’ll get rid of you all here!
 Go, everyone!
 Pills of three colors?They’re not Food Pills.
 What are they?
 First…Spinach Pill!
 Get out of the way! Loser!
 Impossible… He stopped me?!
 Shikamaru, take everybody and go!
 Choji…
 What did we gather for?
 If we lose Sasuke,then we will end up like he said…
 The stupid leader and his losers!
 You better catch up with us, Choji!
 Yeah.
 Everybody, go!
 All right! Let’s go, everyone!
 – Yeah! 					– Right!
 Choji…
 I’m going to get rid of you quickand get rid of those guys too!
 It won’t be that easy…
 What?!
 I will…
 …stop you!
 A parting gift from Choji…Eat it!
 Yeah!
 Thanks, Choji…
 Kiba!
 Thanks!
 Shikamaru…That pill that Choji took earlier..
 It seemed like some sortof trump card,
 but does he have a chance to win?
 He said that he has a secret weapon.
 He brought the Akimichi clan’sultimate secret pills on this mission…
 These are the Triad Colored Pillsof green, yellow, and red.
 If you take it,you can gain explosive powers.
 The energy that each pillcontains is enormous!
 I see! I see!So that’s why he was so confident!
 But…there’s always a side effectto any pills that work too well.
 Damn… I didn’t think it would hurtso much with just the Spinach Pill.
 I hope that Choji can settle itwith just the green pill.
 Don’t take the red one,no matter what, Choji.
 I’m going to finish you at once!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Spiky Human Boulder.
 He raised the rotationaland destructive power
 by using the Kunai Knives as spikes!
 Earth Style: Terra Shield.
 What?!
 I-I did it…?
 Yeah. That’s what I was thinking too.
 Akamaru… 					What is he saying?
 You know that Akamarucan tell the strength of the enemy
 just by the smell, right?
 He’s worried if Choji is going to be ableto handle that monster with just the pills.
 True…
 If we were to assessthe situation objectively,
 that giant’s ability is unknown…
 The possibility of Choji being ableto defeat him might be close to zero.
 But…
 That is how battle is…
 Don’t get carried away, loser!
 Shatter Palm!
 Did you know?
 When there’s a group of peopleof five or so,
 there’s always one loser.
 That person is always made fun of…
 and when it comes down to it,
 they’ll just toss that personaside like a pawn.
 I’m talking about you!
 Choji. All you want to do is eat.You should train some at least!
 You get teased because you’re like that.You’re just a f--
 You said somebody exceptional, right?
 Shouldn’t we ask Shino or somebody?!
 This guy is useless too…
 That is true…
 No matter how hard I try on my own…
 I…
 Seems like I hit it right on the nose.
 Seems like the Leaf is lacking in people,
 seeing that they pick a loserlike you to be on the pursuit team.
 Why don’t we finish this up already?!
 Knee Lift!
 Shoulder Charge!
 Huh! You really are a loser to the end!
 Your high spirit didn’t last long at all,only at the beginning…!
 You really are the ideal loser!
 A loser like you shouldn’t have cometo a place like this!
 You should blame your stupid leaderfor choosing you!
 Shikamaru…
 Neji’s right. It’s how a battle is.
 From the start, this missionwasn’t for recreation.
 It’s life or death.
 Hey Shikamaru…
 I already anticipated the worst scenario
 in which we would be fightingseparately on our own.
 And at this point,
 if we’re not prepared for“one person, one kill,”
 we might not be ableto catch up to Sasuke.
 Choji is a good guy,but he doesn’t have the confidence.
 He thinks thathe’s the weakest of all of us.
 He actually is weak.Anybody can see that.
 That’s why he was the first tostay behind to try to be useful.
 Just as I thought…
 But…
 Choji and I have worked as a teamfor many years,
 so coordinating with himis easiest for me.
 But Shikamaru…
 But, if we fight against each other,you might be stronger.
 I might have given up fightingagainst you too.
 And you’re you…
 But…
 Shikamaru…has always…
 Shikamaru has alwaysbelieved in me…
 Choji…are you ready?!
 He believed that I was really strong!
 That’s why he left it up to me alone!
 Just as I thought…
 So everybody thinks that…But…I know…
 More than myself or Nejior any of us here…
 He is stronger!
 And…I believe it.
 Oh? Pretty impressive Chakra.
 But…it’s a far cryfrom being a main dish…
 Let's go, fatso!
 Don’t YOU say that!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a personbroken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around (round around)
 Shake shake shakeLet’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 I can't move because of the pain.
 I didn't think the side effectsof the secret pill would be strong.
 What do I do?I only have one more pill.
 But if I take it, if I take it,I will…surely…

 Zero Hour!The Destruction of		the Hidden Leaf Village Begins!
 Lord Hokage!
 Leave it to me!
 Lord Kazekage!What is going on?
 Lord Hokage!
 Gaara!
 Squad One, above.
 Squad Two, below!Protect the lords!
 You’re in the way!
 Lord Hokage… 					Please…flee…
 It’s finally our time tocome on the scene.
 We’ve been transformedsuch a long time.
 I’m totally pent up with frustration.
 You guys smell all sweaty!
 Come on, we’re all comrades, right…?
 Sound Ninja…!
 Raido…
 We’re heading out toback up Lord Hokage.
 Be careful of any traps!
 Do it…
 Yes sir!
 – Ninja Art! 					– Ninja Art!
 – Four Flames Formation!– Four Flames Formation!
 Barrier…!
 Lord Kazekage…
 Barrier Ninjutsu, huh?!
 To think that they could outwit Anbu…
 They're not just ordinary…
 What are you doing here?!Lord Hokage is in danger!
 What a nuisance…
 To think that the enemy wasmasquerading as our Anbu…
 So it was also that guywho used Genjutsu!
 Yeah…there’s no mistake.
 I didn’t expect that…
 Sand Village would betray Leaf Village.
 The treaty is simply a camouflage tomake the enemy let down their guard.
 The petty little battle game ends now.
 From this point on, the courseof history will change!
 Are you saying thatyou’re starting a war?
 That’s right.
 One should avoid resolutionthrough armed force
 and should rather seeka solution through negotiations.
 There’s still time…Lord Kazekage!
 Perhaps one gets addicted topeace as one grows older…
 Sarutobi Sensei!
 You’re…
 Just my bad luck…
 to have lookout dutyon a day like this.
 I wanted to watch Chunin Exam too.
 Stop fussing.
 The Chunin Exam takesplace twice a year.
 You’ll have many more chancesto see it.
 But this year, that kid fromthe Uchiha Clan is taking part, right?
 And I won’t havea chance to see that…
 I won’t be able to die peacefully.
 What’s that?!
 It’s time! Begin!
 The Summoning has succeeded.
 Huge boa!
 Notify Lord Hokage immediately!
 I’m not letting you in the village!
 Dispatch the reinforcements immediately!
 Yes sir!
 Sand Ninja!
 What’s going on?
 Stop that, Gaara!
 I’ll kill him…!
 There’s no meaning incontinuing this fight!
 Don’t forget our mission!
 Out of my way…!
 What are you guys doing?!
 The operation is already underway!
 What in the world is going on?
 Gaara!
 What’s the matter?!
 His wound is deeper thanI thought!
 And moreover his Chakrais pretty drained!
 In that case,what about using that thing…?
 That’s impossible to do right away!
 Idiot! It’s all becauseyou didn’t wait for the signal
 and tried to becomethe Perfect Possession…
 What should we do?!
 Are you saying we have to dothis without Gaara?
 Isn’t Gaara here yet?!
 Gaara is Sand’s trump card.
 We have to get Gaara to do his work,no matter what!
 You guys leave for the moment andtend to Gaara’s wounds!
 As soon as Gaara’s Chakra hasbeen restored…
 the operation will recommence!
 Got it!
 What about you, Sensei?!
 I’m gonna suppress those guys!
 Do you think things willgo according to your plan?
 I’ll make them so…
 Go!
 Okay!
 Is Orochimaru the host of this party?
 Dunno… In any case,let’s heat this thing up.
 Sasuke…
 Sorry, but the Chunin Exam ends here.
 You’ve already achieved Chunin level.
 If you’re a Leaf Shinobi,be of service to the Leaf!
 In other words, I’m supposed totake down that jerk Gaara, right?
 A continuation of earlier on, right?
 Don’t pursue too far.
 From here on, it’s no longer an exam.lt’s the real thing!
 What I have to do though…is the same!
 I won’t let him through!
 Sasuke…!
 Boy oh boy…
 We intended to take Sasukewhile Gaara was causing the trouble.
 But not everything goes as planned.
 I see… Is that so?
 So Leaf Village and…Sasuke were the target, huh?
 Is the Leaf such a big catch?
 More importantly,if Gaara wakes up,
 I’ll be able to show you somethingmuch more interesting.
 Well, anyway…
 Your thick-headedness has causedthe Leaf to be outmaneuvered.
 It’s my win.
 Nothing is decideduntil the very end.
 I believe that’s what I taught you…
 Orochimaru.
 I thought this day wouldeventually arrive.
 However…
 You won’t get my head that easily!
 I told you, didn’t I?
 It is preferable to decidethe Fifth Hokage quickly…
 Third Hokage…
 because you will…die here.
 I wonder how the Chunin Examsare going?
 I wonder if Naruto’s match is over yet?
 The first match waswith Neji, right?
 I want him to win thatmatch somehow or other.
 That’s no good!
 A teacher mustn’t root forone particular student!
 All the graduating studentsare dear to him!
 I must root for all of them equally!
 But I still…want Naruto to win…
 Are you worried about Naruto?
 Well, of course…!
 As I thought…
 Y-You guys…
 I told you to do ten laps aroundthe school grounds, didn’t I?!
 We finished that long ago.
 While you were daydreaming, Sensei.
 When our teacher is in that state,he can’t teach a class!
 So let’s call it quits for today!
 N-No, no!I’m continuing with class.
 I wonder what that smoke is…?
 That’s coming from the directionof the exam arena…
 Isn’t there some disturbanceto the east?
 I wonder if something happened?
 That Orochimaru…
 What should we do?
 Should we send reinforcements?
 No… It’s dangerous to make a movewhen we don't really know
 what the situation is.
 If the mastermind is Orochimaru…
 even more so.
 Is Orochimaru…that dangerous a guy?
 Originally…he was a studentof the Third Hokage.
 So why did he become a Rogue Ninja?
 Long ago, when the Fourth Hokagewas decided…
 Orochimaru apparently asserted thathe was capable of taking on that role.
 But his request was denied.
 And shortly afterwards,that guy slipped out of this village.
 Orochimaru most likely holdsa grudge against
 the Third Hokage because of that.
 Revenge…is it?
 Probably.
 Long ago, when I was a kid…
 there’s one thing I rememberthinking when I saw that guy…
 That he didn’t seem human…
 That he seems to be somethingthat just took on a human form…
 Frightening…
 Simply…frightening.
 Reporting!
 A large boa has appeared nearthe eastern gate of the Leaf Village!
 And behind it, some one hundredSand Ninja are infiltrating the country!
 They are currently engaged inarmed conflict with our Shinobi
 who were patrolling nearby!
 The Sand…?!
 Leave Squad One and Two behindand make for the eastern gate.
 Immediately!
 – Yes sir! 					– Yes sir!
 We won’t let you past this point!
 There’s quite a large number.
 We were careless!
 And even Lord Hokage has been…
 Kakashi! Look inside the Barrier!
 Yeah.
 What…?
 Orochimaru!
 Orochimaru?!
 Why is that guy…?
 Don’t tell me thatthey’re after Sasuke again?!
 Sasuke!
 Huh?
 He’s not there…?
 Sakura, stay there for a while.
 I’m gonna go reducethe number of enemies.
 Darn! I’m worried aboutLord Hokage, but…
 Leave above to Anbu.
 Besides…
 Lord Hokage isn’t the kind of guywho can be taken down that easily.
 But…
 After all, he is the Hokage ofthe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Are you so happy, you’re crying?
 Or…
 do you have an iota of sadnessin your heart to kill me, your teacher?
 No…
 Since earlier on, I was feeling so sleepy…
 but I’m finally awake.
 That’s what I thought.
 I know you aren’t someonewho would hold a grudge.
 You have neither a goal nor motive.
 Hmm… I guess…
 I do kind of have a goal.
 If I were to explain it…
 It’s interesting to watch thingsthat move.
 I get no pleasure ifsomething doesn’t move.
 Like a windmill that doesn’t turn…
 Well, it may have some kindof appeal once in a while.
 But usually,it’s not worth looking at it.
 Right now…with a wind called“Destroy the Leaf Village,”
 I want to turn that windmill.
 You’re the same as always…
 Sakura!
 It was worth teaching you Genjutsusurvival training
 during the Genin Exam.
 You truly have a talent for it.
 Huh?
 Release the Genjutsu andwake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
 Naruto will be delighted.
 He’ll be getting a missionafter such a long while.
 What do you mean by a mission?
 Be careful…

 No!

 S-Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!

 But it would be best for her
 to have a complete examinationback at the village hospital.
 It was a big help havingyou here, Sakura.
 You should also getsome first-aid treatment, Sensei.
 Right… Thanks.
 Okay, please show me.
 They’ve been like this the whole time.
 It doesn’t look like they’ll wake upfrom the Genjutsu
 for quite a while…
 Well, I guess that servesour interests better. Hm?
 It’s…!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Oh! Thank goodness you look okay!
 Y-Yes…
 She’s not okay!
 Wha--?!
 I gave her some first-aid treatment,but she has a deep wound.
 We must get back to the village quickly…
 Don’t worry about me.
 I’m more concerned aboutYakumo’s instability.
 Yeah, their comrades couldvery well return.
 I’m also concerned about
 how we haven’t seen the three peoplewho were assigned to guard Yakumo.
 All right!
 Leave this to me and all of youhead back to the village
 with Kurenai and Yakumo!
 Organize a back-up unit.
 Your opponents are practitionersof Genjutsu.
 Will you be okay alone?
 What?
 This fully…
 …trained body!
 I would cram by the likesof the Kurama Clan’s Genjutsu!
 A pun?
 Oh?
 Are you awake?
 Hey, do you resent Kurenai Senseifor sealing your Genjutsu?!
 That person hates me…
 She didn’t want to make me intoa practitioner of Genjutsu.
 It’s not like that!
 Then…why?!
 I’m sure she had some kindof reason!
 You would’ve been in troublehad Kurenai Sensei
 not risked her life to save you before!
 That was the Kurama Clan…People from the same clan as me.
 What?
 Why would peoplefrom the same clan as you…?
 Kiba, could you take Kurenai Senseiback to the village?
 I’m fine…I can at least do that myself.
 Kiba?!
 Hey, Kurenai Sensei?!
 Tell us the truth!
 Isn’t this incident and youquitting our squad…
 somehow related?
 The Kurama Clan intowhich Yakumo was born…
 was once a force inthe Village Hidden in the Leaves
 as a family of Genjutsu users.
 However, they had been broughtto ruin in recent years,
 unable to turn out Chunin and Jonin.
 Then a rising star brimming withtalent appeared in the clan.
 And that was Yakumo.
 My parents and relatives placedtheir hopes in me,
 the only daughter ofthe head family.
 But I was in poor health andmy official entrance into the Academy
 was not acknowledged.
 I had wanted to live upto the expectations
 of my parents and the clan…
 and I got really depressed.
 My father saw me like that
 and negotiated directly withthe Third Hokage for me.
 The Third Hokage whomMurakumo consulted
 realized the high level ofYakumo’s latent power
 and decided to leave herin my custody.
 By the order of the Third Hokage,
 Kurenai Sensei becamemy personal teacher.
 But…
 Y-Yakumo?!
 Kurenai Sensei… She…!
 Why?!
 I don't know.
 Maybe since I’m a Genjutsu user too,
 I got jealous of the high levelof Yakumo’s latent powers.
 Jealous…?!
 Genjutsu practitioners withhigher powers than mine
 are not necessary in this village.
 No way. You’d do that fora reason like that…?
 You understand, don’t you?
 A selfish person like me can’t continueto go on missions
 with your lives entrusted to me.
 I can’t believe that!
 It’s not just her…I’m a hindrance to the Leaf Village.
 Wh-What do you mean?
 I just can’t believe it.
 Isn’t Kurenai Sensei still hidingsomething from us…?
 I also…get that feeling.
 Exactly.
 It’s because…
 Kurenai Sensei’s hand shookwith heartache
 when she talked about eventsin the past.
 But the shaking stopped…when she talked about her motive.
 What do you mean?
 That motive is a lie.
 The heart is not affected bya made-up story.
 Then her being jealous of Yakumo…
 Perhaps she’s protecting someone.
 Someone so importantKurenai Sensei would protect?
 That would be, for example…
 I overheard Kurenai Senseiand the Third Hokage talking.
 Yakumo’s powers probablywill not awaken for a long while.
 I see. But the time will eventually come
 when the dam bursts andher powers will pour out.
 That power of the Kurama Clanwill eventually threaten
 the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 At that time,we’ll have to eliminate it.
 Even the Third Hokage wasinvolved with the sealing of my powers.
 The Third Hokage wouldnever order something like that!
 My parents died just before
 I started training underKurenai Sensei.
 There was a sudden fire.
 It seems the fire spread quicklyand they couldn’t be saved…
 But my parents were even Jonin!
 To think they would diejust in a fire.
 And a fire in broad daylighton top of that…
 And after that, although I was toldthere was no foul play…
 the autopsy reports wereclassified and sealed.
 No way?!lt wasn’t just an ordinary fire?
 My parents were killed onorder of the Third Hokage…!
 No way…!No way could that ever be true!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall,I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joywithout a shape
 This big dream of mine thatcannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true,even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because ofwhat we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward,never looking away
 Even if I’m told thatthere is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away,lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching forthe answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by,with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 The story I heard from the girl.
 The story I heard fromKurenai Sensei.
 Which one is true?lt’s unlikely that they’re all lying.
 But I can say this.
 There’s no way the Third Hokagewould think about eliminating the girl.
 For the time being,
 I’ve got to get Sensei andthe others to the hospital quick--!

 I’m totally fine, now.
 Nothing to it!
 I see.
 Ayame!
 Yes!
 Here you go.
 Pops?
 Just eat it.
 The final round is tomorrow, right?
 Okay, then.
 Thanks!
 You’ve got a daughter at home,so it’s not so bad, right?
 Most of my money vanisheswith the food expenses.
 Moron. Your home is special, right?
 Huh?
 Girls are a drag.
 Yeah. There are times when I reallydon’t get how to act with her.
 Father’s have it rough…
 Hah, am I the only bad guy?
 Hey, master.
 Let me have everythingon these two pages, too!
 Welcome!
 Oh! Strong reinforcements!
 Come on. You order something, too!
 Hey…Dad.
 Hmm?
 Hey! Let’s go home, already!
 Excuse me?
 Shut up. You’re supposed tolive it up at a festival!
 Festival, my butt…
 What a drag.
 You idiot… Since olden times…
 the final round’sbeen like a festival!
 I’m in that final round tomorrow.
 Jeez, don’t make come to get you.
 You’re…in it?
 Please, Dad…
 Tomorrow, eh…
 Yeah.
 Tomorrow…is a full moon…
 To think you didn’t evenget a scratch…
 Perfect, eh, Neji?
 That’s enough warm-up exercise…
 Shall we get going?
 I was nervous and couldn’t sleep.
 First…it’s him…in the first match.
 Quite honestly…even my Sharingancan’t see through his Tenketsu!
 The strongest man in theLeaf is on my team.
 It is that…Neji Hyuga!
 Neji…Neji…Neji…
 At last…
 The first match is Neji Hyuga, right?!
 Yeah. He’s the number one rookiefrom last year, right?!
 We can’t miss the first match!
 Neji…Hyuga…
 Now I can summon a frog…lt’ll be okay.
 They all…look nasty.
 Hinata!
 Yipes! N-N-Naruto.
 W-What are you doing here?
 Today is the final round, isn’t it?
 I… Just something…
 I came to check out this training field.
 This is the place whereI became Genin, so…
 Really? W-Why?
 N-Nothing…That doesn’t matter!
 Y-You’re right. I’m sorry.
 Say, Hinata…
 Neji’s a relative of yours, right?
 Y-Yes.
 Is he really strong …?
 Yes…
 I see.
 B-But you might be able to win, Naruto.
 Yeah. I’m strong, after all!
 I bet you can win, Naruto.
 What?
 You know…
 I…when you cheered for me,
 I felt like I was able to becomestronger than before.
 Hinata! Hang tough!
 When the preliminaries ended,
 I became able to likemyself just a little.
 I'll…
 stand…
 by my own…
 words.
 That is my way of Ninja.
 From someone else's standpoint,it might not look like anything’s changed…
 but I feel like I was able to change.
 I’ve been thinking that it was…thanks to you, Naruto.
 Say, Hinata…
 Did you really think so?
 What?
 I may look strong to you,
 but all I do is mess up…
 And I act tough becauseI’m frustrated.
 It’s not like that!
 Even when you messed up,
 in my view…you were alwaysa proud failure.
 W-When I look at you,it impacts my heart.
 You’re not perfect, so…
 So…
 It’s because you mess up…
 that you have the strengthto rise up from that.
 I think such strength istrue strength.
 I…I think you’re anincredibly strong person.
 Thanks, Hinata!
 Even though I was alwaysthe bottom one…
 I was tense in the shoulders, somehow!
 I was depressed,which was totally not my character.
 But I feel better now!
 Naruto…
 Okay! I’m off to the match!
 Hinata…
 Huh?
 I kind of…thought you were…
 W-What…?
 …gloomy, hesitant and weird.
 Naruto…
 But I quite like…people…
 like you!
 …like you!
 Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch mekick that Neji’s butt!
 Uh-oh. Time to run!
 I-I’m late, late!
 See you later, Hinata!
 Sorry I’m late, Hinata.
 Well, Shino’s match isn’t untilquite a bit later, so…
 Hm? Hey? Hinata?
 Hmm? W-What?
 Oh, it’s starting!
 Move, move!
 C'mon, move!
 Dang it! There’s quite a distance!
 I won’t make it!
 Brother Naruto!
 Konohamaru?!
 I’ve come to aid in brother’s crisis, here!
 Konohamaru…What’re you doing here?!
 I’ll tell you later!
 This way, here!
 There’s an ace shortcut whereyou can get straight to the arena, here!
 What?!
 All right!Well done, Konohamaru!
 Those who control thesecret path control time.
 Oh, I see!You’re awesome, Konohamaru!
 As I recall, there’s a holein the wall around here…
 Oh!
 Here it is!
 Oh!
 What’s the matter, Konohamaru?
 The secret path has been repaired, here!
 Whaat…?
 Oh! There’s no time!
 Brother!
 Next approach!
 Look! I’m really out of time.
 It’s a secret, but there’san awesome path
 that can get you inside the arenain an instant, here!
 What?! All right!Well done, Konohamaru!
 This hole is a shortcut?
 It’s a straight shot tothe final round arena!
 No doubt, here!
 Straight shot, huh? 					Okay!
 Let’s hurry!
 Yeah!
 Konohamaru!What’s happening here?!
 It’s okay, here!
 We’re almost to the finalround arena, here!
 See? There’s the exit, here!
 Oh, oh.
 What?!
 Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot!
 T-This is…some kind of mistake!
 Kooonooohaaamaaaruuu!
 What the heck are you doing?!
 We’ve gotten furtherand further away!
 Until just recently,
 it was connected to thefinal round arena, here.
 Next approach, right away…
 This is it!
 If you ride this, you’ll get to thefinal round arena just like that, here!
 Huh? A bull?
 Think again, brother.
 A feudal lord Bull is not at all inthe same league as ordinary cows, here.
 Once they start running,even race horses grow deathly pale.
 There’s no way they can beata no-nonsense feudal lord cow!
 Anyway, it’s an awesome cow!
 Brother, if you leave the rest to this cow,
 it’s just a short run tothe final round arena, here!
 Then, I’m counting on you.
 Okay, let’s go!
 Huh? Wha--?!
 Ouch!
 What?
 Brother, go for it, here!
 Hey! Stop! Stop!
 Hey-hey, we’re missing quitea few people.
 What’s going on?lt’s going to start.
 What’s the meaning of this?Sasuke…?
 And even Naruto…
 Why is it?!
 This is bad!
 That's it!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Guys! Scatter the rampaging cows!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 What’s wrong with you guys?Why are you back, hey?!
 More appeared!
 The escape path was blocked!
 It won’t do any good to multiply!
 Hmm? What the--?!
 Naruto Uzumaki…?
 We leave the rest to you!
 Whoa, let us in, quick!
 Hey!
 Entry has already…!
 What kind…of entrance isthis kid making…?
 Naruto.
 He’s totally late.
 What a drag.
 Guys, run! A large herd ofstampeding bulls is coming.
 Huh? What are you talking about?
 Jeez! I’m serious.So many of them…!
 Huh? Hey… 					Where's Sasuke?
 The Dosu guy I’m supposedto fight isn’t here, either.
 Hey, you guys there.
 Don’t be restless.
 Throw out your chests andshow your faces to the spectators!
 You guys are the stars ofthis “final round.”
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling,so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devoteshis time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling,so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Hey Hinata!
 Keep your eyes open and watch medefeat this unpleasant guy!
 He goes and decides thata person's life path can't be changed…
 Destiny is decided when one is born?Don't kid me!
 People definitely can change.
 By defeating this guy,I'll prove that!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Tenten vs. Temari
 The fifth battle…
 Tenten, Temari…come forward!
 Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
 Now…The second one fromthe Land of Sand, huh…
 Do your best!
 – Tenten!– It looks like it's going to be interesting.
 Begin!
 Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru
 Go for it, Tenten!
 Believe in your own strength, Tenten!
 We’re behind you, Tenten!
 Knock her with all your strength!
 That’s good!
 Cheer her on more, more,more with passion, Lee!
 Yeah!
 These guys are noisy!
 That spacing is just what I’d expectfrom Tenten,
 not too close, not too far.
 Attacks or defense,she can respond to either one.
 What happened?
 Please begin.
 Are you planning to wait out andsee how I make my move?
 Let me just tell you,
 once I start my attackyou’ll be over in a second.
 You’re trying to be cool andsee what I do first…
 A hundred years too early!
 It doesn’t matter to me, come first.
 You said it…
 Well, I won’t hold back.
 They missed?
 That’s impossible!
 What happened?ls that a warm-up?
 Or are you scared and your aim is off?
 I thought I would enjoy ita little bit more,
 but evidently it’s not promising.
 No way!
 I can’t believe Tenten’s attack missed!
 It’s unbelievable indeed.
 Tenten’s weapons...
 always hits the markten out of ten times.
 There no reason for them to miss.
 That’s right...She didn’t miss.
 She was made to miss.
 As always, she’s being disagreeable.
 How foolish…
 How disgraceful!
 Huh?
 Sand wins again.
 We don’t know that yet.
 We know.
 How? 					How do we know?
 Explain it so I understand!
 Stupid... As if I'd dosuch a bothersome thing.
 Shikamaru said it so,surely that’s how it is.
 These guys are hard to understand.
 Calm down…
 Don’t let her get to you…
 One.
 Two.
 Three…
 If it’s gonna get dodged,
 I just have to makeit impossible to!
 So she’s measuring the spacing,next one is going to be the big attack.
 I get it…
 So, that fan is the secret.
 If so…
 How about…this?!
 No way!
 My flying weapons!
 Is there a secret mechanismin the fan…?
 This is…
 the first star.
 There are two more.
 When the third star appears,
 you will lose.
 Tenten!
 Don’t be taken in byyour opponent, be calm!
 Be calm!
 I know…
 Lee, I really intended to usethis in the main battle,
 not the preliminary round--
 but it looks like I can’t do it that way.
 She’s already going to use it?
 Pulling out two scrolls?
 What does she intend to do?
 Hah! No matter what you do,it won’t work.
 Rising Twin Dragons!
 Even if you increase the amount,it’s still the same!
 Second star!
 I’m not done yet!
 Did I do it?
 Third star.
 She disappeared!
 Where is she?
 I’m over here!
 Darn--!
 Ninja Art!
 Wind Scythe Jutsu!
 Tenten!
 Chakra is enfolded in that wind.
 Huh?!
 Tenten fought well…
 But she won’t be able to escape fromthat twister.
 T-That’s awful.
 Tenten…!
 How boring... really.
 To think she completely interceptedTenten’s weapon attacks.
 This is ridiculous!
 What’s going on with her…?
 It’s just like Shikamaru said,it’s the Sand’s win.
 That’s why I said it.
 There’s no reason for us to lose here.
 The Land of Sand is to be feared…
 Temari wins the fifth battle.
 Oh no!
 Nice catch.
 What are you doing?!
 Is that something you do toan opponent who fought to the utmost?!
 You’re annoying!
 Take that trash away already!
 Stop! Lee!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 What?!
 You’re just like you look…
 You’re dull too.
 What did you say?!
 Stop! Lee!
 Guy Sensei!
 Temari.
 Come up quick, you’ve beendeclared the winner.
 Don’t keep company with that awful-lookingguy and his chaperone forever.
 What…?!
 That’s enough, Lee.
 Gentlemen of Sand…
 I wonder if I may give youa word of warning.
 This kid is strong.
 You should prepare yourselves.
 Picking a fight with the Sand…
 I absolutely wouldn't want todo it with those guys.
 T-They’re all awesome guys…
 Don’t lose to those guys!
 Naruto!
 S-Sakura.
 Sakura… Are you okay already?
 Never mind that,you should worry about yourself!
 Huh? Me? I don’t havean injury or anything.
 That’s not what I mean.
 If you lose here, it’s a point of dishonor.
 You’d be ashamed to face Sasuke!
 Y- Yeah.
 And…
 Thanks for earlier…
 No!
 Sakura!
 You did your hardestto get here!
 You’ll disgrace women ifyou lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
 If it weren’t for your stupid cheeringat that time…
 I would have been soundlybeaten by Ino.
 Yeah, that's right.
 Y-You!
 Okay, hurry hurry! 					Me next!
 Next! 					Next is my turn!
 Shikamaru Nara vs. Tsuchi Kin
 Darn!
 It’s me.
 Shikamaru, don’t lose!
 – Show us that you’re a real man!– All right, all right.
 Get her with the 16 combo, go!
 – Win Shikamaru!– Ino’s become super energetic.
 You go for it!
 That guy manipulates shadows.
 Be careful of the shadows…
 I won’t be beaten bya stupid technique like that.
 Shikamaru!
 Bash that one around!And while you're at it...
 Man, what a pain.
 Furthermore, my opponent is a woman…lt's hard to get to it.
 If that’s what you think,I’ll end this quickly.
 Go, go! Shikamaru!
 Well, you could say thatI know these guys’ raw power
 from that incident from the second test…
 I don’t know anything about this one’s Jutsu.
 On top of that, she’s seen my Jutsu…
 – The sixth battle.– That being said, for me…
 Shikamaru versus Kin!
 Begin!
 I can only do this.
 One trick pony, huh…?
 Shut up!
 Ninja Art, Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 That Jutsu!
 It’s nothing if I just pay attentionto the movement of your shadow!
 Bells…?
 Heh, that’s a classic.
 Next, you’ll throw Senbons with bells
 and Senbons without bellsat the same time, right?
 I’ll respond to the sound of the bells,intending to dodge them.
 But I won't notice the quiet Senbons,and, ouch.
 Is that right?
 You’re a chatty guy!
 So in order to not get caughtby the shadow Senbons…
 I'm alert to the trickand look closely…
 What?!
 Behind?!
 String?
 Darn it!
 Too late!
 Shikamaru!
 He took that pretty bad.
 It wasn’t tat bad, look closely.
 Huh?
 F-For the moment I dodged a fatal hit.
 Now it’s my turn!
 That’s not going to happen.
 W-What’s this?
 That happens to anyonewho hears my bell.
 The sound vibration ofthis special bell
 reaches the brain directlyfrom the ear drum.
 And then it will make you hallucinate.
 It’s useless!
 You can’t avoid the sound ofmy bell by doing...
 that... that... that... that... that...
 Shoot! Which one?Which is the real one?
 You can’t do anything, can you?
 Your shadow, which was your faint hope,doesn’t even know where to stretch to…
 Well… I’ll cook you slowly.
 Taking me lightly…!
 This time it’s five,next time seven…
 I’ll continue until you becomea hedgehog.
 Y-You’re lying, you brat!
 Huh?!
 You’d end it soon…
 That’s what you saidin the beginning, isn’t it?
 I see, you can’t endure the painand want to be eased.
 Well, I’ll finish it here.
 It’s your death warrant.
 W-What?!
 M-My body…
 At last, Shadow Possession Jutsuis a success.
 W-What are you saying?
 No way!Your shadow isn’t anywhere...
 You don’t realize it yet?
 I-It can’t be…
 It's just that, you fool!
 A thread at this heightcan’t have a shadow.
 I can stretch and shrinkmy own shadow.
 The shadow is gradually getting thicker.
 This wasn’t the shadow of the thread…
 That's right. I stretched my shadowand made it narrow,
 so it looked like the shadow ofa thread and stuck it on you.
 But… How do you win with that?
 I’m just gonna movethe same way as you.
 Annoying.
 Be quiet and watch.
 Stupid!
 If you continue like this and attack…
 You, too, 					will be wounded!
 I know that.
 No way! You're...!
 We’re gonna throw shurikenat each other.
 How far will we go…?
 Fool, stop it!
 You're only talk...
 And that one's a goner.
 If you’re a shinobi,
 you have to grasp the situationand the layout when you battle.
 Even though we madethe same movements…
 the distance of the walls behindeach of us was different.
 I just used the shuriken and
 called attention awayfrom the wall behind us.
 Winner! Shikamaru Nara.
 Good job Shikamaru!
 Cool!
 Me next…
 Me next… Me next…!
 That guy’s dull and plain,but that was kinda cool.
 Shoot!
 I’m the only one left.
 And the next match.
 The people left are one Sound ninja,
 me, Hinata, Naruto, Choji, Neji and Lee.
 And that Sand guy…
 Just please spare me from that guy.
 This year’s rookie looks quite challenging…
 Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka
 It’s here, it’s here, it’s here!
 What we’ve been waiting for!
 It’s finally my turn!
 Yeah! Lucky us!
 If it’s this guywe’ll absolutely win, Akamaru!
 Yahoo!
 – If I’m not next, Sakura will despise me...– I'm gonna do it!
 – and call me Bushy Brow.– I'm gonna go for it!
 – If I’m not next. Sakura will...– Just watch me! Yay!
 This Lee kid, he’s just likeGuy was in the past…
 Do your best, Naruto.
 Leave it to me.
 Well Naruto, show us…
 how much you’ve grown.
 I’m going to do it!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is insidethis hand
 when you want to cry,and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Darn that Kiba!
 I hold back a little bit andhe rides my brain.
 Yap, yap, yap, yap,it’s annoying! Believe it!
 Just quit talking tough, and use your dogor whatever, and come at me!
 I don’t know what kind oftraining you’ve done,
 but I’m the man who’s goingto become Hokage.
 You’re the one who’s goingto get his butt kicked.

 8 Trigrams 2 Palms!
 4 Palms!
 8 Palms!
 16 Palms!
 32 Palms!
 64 Palms!
 What’s going on?!
 A golden body surface…?
 It’s the same material as the weaponhe spit out of his mouth earlier…
 That was close.
 I hear that if you’re hit straight onwith Gentle Fist,
 your Chakra Network gets damaged
 and you become unableto build up Chakra…
 That was close.
 Are you a monster?
 It seems to comenot just from your mouth.
 Gum Style Spider Thread…
 is a metal that hardensthe instant it leaves my body.
 Moreover, it doesn’t let Chakra through.
 And…it can be secretednot just from my mouth,
 but also from the sweat glandsthroughout my body.
 Attacks on Chakra points won’t work.Now it makes sense…
 The Spider Web Net won’t work.
 And there’ll be no close-rangecombat fighting
 against a Gentle Fist opponent.
 In other words,
 I just have to attack the blind sidefrom long distance.
 There’ll be no sound…lt’ll be in a flash.
 The game’s over.
 The Kunai Knife is a fake!
 What?!
 8 Trigrams Palm…
 Rotation!
 Wha–?! What is that?!
 Does he…have eyes behind him?!
 And the defense just now…
 He repelled physical attackswith Chakra?!
 360 Degrees of Vision:The Byakugan's Blind Spot!
 If we’re not prepared for“one person, one kill,”
 then it’s not going to work out…
 That’s what you said earlier.
 Hurry up and go!I’ll catch up with you all!
 We have to be prepared for“one person, one kill.”
 Naruto…
 You’ve got better eyes than me.
 Neji…
 Catch up with us, no matter what!
 Can he see me?!
 What the heck is he?!
 I know you’re there.
 Come out.
 Those eyes…
 It seems they can do morethan just see through the Chakra flow…
 So I see there wasan extraordinary Visual Jutsu user.
 A long range battleis unfavorable…
 I must bring this toclose combat by all means.
 Very well.
 I’ll acknowledge that this game hasa somewhat high level of difficulty!
 I too shall go for it seriously…
 It’s like he’s a totally different personfrom before…
 His Chakra activity is overwhelming.
 And those markings…
 His move earlier…
 He dodged an attack aimedfrom behind
 and was able to see me hidingin the shadows.
 In other words,
 he has a combined wide rangeof sight and X-ray vision.
 And what’s more, that Jutsu…
 If so…
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Your ability…
 I’ll find a way to impeccably assault it.
 If he defendsagainst physical attacks
 with a large emissionof Chakra and its Rotation…
 all I need to do then is to stopthat Chakra Rotation!
 Scatter!
 Rotation!
 It’s starting to stop.
 Here!
 Die!
 He released the Chakra just in timeand repelled the Kunai Knife!
 To think he’d stop my Chakra Rotation
 by binding it with Chakra threads…
 These things…
 I just have to cut them for now.
 If the Rotation won’t do,
 then I just have to dodgeeach and every one.
 This guy usesclose-range Taijutsu-style combat .
 There will be no problemif I fight him from afar.
 In that way…I’ll have a good long look at your ability.
 8 Trigrams, 64 Palms!
 What a number!
 Hm?! His stance changed?!
 8 Trigrams.
 128 Palms!
 He’s fast!The number of strikes has doubled…!
 If I get nailed by that straight on,it'll be the end for me.
 If that’s the case on his end,
 then it’ll be a battle of numberson this end, too!
 The number’s too great!I won’t have enough time!
 The Rotation’s no good,just as I thought…
 It seems he has 360-degree vision.
 And it seems he dealswith enemy attacks
 by combining his X-ray vision abilityfor seeing through things
 and his telescopic vision abilityfor long-distance sight.
 Furthermore, althoughhe’s got 360-degree vision,
 that vision has a formidable extent…
 If I were to determine the rangefrom his reaction before…
 he almost unfailingly detectedthe Kunai Knives
 that entered the approximately150-foot circumference around him.
 But for some reason,
 there are Kunai Kniveshe can’t evade completely.
 If so…
 8 Trigrams, Sixty…
 I see…
 This time, there’ll be even more.
 This time, two will hit…
 I’ve found a way to impeccablyassault your ability!
 It seems that defense technique
 was something to compensatefor this weak point!
 In other words...Your Visual Jutsu isn’t perfect!
 Why even bother?!I’ve won the game!
 Come on. Are you going tokeep at it for naught?
 The fate of the small fry character in aneasy game is to be destroyed right away!
 You can’t beat me!
 – I-I’m not done yet.– Lee…
 You never give up do you?
 No way you can beat him.He’s a genius unlike you.
 Genius? What is genius anyway!
 Even without any talent,I’ll surpass “genius” by working hard.
 It’s no use, Lee.
 No matter how hard you work,you cannot beat me.
 It’s already decided.
 Lady Hinata...
 You’re the sheltered little babyof the main branch.
 A person can never change.
 And then, this match…
 Your destiny was decided at the pointwhen I became your opponent.
 You don’t know until you try!
 This is the end…
 Gentle Fist!
 Small fry character one…Destruction completed.
 Well, for a crummy game,I was entertained…
 Heh… I missed the fatal spots, huh?
 And he wouldn’t easily die fromKunai Knives from 150 feet away, eh?
 I see…He’s still going to entertain me, huh?
 This is thanks for that.
 Seriously, that fat Jirobocan’t be helped,
 but what’s that clod Kidomarudoing anyway…?
 That lowlife!
 He’s got the habit of playing games.
 Maybe he’s found someoneto entertain him?
 When that idiot plays too much,
 he becomes hyperand easily gets into that state…
 But still...Once he gets to the second state…
 it’s instant death for the opponent.
 Maximum destructive power…with 100% accuracy!
 Die!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it wasa bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts,I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 He doesn’t carry out wasteful attacks.
 And he accurately readsinformation from the results.
 No mistake, this guy’s the strongestof all I’ve fought up until now!
 I probably won’t be ableto evade the next attack.
 I’ve had enough.I can’t dodge it anyway.
 Since the secret of my eyeshas been discovered, I won’t run or hide!

181,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 Byakugan!
 Why did you take down Narutowith her?!
 It was an accident…
 Had I not applied the finishing blowto her at the moment,
 we would’ve been in danger instead.
 I know of no instance
 of the Ninja Art: Kujakubeing defeated up until now…
 He will be missed.
 Hidden Leaf Shinobi,your mission is over.
 I still haven’t taken back the star.
 We’ll search for it by ourselves.Thank you for your help.
 Hoshikage: The Buried Truth
 Rest easy…I’m not an enemy.
 Come to think of it…What happened after I fell off the cliff?
 Could it be…?Did you save me, lady?
 Yes…
 I see.I don’t really remember, though…
 Well anyway, you saved me! Thanks.
 I’m Naruto, a Ninja fromthe Village Hidden in the Leaves and…
 Umm, I came to protect the star, but…
 You kind of stole it, lady…
 I’m Natsuhi…
 Natsuhi? What?I’ve heard that name before…
 Oh!
 That red star’s sure pretty.
 Natsuhiboshi…lt watches over me all the time.
 It’s the same nameas Natsuhiboshi.
 If I remember right,
 Sumaru said it’s a starthat protects him!
 Sumaru said that?
 Yeah! Say, lady…Do you know him?
 Sumaru is my child.
 What?! So, you’re Sumaru’s mom?!
 What?! Sumaru escaped?!
 I am very sorry.
 I was careless thinkingthe muscle relaxants were still in effect.
 Most likely the guys fromthe Hidden Leaf
 are the ones who took him away…
 What do we do?
 It’d be bad news if these circumstanceswere to be known
 by the Leaf, no,by those in our village.
 We’ve got to look high and lowfor Sumaru right away.
 There’s no need to get rattled…
 We can take care of them atour leisure after we find the star.
 I got it. If we tell the Village Hiddenin the Leaves something like
 they died during the mission…
 We could also convince Sumaru.
 I burned Natsuhi’s Chakrainto my memory…
 We’ll reach the star
 if we follow the remnantsof her Chakra.
 Naruto was…?
 Yeah. Along with the Kunoichiwho stole the star.
 But I didn’t see themin the Valley of Death…
 Are you saying they escaped fromthe valley
 where the poison gas swirls?
 Perhaps.
 If that’s the case,
 they might have crossed the borderand escaped safely to the forest…
 Hey, let’s all look for them!
 What’s the deal, guys?!
 Naruto helped all of you,didn’t he?!
 But if we don’t have an orderfrom Lord Akahoshi… Right?
 Yeah…
 We don’t have time to be waitingfor an order! I’m going!
 I’m going…
 I’ll go too, if it’s to look for Naruto.
 Mizura, you can’t.
 I want to be useful in some way.
 No… I’ll go.
 Sumaru?!
 You’re okay!
 We safely rescued him fromthe Hoshikage’s medical room
 where he was being held!
 What? Why was he inLord Hoshikage’s medical room?
 It wasn’t a Ninja fromsome other village
 who knocked you all outand took Sumaru away!
 Akahoshi, the leader of your villagewas the culprit!
 In other words, the Shinobiwho made off with the star
 and the Shinobi who attacked allof you were different people.
 That’s what Neji deducedword for word.
 Why would Lord Akahoshi…?
 Why would he do that to us?
 What does this mean, Sumaru?
 I don’t know, either!
 But it seems Lord Akahoshiis hiding something from us…
 Isn’t it about time you guys realized it?
 Akahoshi’s using you as he pleases.
 Mizura is not the exception.
 If you guys continuetraining this way,
 everyone will collapse and then…
 No way…
 It can’t be. That’s a lie!
 Lord Akahoshi is not thatkind of person, ever!
 Perhaps the Shinobiwho stole the star will tell the truth.
 Let’s find the Shinobi who disappeared,whatever the cost!
 The forest in the Land of Bearsis deep.
 If only outsiders go,they’d just get lost.
 Okay, work with us.
 So leave this to me.
 But…
 You rest now.
 At some point, the time will comewhen we’ll need your help.
 How about it, Akahoshi…?
 Were you able to get a lead onthe remnants of Natsuhi’s Chakra?
 This is good.
 I guess this is what’s calledgood old home-cooking.
 There’s more.
 One more bowl!
 But why’d you do something likesteal the star, Sumaru’s mom?
 This is not the first and only timeI took that away.
 Ten years ago as well…
 Huh…?
 Training utilizing that star was painfulfor many Shinobi at the time
 and even caused many deaths.
 My husband Hotarubi and Iwho survived the training…
 thought to seal the star to preventany more victims due to the training.
 A Tracking Unit immediately caught upwith us after we had stolen the star.
 Hold it!
 Lord Third Hoshikage…
 Hotarubi…Natsuhi…Your thoughts are reasonable…
 As it happens, I was also wavering.
 But in the position of Hoshikage,it was difficult to make a decision.
 I promise to terminatethe star training.
 But the hard-line factionof the Star Village
 might at some pointresume the training…
 You two must leave this village!
 I want you to keep an eye onthe village from the outside.
 And if it seems that the trainingwill begin once again…
 Please stop it withyour power.
 Lord Hoshikage…
 For Sumaru…
 Tell Sumaru that…we died.Please be good to him.
 Yes, I understand.
 Upon allowing us to leave the village,
 the Lord Third Hoshikage completelyprohibited the star training.
 Like us, the Third Hoshikagewas also distressed
 at the damage fromthe star training.
 Neji was also talking about that.
 But are the effects fromthe star that severe?!
 Yes. My husband Hotarubi dieddue to side effects
 a while after leaving the village…
 I might also die at any timefrom the effects.
 No way…
 Then let’s go back tothe village!
 Tell Akahoshi directly tostop the training!
 Akahoshi is a man who putsthe prosperity of the village
 ahead of the lives ofthe children.
 As proof of that,he has taken Sumaru hostage
 and has demanded thatI return the star.
 What?! Then the masked Ninjafrom that time was…
 Hold it!
 Farewell!
 Wh-What?!
 It was Akahoshi?!
 What is it, Sumaru’s mom?
 They’ve… 					Akahoshi has come.
 Is this the place?
 Where’s the star being hidden?
 Hotarubi… Please protectthe star, protect Sumaru…
 The star is under that rock…
 But it seems the entranceis sealed…
 What can we do witha boulder like this…?
 Our only choice is to blow it uplittle by little with Letter Bombs.
 I won’t let you do that!
 Wha--?!
 Didn’t this brat die inthe Valley of Death?
 I won’t be done in just like that,believe it!
 You guys step back.
 Then I just have to do it again.
 Ninja Art: Kujaku Beast!
 Here we go!
 You’re mine!
 I saw that move coming!Become a sacrifice for my beast!
 What?!
 Natsuhi… So you were alive too,after all, huh?
 Akahoshi, reconsider one more time…
 If you stop the star trainingand release the children,
 I’ll have no more to dowith the village…
 I don’t think so!
 The Third Hoshikage was stubborn
 and never waveredin his opposition.
 Opposition to those of uswho trained Star Ninja
 and attempted to bring prosperityto the village…
 No! As long as I,the Third Hoshikage, am alive,
 the resumption of that trainingwill never be allowed!
 Return to your posts… That is all.
 Have you lost your mind…
 Akahoshi?
 You’re the one who’s lost his mind!
 Rest easy and go tothe other world…
 Our generation willraise this village
 to rival that ofthe Five Great Hidden Villages…
 Was this…really okay?
 It was necessary for the sakeof the village, right?
 Exactly! We can do star trainingas we please.
 Unforgivable!
 What do you think of all thosewho are training frantically,
 believing in you guys?!
 One’s even on the verge of dying!Do you understand that?!
 Sacrifice is unavoidable forthe sake of village prosperity.
 A Shinobi is merely a tool for that.
 For the sake of village prosperity?
 Knock it off!
 All you’re doing is deceivingthe people in the village!
 This is a Star Village issue…I will settle this.
 B-But…!
 Step back!
 Yotaka, Shisou!
 Wha--?! He devouredhis comrades’ Chakra!
 My Chakra beast has a full stomach.
 Things won’t go as they did before.
 Talk is cheap!
 Sumaru’s mom…
 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 Neji, how’s Sumaru’s mom doing?
 She’s stable for now,
 but her condition can worsenat any moment.
 What?
 Her Chakra Network that hadalready been weakened
 due to the side-effects of the starbefore she received Akahoshi’s attack.
 In other words,her Chakra Network is all beat up?
 Hey, Granny Tsunadecould heal her, right?
 I don’t know.
 But either way,
 if she were to usethe Ninja Art: Kujaku any further,
 there’s no guarantee she’ll live.

 I’ll run toward the horizon,alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,

 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes usThe heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dreamI kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky withcountless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that…What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Where’s Naruto?
 It’s no good.I can’t find him.
 I see…
 He’s not close by anymore.
 Either he drifted away…
 or he has escaped.
 At any rate, with this fog…
 There’s no reason toremain here any longer.
 Let’s make it to a shore nearbyand start again.
 Understood.
 The Closed Door
 It’s been a while, Lord Orochimaru.
 It truly has.
 To think I’d stop by ona whim to find you still here.
 And it’s for that reason thatI am able to meet with you again.
 So does the fact thatyou’re here mean
 you're still continuing that research?
 Yes.
 And I think someday it will beof help to you, Lord Orochimaru…
 I wonder if that’s true.
 And all this is due to my loyalty.
 Do whatever you like…
 Thank you.
 By the way…
 is he the one you weretalking of earlier?
 Yes, he’s Itachi Uchiha’syounger brother.
 Oh really…
 Yes, my…
 Please don’t…
 say anything unnecessary!
 It appears that Narutois no longer close by.
 Hey…
 Naruto, surely he’s safe, isn’t he…?
 He can’t be beaten that easily.
 After all, he too is a Leaf Shinobi…
 Shiragiku Inn		 I’m responsible for guarding		the ships collecting funds.
 I’m Hitode.
 I know the circumstances,
 your colleague has disappearedand I’m sure that you’re worried…
 Have you receivedany information since then?
 I’m sorry, but there’s beenno information
 regarding a victim rescuedfrom a shipwreck.
 I see.
 However, I'm troubled.
 This is difficult to say,
 but the departure of the collection shipshas been pushed forward…
 Pushed forward?
 Now we’re scheduled toleave tomorrow morning.
 We apologize forour late notice.
 As expected,a large number of people find
 the relationship withLand of Water very important
 and we had to pushthe departure forward.
 I understand.
 But we’d like to take time here
 to seek and investigateour colleague…
 Of course.
 We’ll meet you directlyat the port tomorrow
 for the guard duty.
 Thank you for cooperating.
 Just one thing.
 Yes…
 As you can see, we arenot a very wealthy country.
 Fishermen and we areboth concerned
 about the disturbance ofthis Demon of the Ocean.
 We greatly appreciate foryour help with our country.
 I understand.
 That’s right, I…
 You’ve come to?
 Y-Yeah…
 Hey, you’re the girlfrom yesterday…!
 I get it now!
 You saved me, thank you!
 It just happened…
 No, seriously you saved me.
 Oh, I’m Naruto Uzumaki.What’s your name?
 Isaribi.
 So Isaribi, you’re the girlwho saved my life.
 Why did you come tothis remote area?
 A mission, of course!
 To exterminate the Demon of the Oceanthat has been troubling this country!
 It would be best to quit.
 You won't get away easily if you getinvolved with the Demon of the Ocean.
 You don't need to worry.Anyway, this is a mission.
 We were careless yesterday,
 but next time we’ll catch thatDemon of the Ocean--!
 That’s hot!
 So…you feel fine now?
 Yep! Thanks to you,it’s excellent, believe it!
 Then, once you’ve eaten that,get out.
 Huh?
 What? What?
 Wait, Isaribi!
 Hey!
 Isaribi… Wait…
 Huh, wha--?
 Monster! Go away!
 What’s this?
 It’s the work of some bratsfrom the village.
 If I let it bother me,there’s no end to it.
 Oh, Isaribi…
 Really, thank you so much.
 She’s out, the monster!
 What the…?
 Get out of here!
 You’re bad luck
 Take this!
 I-Isaribi…
 Stop it, brats!
 – Disappear!– Get out of here!
 Say something!
 Hey, stop! All of you!
 You’re taking your pranksa little too far!
 Who are you?!A friend of this monster?!
 Monster?
 Everyone’s saying it.
 Isaribi was spirited away
 and became friends withthe Demon of the Ocean!
 Don’t say such irresponsible things!
 It’s true!
 Ouch!
 – Run! 					– Stupid guy!
 – Hey! Who you calling stupid?!– Stop!
 What?! But…
 It’s okay…
 Leave me alone.
 I can’t leave you alone!
 If they keep doing that…
 I’m saying that it’s noneof your business!
 I’m the girl who wasspirited away.
 So it’s natural that peoplefind me creepy.
 But that’s not your fault!
 That doesn’t matter.
 Humans don’t let those whoare different from them
 into their group.
 So…
 Your colleague was lost at sea…
 We thought that if a boat left portbetween the evening and morning
 maybe they saw something…
 Sorry, but I don’t thinkI can help.
 Because ofthe Demon of the Ocean,
 people of this village stay awayfrom the port at those times.
 I see.
 He’s been spirited away.
 That Demon of the Oceantook someone away again.
 Mother, don’t say such reckless things.
 Spirited away…
 I heard that at the port, too.
 Can you give me details aboutthis spiriting away?
 What good will talkingabout it do?
 But…
 Please forgive me.
 This isn’t something to betalked about with outsiders.
 Can we do somethingabout that, please?
 We came here to exterminatethe Demon of the Ocean.
 Exterminate the Demonof the Ocean?
 I see…
 For a long time,
 there’s been a legend amongfishermen on Demon Island.
 A legend?
 Yes, the legend saysdon’t come near Demon Island,
 “the island where demons live.”
 Demon Island has always beena fishing area rich in fish,
 but there were many hidden reefsand it was a dangerous marine area…
 So everybody obeyed the legend.
 But one unusually cool summerabout ten years ago,
 the fish disappeared from the sea…
 We couldn’t help it,
 so my husband and I set our feetinto the dangerous marine area.
 It was a large catch.
 But when I happily cameto the surface of the ocean,
 I saw an empty boat withmy husband nowhere to be seen.
 Ever since then, one after the next,
 anyone who approachesthat island disappeared.
 Also, people who wentto search didn’t return.
 Since then people from the villagestay away from the island
 where spiriting away occurs.
 An island nobody goes near…
 That’s a peculiar story.
 Speaking of which, I heard that
 there’s a girl who returnedfrom being spirited away.
 Oh, yes… Isaribi.
 Ma’am, I’ve got another favor.
 Please tell me where she lives!
 Lady Tsunade…
 Lady Tsunade!
 Yes?
 Geez. Here’s the data you requested.
 That’s the Land of Sea’s…
 You’re worried, after all.
 Hm… Well, yes…
 The Land of Sea is where Anko,abandoned by Orochimaru, was found…
 Hey! Are you okay!
 It’s no good… I can’t remember.
 Even though I should know…
 It’s dark and cold…
 I was in pain… But…
 Calm down…Try taking a little more time.
 I’m sure I even got this strange markwhile there…
 The suggestion is deep.
 Her entire memory is most likely all…
 That’s enough…You’ve had some tough times.
 It’s okay.
 Right now, we’ll treat thisCurse Mark that’s eating away at you…
 We have to do that first.
 Lord Hokage…
 I…
 In the end, her memory didn’t return…
 A part of Anko’s memoryremains lost even now.
 So that’s what happened…
 So, this is the first time Anko’s beento the Land of Sea since that incident?
 Yes… That’s right.
 It would be nice ifit could be a catalyst
 for bringing back her memories…
 What?!
 Missed each other?!
 They came here?!
 Yeah, you should followthem right away!
 And, which way did they go?
 That way!
 That’s the direction I came!
 Damn! Everybody wait up!
 The collection ship is moving.
 I see, the only girl who returnedfrom being spirited away.
 I thought we should at least go see…
 She may have some informationabout Demon Island!
 Stop!
 Oh! That girl!
 Sensei!
 I wonder where she intends to go?
 She’s cautious.
 Let’s follow without being noticed.
 Hey, everybody! Oh, c’mon.
 If I keep going like this,
 I'll go all the way tolsaribi's house again.
 That appearance…
 It can’t be,you’re the Demon of the Ocean…?
 What?!
 I won’t let you escape!
 Master Orochimaru…This is…?
 I’m going to teach yousomething special.
 This is one of the roomswhere I develop Jutsu…
 I’d like you to help, too.
 But…if the village knew about this…
 It’s not going as smoothly as I hoped.
 It only needs one more step…
 Silly, there’s nothing to be afraid of.
 The really frightening thing isto neglect pursuing the truth.
 That girl, could she be…?
 Give it up! You can’t escape!
 You were the Demon of the Ocean!
 Hey, everyone!
 Hey!
 I finally found you!
 Naruto, you’re safe…
 But Naruto, you’re too late.
 Too late?
 We caught the Demon of the Ocean!Look, this is it.
 Oh! Oh?
 Huh, so this isthe Demon of the Ocean?!
 Isaribi…
 Huh?!
 Isaribi… You’re Isaribi, aren’t you?!
 Naruto! What are you talking about?!
 Just wait! Isaribi!lsaribi, answer me!
 Damn it!
 Wait up, you!
 Wait, don’t be rough.
 Explanation must wait.
 We’re in trouble ifwe let her escape here.
 Who are you?! Give Isaribi back!
 Like that will happen!
 She's an important guinea pig.
 If she's lost, I'm responsible for it.
 Bastard!
 Don’t chase too far…lt’ll be yesterday all over again.
 But!
 Crap!
 No question about it…
 That girl…
 Sensei!
 What in the world is going on?!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain,The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Geez! What the heckare you thinking?!
 What do you intend to do alone?!
 But I can’t just leave her be!
 Even if you were to go after her,
 you don’t even have any leadsin the first place!
 No, not quite!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 It seems there’s an island atthe center of this land’s spiriting away.
 I get it. Demon Island!

 – Good-bye, Sensei.– Yay! School's out!
 Good-bye, Iruka Sensei!
 Good-bye!
 Make sure you practice whatI taught you today, Transform Jutsu!
 And tell your family about tomorrow’sinauguration for the Fifth Hokage!
 – Okay! 					– Okay.
 Konohamaru!
 What is it, Iruka Sensei?
 Well…it’s all right.
 See you tomorrow!
 Okay… Goodbye, Iruka Sensei!
 It looks like he got over it.
 Hey, Lee!
 On your way back from rehabilitation?
 Um…yes…
 I hope you get better soon.
 Thank you very much.
 To activate each andevery cell all at once…
 If it were just one by one,it’d be a snap,
 but all of them togetheris gonna be tough.
 Still…
 The Leaf Village isin great trouble right now,
 so we must do our best!
 I think if you had Lady Tsunade takea look, you'd get better very quickly.
 It's better that you give up beinga Shinobi and look for a different path.
 Sensei and Student:The Bond of the Shinobi
 Clone Jutsu!
 Transformation Jutsu!
 Hey, young kid…
 The medal of youth is one of passion,with no looking back!
 If you work hard at it,
 I’m telling you, son,you will become a fine Shinobi! Yay!
 Who is he?He is pretty overbearing.
 Son, be ambitious! Bloom of Youth…
 Well then, adieu.
 That was the first time I met Guy Sensei.
 And then…
 Today, you have all become Genin.
 I want to hear whatyour goals are for the future.
 I don’t want to answer.
 I-I…!
 I'd like to prove thatI could become a splendid Ninja,
 even though I can’t useNinjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 Those are good serious eyes…
 You! What's so funny?!
 I'm serious!
 I will become a respectable Ninjaeven only with Taijutsu!
 Don’t you realize thatif you can’t use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu,
 you’re not a Ninja in the first place?
 Don’t you remember being toldthat you’re the first person
 to graduate from the academywho’s only able to use Taijutsu ?
 It’s not because you’re so good;it’s just that you’re unusual.
 W-Why--!
 Listen up! If you have passion,it’s not necessarily so.
 If you act with passion,
 compete with good rivalsand lift each other up,
 you can all become great Ninja!
 But you know,you have to work hard!
 Passion…
 I…was inspired by Guy Sensei.
 By his words…and his deeds.
 You’re late!17 minutes and 32 seconds late!
 Let’s not do it today, all right?
 Each of us has 48 wins!
 With a win today,one of us will pull ahead!
 I guess you won't give upeven if I say I wouldn’t want to do it.
 It’s my turn to choose the event, right?
 Right! What’s it gonna be?
 A Taijutsu battle? A 100-meter dash?
 Holding our breath under water?
 I don’t care, we could evenhave an eating contest…
 Please…
 Okay, then…
 Wh-What?!
 Rock, paper, scissors!
 Rock, paper, scissors?That’s what you choose?
 They say that your luck isone part of your skill, don’t they?
 Plus, it’s a great competitionfor testing your observational reflexes…
 R-Right.
 Do you get the feelingKakashi’s just playing around with Guy
 ‘cuz he can't be bothered?
 That’s what it looks like to me.
 I accept the battle.There’s no way I’m gonna lose!
 If I do, I’ll walk around the Leaf Village500 times on my hands!
 There you go again…
 I promise!
 Here we go…
 Another one of your special,self-imposed rules.
 He can’t do that.
 That’s ridiculous.He’s acting like a kid.
 Yeah, that’s impossible,even for Guy Sensei.
 Impossible? Reckless, I’d say!
 – Rock, paper…!– Rock, paper…!
 Here you are.
 Guy Sensei?
 How did you know I was here?
 I know everything about you.
 I heard that you skipped outon rehabilitation these past two days?
 You can’t be doing that!
 When I first became Genin…
 this is where I revealedmy dream, my aspiration.
 Neji laughed at me then,but I meant what I said.
 I'd like to prove thatI could become a splendid Ninja
 even though I can't useNinjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 At that time, you told me…
 If you act with passion,compete with rivals,
 you can become a fine Ninja.
 And that…
 In order to do that, it’d take “effort.”
 I was happy to hear that.
 – Transform! 					– Transform!
 Because while at the academy…
 no one, not one friend or teacher,said that kind of thing to me.
 You put me at ease…
 You opened up a pathjust when I was unsure of myself.
 I realized all I had to dowas try my best.
 And when I complained that
 all my efforts couldn’t matchthe others’ natural talents,
 you told me that I hada natural talent for effort.
 That was when I learned the importanceof believing in my own strength.
 The chance of a successful surgeryis probably 50%, at best.
 But…this is one time…even if I try my best…!
 and even if I believe in myself,there’s nothing in the world I can do!
 Guy Sensei… Please tell me…!
 Please tell me.Can I become like you?
 Why did this kind of thinghappen only to me?
 Because I have my ownWay of Ninja to follow,
 my own dreams and aspirationsthat I have to protect and
 prove to the world evenif it means dying for…
 What should I do?!
 The Eight Inner Gates…
 Is this the Forbidden Jutsu thatwill destroy the body of the practitioner?
 Please tell me!
 I’m prepared for the worst.
 Please teach me that Forbidden Jutsu!
 Everything is…for my dream!
 That means everything to me!
 You tried to become a great Ninjarelying only on Taijutsu…
 Until now, that’s all you had.
 It must be so painful for you…
 Now that it seems that your dreams
 and all your wishesare being cruelly taken away.
 It does not matter what his wishes are,he should give up on becoming a Shinobi.
 Lee…
 If you want to be free of that pain,you have to prepare yourself!
 Does it mean…to prepare to give up my dreams?
 If you lose your dreams,
 you will undergo pain even greaterthan what you feel now.
 Neither you nor I would be able togo on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
 What fools we are…
 Lee! Have the surgery!
 How’s it going with Cell Activation Jutsu?
 It’s all about the Chakra, but…
 There are so many kinds of cells…
 skin cells, internal organ cells,muscular cells…
 You know, it’s just a tad difficultto activate all of them at once.
 What’s that?“Just a tad,” you say?
 Are you testing me?
 Oh no!
 I’m declaring my trust in you.
 I don’t know why,but just a while ago…
 I was remembering the timewhen you and Kakashi Sensei
 were competingwith rock, paper, scissors.
 At that time, Kakashi Sensei said
 that your luck isone part of your skill, right?
 This surgery is also fifty-fifty,live or die…
 But…
 it’s not a game ofrock, paper, scissors!
 Do you remember what happenedafter that, Lee?
 500 times around…lt’s a promise! Yay!
 What's he doing?!
 Shoot!
 If I lose, I’ll walk 500 timesaround the Leaf Village, on my hands!
 It's a promise!
 He can’t do that! That’s stupid.He’s acting like a kid.
 Hah! This is nothing!
 Wh-What are you doing here, Lee?
 Why are you doing this?
 Kakashi Sensei is not here.ln fact, no one is watching.
 When a man stands cool witha Nice-guy pose in front of others,
 he should keep his promise,even if it kills him!
 It’s a promise!
 What?
 Why do you always do that?
 Whenever you’re about to startdoing something,
 why do you always come upwith some kind of crazy rule.
 Good question, Lee.
 You really know howto get to the point.
 OK, I’ll tell you.But remember, you can’t tell anyone else.
 What’s the answer?
 Making self-rules is nothing less thana practice which brings me victory!
 S-Self-rules…?
 Are you ready?
 The point of these rules is that,when you’re going after something,
 they push you into a real tough spot…
 It’s about chaining yourself down.
 For example, on the other sideof the hellish rule that
 “If I lose at rock, scissors, paper,I’ll do 500 laps” is the idea that
 “If I do 500 laps,
 there’s no way I won’t be ableto beat Kakashi next time.”
 They hold power,the potential of the heavens.
 Y-Yes…
 By being chained downto doing 500 laps,
 it makes you get serious.
 Even about things likerock, paper, scissors competitions,
 which are so trifling otherwise.
 And, even if you lose,walking around the village 500 times
 give you the benefitof extremely intense training.
 I see!
 OK, I’ve gotta do a little more.Here we go!
 I’m going with you!I have my own “self-rule” which is--
 Hey! Hey! Don’t push yourself, Lee.
 If I can’t keep up with you, I'll…
 try even harder!
 That is, I’ll aim to be like you.
 And if I keep trying,I’ll be able to become a great Ninja!
 All right! If that’s the case,then I have an addition to my rule!
 If you can’t keep up with meall the way to the end…
 I’ll put every ounce ofmy being into training you!
 If I train you with all my being,you’ll be able to turn into a fine Ninja!
 I promise!
 Huh, that’s right.
 That was the first time you told me aboutthe ""self-rule,"" wasn’t it?
 Your surgery will be a success
 because you have worked hardall the way through.
 You have the power to bringyour own future in the heavens.
 And in the one in a thousand…
 no, one in a million chancethat something goes wrong…
 I will die with you!
 Ever since I met you,
 my Way of Ninja has been tonurture you into a fine Ninja.
 I promise you!
 Neither you nor I would be ableto go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
 What fools we are…
 G-Guy Sensei!
 OK, let’s go, Lee!
 Yes, sir!
 Lady Tsunade!
 From this day forward,
 I am the ruler of the Village Hiddenin the Leaves, the Fifth Hokage!
 I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel itthe precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
 Darn! He has no holein his defense.
 Being impatient won'tdo any good, Naruto.
 Let's utilize the next mission.
 That's right. The next missionrequires an overnight stay.
 – Our chance will be at the inn.– Roger that!
 Once we get to the inn,we'll wait until he's defenseless…
 – and then… 					– and then…
 – unmask him at once!– unmask him at once!

1,"A long time ago, a powerful demon foxappeared with nine tails.
 With its powerful tails,
 it could smash mountainsand create tidal waves.
 A band of Ninjas rose todefend their village from attack.
 We have to wait untilthe Fourth Hokage gets here!
 We can't let it get any closerto our village!
 One great Ninja was able toimprison the monster,
 but died in the process.
 This Ninja was known as…the Fourth Hokage.
 Naruto!
 Why did you do such a thing?!
 You're really gonna get it this time!
 I don't care!
 You know your problem?
 You can't do the things I do!
 Only I can do this!
 I'm better than all of you!Believe it!
 There's a problem, sir!
 Lord Hokage!
 What is it?
 Did that Naruto do something again?
 Yes. He climbed ontothe Mountainside Images…
 And he vandalized andgraffitied all over them!
 Wait!
 Ha ha…
 Why should I?
 Hey, Naruto!
 How did you suddenly get here,lruka Sensei?
 The question is what are you doing herewhen you should be in class now?
 Now listen, Naruto.
 You failed the last graduation testand the one before that.
 This is no timeto be goofing off, you fool!
 We will have a re-test onthe Transformation Jutsu!
 Even those who already passedwill take it!
 Whaaaat?!
 Sakura Haruno. Here I go…
 Transform!
 OK!
 I did it!
 Cha!
 Did you see that, Sasuke?
 Next, Sasuke Uchiha.
 Yes.
 O-OK.
 Next, Naruto Uzumaki.
 This is a real pain.
 And it's all your fault.
 Like I care!!
 OK…
 Good luck, Naruto…
 Transform!
 How was it?
 I call it the ""Sexy Jutsu""!
 You fool!Stop making idiotic spells!
 Darn…
 Darn…
 I won't let you go homeunless you clean that all up.
 I don't care…
 There's nobody home anyway.
 Naruto...
 What is it this time?
 What I meant was…
 If you clean up all that mess,I'll buy you ramen tonight.
 Huh?!
 Yes!I-I will finish it no time!
 Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!
 Naruto.
 Why did you vandalize those faces?
 Don't you know whothe Hokage leaders are?
 Of course, I do!
 I know they earned the titleLord Hokage
 because they were the best Ninjaof their time, right?
 Especially the Fourth Hokagewas a hero
 who saved the village fromthe nine-tail demon fox.
 Then why did you do that?
 Because I'll become a Hokage myself.
 And I'll be the greatest Hokageof all time!
 So that everyone will finallylearn to accept me!
 By the way, Sensei,I have a favor to ask.
 You want another bowl?
 Mmmm…No…
 Can I borrow that Leaf headbandfor a while?
 This?
 No no!
 This is worn only by those whohave graduated from Ninja Academy.
 Tomorrow, you will…
 You're so mean!
 So that's why you took offyour goggles…
 Humph...One more bowl please!
 We are now about to beginthe graduation test.
 When your name is called,proceed to the next classroom.
 The test is on the Clone Jutsu.
 Oh no…
 Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu!
 But still…I will do it no matter what!
 Clone Jutsu!
 Disqualified!
 Iruka Sensei.
 His physical coordinationand stamina are excellent.
 And he managed to come upwith something.
 Isn't that enoughfor him to pass?
 Mizuki Sensei...All the others created three or more clones.
 Naruto created just one.
 And it's practically useless.I can't give him a passing mark.
 I 'm a Ninja now!
 You did well. That's my son.
 Congratulations for your graduation.
 I'll cook something good tonight!
 Look at that one.
 It's that boy.I hear he's the only one who failed.
 Serves him right.
 Imagine what would happenif he became a Ninja.
 Isn't that the boywho is actually…
 Hey! We're not supposed totalk about that.
 Iruka.We need to talk later.
 Yes, sir.
 Iruka Sensei isn't tryingto be mean to you.
 Then why only me?
 He wants you to become strongfrom the bottom of his heart.
 You both don't have parents.
 But I really wanted to graduate.
 Heh... I guess I have no choice…
 I'll let you in on a big secret.
 Secret?
 Iruka.
 What is it, Lord Hokage?
 I know how you feel. But…
 Naruto also grew up without knowingthe love of his parents…like you.
 Let me go!
 My mom and dad arestill out there fighting!
 Wake up, Iruka Sensei!
 What's the matter?
 Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!
 I heard that Naruto…stole the Scroll of Sealing.
 The Scroll of Sealing?!
 Let's see…
 The first Jutsu is…Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?
 What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?
 Lord Hokage!We can't forgive him!
 This is not just a prank!
 The Scroll is a dangerous itemthat the First Hokage sealed!
 Depending on its use…
 It will be a major disaster ifit is taken out of the village!
 Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!
 Yes, sir!
 Where did you go…Naruto?
 I will tell everyone in the villageabout this and eliminate Naruto…
 Then the Scroll of Sealingwill be mine!
 Hey you, Naruto!
 You found me..
 And I've only learned one Jutsu.
 He's been practicing the Jutsu…
 until he's becomethis exhausted and dirty…?
 Listen, listen!I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!
 You're gonna let me graduateif I can do it!
 Isn't it true that I can graduate ifI can do one of the Jutsu written here?
 Who told you that?
 Mizuki Sensei. He told meabout this scroll, and this place…
 Mizuki did?!
 I'm impressed you found this place.
 I see now…how it is.
 Naruto, give me that scroll.
 Wait, wait…What's going on here?
 Naruto! Never give him that scroll!
 It is a dangerous object that containsforbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.
 Mizuki used you in order toget it for himself!
 W-Wha--?
 Naruto, Iruka is only afraid ofyou holding that scroll!
 Huh?
 What are you saying, Mizuki!Don't let him fool you, Naruto!
 I will tell you the truth.
 Idiot! Don't do that!
 After an incident 12 years ago,a rule was created.
 A rule?
 That is, Naruto, a rule everybodybut you knows.
 Except me?! 					What is it?
 Stop it, Mizuki!
 The rule forbids anyone from revealingthat you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!
 Huh?
 You are actually the Demon,Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 who killed Iruka's parents anddestroyed our village!
 Stop it!
 Everyone has beendeceiving you ever since.
 Didn't you find it strange?
 Why everyone hated you so much?
 No! No! No! No! No!
 Naruto…
 Nobody accepts you.That's why Iruka hates you so much!
 Iruka... Naruto grew upwithout the love of parents.
 Everyone avoids him likethe plague after what happened.
 That's why he keeps misbehaving.
 It's the only way for him to getany attention or acknowledgement.
 He pretends to be tough,but inside he is really hurting.
 Die, Naruto!
 Naruto! 					Get down!
 Why…?
 Because you and I are the same.
 After my parents died,
 nobody paid attention to meor gave me any support.
 I wasn't a good student in school.
 I was the class clown…because I wanted people to notice me.
 I couldn't get noticed through excellence,so I kept doing stupid things.
 It was so hard.
 Isn't that right, Naruto?
 You felt so lonely…right?And you suffered inside, right?
 I'm sorry, Naruto….
 If I had been more responsible,maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.
 Don't make me laugh!
 Iruka has always hated you,ever since you killed his parents!
 He's just saying all thatto get the Scroll of Sealing back!
 Naruto!
 Narutoooooo!
 He is not the type of kidwho will change his mind.
 He will take revenge againstour village using that scroll!
 Didn't you see his eyes?Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.
 No…Naruto…isn't…like that at all!
 All I want is to kill Narutoand get the scroll.
 I'll take care of you later!
 I-I won't let you…
 Well, well.
 Mizuki has a big mouth!
 Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.
 He might unleashthe power locked up inside him.
 The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.
 There's a slight chancehe might actually release
 the Nine-Tailed Fox Spiritsealed inside him!
 If that happens…
 I've found him!
 Naruto!
 Everything that Mizuki saidwas a lie!
 Give me that scroll, quick!Mizuki is after the scroll!
 It can't be…
 Why is it, Naruto?
 How…
 did you know I wasn't Iruka…?
 Because I'm Iruka.
 I see.
 What's in it for you to protectthe one who killed your family?
 I'm not gonna let a stupid idiotlike you get that scroll!
 You're the idiot.Naruto is the same as me.
 Same?
 Anyone can do whateverhe wants once he has the scroll.
 There is no way that that monster…
 that Fox Spirit, won't take advantageof the power of that scroll!
 You're right…
 I guess it was true all along!
 See, Iruka Sensei never reallycared for me at all!
 ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.
 But Naruto is different!
 I know that he is an exceptional student.
 He works very hard,
 and he's single-mindedand clumsy at the same time.
 No one accepts him, but he knowsthe meaning of human suffering.
 He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.
 He's Naruto Uzumaki ofthe Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 You are so gullible. 					lruka!
 I was gonna take you down later,but I have changed my mind.
 Die!
 I guess this is the end for me…
 Naruto?!
 You surprised me there, freak.
 If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,I'll kill you!
 Shut up! I can take care of a kidlike you with a single blow!
 Why don't you try then?I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!
 Let's see you try!Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto! You've…
 Those aren't just images but actual clones!That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
 What's this…?
 What's the matter? 					C'mon!
 Weren't you gonna get mewith one blow? Here!
 In that case…I'll come to you.
 I kinda got carried away.lruka Sensei, are you okay?
 Yeah.
 He's really something.
 Maybe it is true.
 Maybe he will surpass allthe Hokage leaders…
 Naruto, come over here.I'd like to give you something.
 Has anyone found Naruto yet?
 No.
 Darn, this is going to be bad…
 There's no need to worry anymore.
 Lord Hokage!
 He'll be back soon.
 Sensei, how much longer?
 OK, you may open your eyes now.
 Congratulations…on your graduation.
 In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!
 Iruka Sensei!
 That hurts!
 Naruto…
 I was going to lecture to you...
 that the road gets more difficultnow that you're a Ninja.
 But I guess I'll just wait to tell youthat until we get to the ramen stand…
 W-What do you want, you little shrimp?Quit following me!
 You're smaller than me and
 you're saying that you're gonnabecome the Fifth Hokage?
 I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage'sgrandson or not.
 It's not that easy to be a Hokage!
 If you want it that bad,you're gonna have to beat me first!

191,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived throughthe changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength,(just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned withinthe flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down,we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other,we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings,Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeatagainst the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet,Under the same flag of pain
 I won’t count on you.
 I will go by myself.
 Wait. 					I 'll go too.
 I promised Hinata that I would definitelyprotect you, Princess!
 With Hinata…?
 She fought with the second Janinand got hurt badly…
 Hinata did…?
 You guys said that you didn’t acceptthe mission of protecting me.
 Then why do you concernyourselves with me…?
 I…
 Not only me,but Hinata and Choji, too.
 We don't like it when somebody before usis hurt or sad… That's all.
 Well, let’s go!
 If we pass throughthe valley ahead of us,
 we’ll get to the town.
 If we do that,
 they probably won’t chase usall the way there!
 Forecast: Death!Cloudy with Chance of Sun!
 Too bad, but you guys won’tbe able to reach that village.
 Since you guys are goingto die here!
 Wh-Why is he floating in the air?
 Hey kid, I bet a low-class Ninja like youcan’t even imagine my Jutsu.
 Take this!
 Naruto!
 I’m okay.
 But what just flew at me?
 Don’t waste your time fighting me.
 I have already capturedall three of your friends.
 What?
 Just hand over the girl.
 If you do that I’ll spare your friends.
 Choji and Hinata…
 So, what are you going to do kid?
 Naruto… Are you going toabandon me too?
 Oh no, this princess istelling you to save her,
 and let your friends die.
 Well, I don’t mind that kind of thinkingsince it’s the same as mine.
 Same as yours?
 That’s right.
 If someone is useful,
 then you should make useof them
 even though they may beyour siblings.
 There is one thing I needto thank you guys for.
 Thank us? 					For what?!
 For doing in Ruiga and Jiga.
 I was going to put an end to them myselfsooner or later anyways.
 What…?!
 It was clear that they wouldsoon tell me,
 “Big Brother, give us the propertyand the money too.”
 Three feudal lords are not necessaryin one country.
 And you still callyourselves brothers?!
 It doesn’t matter.
 Even though it’s my parentsor my brothers.
 I'll make use of anything I can.
 Now, give her to me.
 I refuse.
 I see.
 Naruto…
 A person who would abandonhis siblings
 would never keep his promisewith me.
 Well, that’s true.
 It’s impossible, Naruto!
 You don’t even knowwhat kind of Jutsu it is!
 That doesn’t matter!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Take this!
 What is this guy?
 There’s something hard aroundhis body that I can’t see…
 Naruto!
 I'm sorry, but none ofyour Ninjutsu work on me.
 Not even one.
 Damn it!
 What?!
 What is that?
 Crystallized ice…?
 I can gather water vapor in the air
 and instantly turn itinto crystallized ice.
 So the things that just attacked mewere ice Shuriken.
 Man! It’s hard to seeif it’s transparent ice.
 Just that is not too interesting.
 What is this great senseof danger?
 I’m sure his Jutsu has already started!
 Where is it, where is itcoming from?!
 Kid, do you knowtoday's weather forecast?
 Weather forecast?
 Cloudy and partly sunny.
 It’s a good weather for you to die.
 What is this?
 What?!
 Look out!
 Damn it!
 Naruto!
 That’s a lens!
 Lens?!
 Yup, I turned the crystallized iceinto lens
 to gather the sunlight and shoot it.
 So, I can’t really control it,but it’ll be an instant when you die.
 As soon as the battle conditionat the Land of Green is prepared,
 I’ll burn up the surrounding countrieswith this Jutsu.
 This way!
 It’s no use.
 I could even see things that area thousand miles away.
 I found you.
 Naruto… Why do you protect me?
 I wonder why…
 I don’t know either.
 Naruto…
 Haruna!
 While I distract him, run!
 Don’t even think you guyscould get away from my Jutsu
 by doing that!
 You decided to hand meover the princess?
 Who would hand over Harunato the likes of you!
 What a fool.
 I’m telling you that if you hand methe selfish princess
 and just go back to the village,I’ll let your friends go.
 I promised with Hinata thatI will save Haruna!
 Just to keep a promisewith your friend,
 you’re gonna risk your life to fightin a hopeless battle, huh…?
 You’re just like the feudal lordin Land of Green.
 A good-natured big fool!
 Same as my father…?!
 You’re just like the feudal lordin Land of Green.
 A good-natured big fool!
 Same as my father…?!
 This is what the feudal lordfoolishly said
 to us who were trying to take overthe Land of Green:
 “Please do not torment the peoplein this country.”
 I beg you!
 I don’t care what happens to me,
 but please promise me one thing!
 This is a small weak countrysurrounded by big countries.
 Without the powers of the people,the country cannot prosper!
 In order for the country to prosper,
 we must take care ofeach individual people
 and not sacrifice a single life!
 I want you to consider the peopleas a family
 and not torment them.
 I am the feudal lord!
 It doesn’t matter what I doto the people, right?
 That’s why…
 That's why this country hasbeen at peace until now!
 Peace doesn’t matter to me.
 All I need to do is use the peopleas the stepping stones
 and feather my nest!
 And because of that kindof good nature,
 his daughter was takenas a hostage!
 What do you mean?!
 It seems like it was ten years ago.
 A lot of the people were sacrificedby the pressure of the big country…
 Riots occurred in the countryand the country came close to corruption.
 It was a bitter decision…
 I had no choice but to letmy daughter,
 who is more important than my life,taken as a hostage.
 I know that Haruna willnot forgive me…
 A cold-hearted father who sacrificedhis own daughter
 just for the peace of the country.
 Why don’t you askyour daughter directly?!
 In the after life!
 My father was…killed!
 What an outrageouslygood-natured person, huh?
 You’re wrong,he was a great feudal lord!
 Naruto…
 Listen!
 There are two kinds of human beingsin this world.
 Those who use others,and those who get used!
 In my case, I will get tothe top using anyone,
 whether it’s my parents or my friends.
 You! I’ll never forgive you!
 Shut up!
 D-Damn…!
 Die!
 Naruto…
 You can’t move anymore?!
 You’re not the one…
 It was because of Haruna’s fatherthat this country was peaceful…
 The person who is goingto succeed this country is…
 The person is…
 Haruna!
 Stop!
 Stupid!
 Why aren’t you running away?!
 Kill me! If you kill me,your goal will be fulfilled, right?!
 Naruto, Naruto has nothingto do with this!
 So both the parent and daughterare naïve, after all.
 Why not complain to your fatherin the afterlife
 for making you sacrifice your lifefor the country?
 How scary…
 Y-You!
 It’s time for you to die, kid.
 I’m not a kid!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki.
 I’m not going to hand overthe Land of Green
 to a person like you!
 Naruto!
 Die!
 What?!
 No…way…
 But kid, it’s too late eventhough you took me down…
 The Land of Green withouta feudal lord will collapse
 due to the war betweenthe large countries over its territory.
 It’s too bad,but that’s not gonna happen!
 Shizune!
 It’s a pain,but we came to get you guys!
 Shikamaru!
 But…I didn’t ask you guysto come get us!
 But you look pretty beaten up.
 No no, this is…
 Naruto!
 Choji! Hinata! Yurinojou!
 Everyone was safe!
 Yeah.
 We were rescued bythe people of Leaf Village.
 Huh? Oh yeah,why are you guys here?
 We received notice of a coupin the Land of Green
 and Lady Tsunade herself ordered meto come…
 Princess Haruna’s father wasvery kind to Lady Tsunade and me.
 My father…?
 Please forgive us, when we arrived,your father was already…
 I see…I’ve causedso much trouble for you.
 Damn!
 The position of the feudal lordthat I finally got a hold of…
 But, then the surrounding countriesare not going to stay quiet.
 It’s okay.
 An announcement has been sent outto the neighboring countries
 in the name of the next feudal lord.
 Under your name, Princess Haruna.
 Then we don’t need to worry aboutthe country getting attacked anymore!
 Haruna!
 Haruna…
 Do it.
 You want to take revengewith your own hands, right?
 I’ll do the same if I were you.
 I am…not like you!
 Haruna…
 Kikunojou, please forgive me.
 Princess Haruna.
 Here, Kikunojou could look overthe Land of Green.
 I'm sure that Kikunojouwill watch over everyone forever.
 Well, Lady Haruna,we are leaving now.
 Thank you, Naruto, Choji,and Hinata.
 Shizune, I’d like to ask a special favor.
 What is it, Princess Haruna?
 My role is to take over my father’s willto protect the peace of Land of Green.
 In order to do that,
 I want to borrow some helpfrom the Leaf Village.
 Our help?
 Yes.
 I want you to lend me Naruto.
 Huh?!
 Please, Naruto.
 Princess Haruna.
 I want you to help mewith the revival of the Land of Green.
 I…I…
 I’m sorry,but I can’t really do that.
 I need to go back to my friends.
 And I need to do more trainingand become much stronger.
 There are things that I must do.
 It’s all for my precious friends!
 Then I can’t take you awayfrom them…
 Naruto, I’ll promise that I will domy best to keep my father’s wishes
 and strive for a peaceful countrywhere no one will be sacrificed.
 Yeah!
 It’s a promise!
 Thank you! Naruto!
 Good-bye! Everybody!
 We’ll come back someday!
 Bye!
 See ya!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign,was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park,I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three,I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes,as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNightWith every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar playedin a soft minor key
 No! He’s looking over here!
 Of course, he’ll look!Stop complaining and attack him!
 No, no, it’s impossible!
 He just moved right now!He moved, Naruto!
 Of course, he’ll move!Hey, approach him more!
 No, no, no. This is my limit.
 Come on, just give hima one good hit!
 No, the enemy is that thing you know?
 A monster, a monster!
 This wouldn’t be a mission!
 Next time:“Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!”

 I just want to conveymy simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with youand live for the moment
 Still that incidentwill continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind,let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realizethat it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks,creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortexand melting away
 Don’t forget your objective…
 Don’t go!
 Thank you…
 Sasuke…
 Formation!               The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!
 It’s already four o’clockin the morning…
 That Fifth Hokage isa real slave driver.
 She ought to retrievethe documents she forgot herself…
 Huh… What’s the matter?
 Hey! Wake up!
 You’ll catch cold if you sleepin a place like this.
 Thank you…
 Huh!
 Sasuke!
 Good work…
 Fifth Hokage! You were asleepjust now, weren’t you?
 When you made usgo to fetch the documents!
 And only you got to sleep!
 More importantly, Lady Hokage,
 there’s somethingI want to report to you.
 What is it?
 What did you just say?!
 Is that true?!
 Yes…
 According to Sakura Haruno,it appears that there’s no mistake…
 Unbelievable…That they should already be on the move…
 In addition to getting what I want…
 This time, I will completelydestroy Leaf Village.
 So what that pervert wants...
 is the Uchiha’s powers, huh…
 Izumo! Kotetsu!
 There’s somebodyI want you to bring here!
 Hurry up and eat, Shikamaru!Your Dad’s mission starts today, too!
 There’s not that much timefor morning training!
 OK, OK.
 One OK is enough!
 Nag, nag, nag from earlyin the morning…
 I wonder who it could beso early in the morning?
 Hey…Dad…
 What is it?
 Why did you marrya hard-edged woman like Mom?
 Let’s see now…
 Even though Mom's like that,she smiles gently sometimes…
 Maybe that’s why…
 Is that the only reason?
 Shikamaru!
 A messenger of the Fifth Hokageis here.
 Sasuke Uchiha apparently slipped outof the village late last night.
 And…there is almost no mistake
 that he is headed forthe Village Hidden in the Sound!
 Slipped out?! Why…
 Because he was enticed bythat Orochimaru!
 W-W-Wait a minute!
 Why does Sasuke have to be enticedby a risky guy like that?!
 The reason doesn’t matter.ln any case, there’s no time.
 You will perform your first missionas a Chunin…
 So all I have to dois bring Sasuke back?
 As long as there aren’tany enemies around,
 that shouldn’t betoo much of a hassle…
 Yes… However, not only is timeof the essence on this mission,
 but it may turn into somethingquite difficult.
 Huh?!
 There is a strong possibility that
 those under the control of Orochimaruare guiding Sasuke.
 This is turning into a real painin the neck.
 That guy… I held him in high respectin so many different ways…
 In that case, please give mea four-man team
 composed only of Jonin and Chunin.
 I’m afraid I can’t do that…
 Huh! Why?!
 You already knowthe answer to that…
 Right now, only the barest minimumnumber of Jonin have been left behind
 and the others have allleft the village on missions.
 Within the next 30 minutes,
 I want you to gather all the Genin youconsider the best, and leave this village!
 It’s a drag but…
 I know the guy,so I just can’t just let the matter go.
 What shall be, shall be…
 There’s one guyI want to recommend.
 What! You’ve gotta be kidding!
 You are such a drag startingso early in the morning…
 But why this guy?
 That jerk!
 Hey, just wait here!
 I’ll change my clothes immediately!
 So, do you have your eye…
 on any other guys besides mewho are excellent?
 Yeah…
 Wake up! Hey!
 You said excellent guys, right…
 Can’t be helped…
 Potato chips?
 They’re barbecued meat flavor…you help out too!
 Huh?!
 Here he comes!
 Even if it is just potato chips,
 I won’t let anybody else havethe last piece, no matter who you are.
 Choji and I have worked asa team for many years,
 so coordinating with himis easiest for me.
 I understand that,
 but in this kind of situation,one would normally solicit Shino first!
 Oh, shut up.
 Fat chance...!
 Shino is on a special missionwith his father.
 Hey…don’t tell me…
 Right. He's in.
 No way...!
 I see… Sounds interesting…
 It looks like it was worth getting up earlyand going for a walk, doesn’t it?
 Shikamaru, what about the other guys?
 I’d like to take my time to look for some,but we’re pressed for time.
 If we don’t find anybody elseby the time we leave the village,
 it will be just us!
 It appears that your operationwas a success.
 Yeah…
 Is it okay for youto be released already?
 I was told that I would be ableto undertake light training soon.
 I see…
 I see…
 It’s a hassle,but the more people the better…
 Damn… At a time like this, I…
 Lee! Do what you need to do.
 I’ll climb these steps alonestarting tomorrow!
 Lee…
 I’ll be fine! You go!
 We’re at our time limit!
 Well, I’ve assembled five people…
 All right! Everybody, follow me!
 Hey…
 Hey, Naruto…
 I’m supposed to be the squad leader.Though it sure is a drag…
 You really think everything will be okayif things are left in your hands?
 You don’t seem very reliable…
 What’s up with you actinglike the boss, Naruto?
 Although being ordered about bysome unmotivated guy like Shikamaru
 doesn’t sit right with me either…
 But Shikamaru is already a Chunin!
 We have to follow his orders.
 What that means is thatthe elders of the village recognized him
 as capable of being a leader.
 Since that’s the case,come up with some strategy and plan.
 From what I heard,there are enemies
 and there’s a strong possibilitythat they’re gonna ambush us.
 For a start,as this is a rescue operation,
 we will be in the positionof pursuit.
 In other words,the enemy can easily gain the initiative.
 Therefore, I will decideon a deployment formation
 that will respond quicklyto any assault by the enemy.
 If you ignore me andmove of your own accord,
 we will all die.
 We will go in a single file formation.
 First of all,the all-important spearhead will be…
 Kiba, that’s you!
 You and Akamaru go onwalks year round
 and are therefore well-versed in the terrainand geography of the Land of Fire.
 And since your nose isvery sensitive,
 you can track Sasukewith your sense of smell and,
 you can distinguish booby trapsthat carry the enemy’s scent
 which makes themeasy to find…
 And moreover, you and Akamaru asa pair will be extremely efficient
 in compensating for the weaknessof a single file formation to assault.
 And…second in line will be me,the squad leader.
 I can give ordersas required in any situation
 from my positiondirectly behind Kiba
 and can give orders to those behind meusing only hand signals.
 And in the middle...in the number three position is Naruto.
 The middle position isthe best for you,
 since you're capableof executing quick moves
 and are able to respond immediatelyto anything in front or behind.
 You're the cornerstone...And you have Shadow Clone, too.
 And fourth in line is Choji.
 You. You don't have speed,
 but your ability to strike is the bestamong the squad members.
 Line leader Kiba, I, and Narutowill launch a surprise attack
 and I’ll use you to launchthe deciding blow.
 In other words, your role isto attack the routed enemy.
 And then, on the tail endwill be you, Neji…
 You are assigned tothe most difficult position of rear lookout.
 You will use your Byakuganto constantly check
 that there are no loopholesin the ranks.
 Got it? Take a careful look at this.
 Use this diagram to verifythe radius of your assigned watch.
 Kiba watches the front,
 I’m responsible fora wide forward view,
 Naruto watches left, Choji right,and Neji…
 Using your Byakugan,you cover the entire area to the rear.
 I want to familiarize myselfwith our current military potential.
 Let me check all the Ninja equipmenteach of you currently has…
 I will commit thatto memory straight away.
 Any questions?
 Even though he just assembledhis men a short while ago,
 he’s already createdthe best possible formation…
 If not, I want to tell youthe most important thing last.
 Sasuke and I aren’t close friends.
 In fact, I don’t particularly like him.
 However, he is also a Shinobi belongingto the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 He is a comrade!
 Therefore, I will put my lifeon the line to help him!
 That’s the wayof the Leaf Village.
 In this case, even I can’t just sit backand be a sluggard.
 Because I am responsiblefor your lives.
 Wow… You’re acting kind oflike a Chunin, aren’t you?!
 Okay then, as soon as he's checkedour Ninja tools, we’ll depart.
 Everybody, take out your Ninja tools.
 Sasuke wouldn’t fall victimto that kind of guy’s enticement…
 He’s alreadya really powerful guy,
 so he wouldn’t need to dothat kind of thing! I guarantee it!
 Damn… Why, Sasuke…?!
 All right! Let’s go!
 Wait!
 Sakura!
 I heard the whole storyfrom Lady Hokage.
 I’m sorry, but I can’t take you alongon this mission.
 Even you weren’t ableto convince Sasuke, right?
 All that can be done now is for usto use force to convince him…
 Sakura, your role in this has ended.
 Which means, Sakura,that you and Sasuke…?!
 Sakura…
 Naruto… This is a…once in a lifetime request...
 Please bring…please bring Sasuke back.
 I couldn’t do it!I wasn’t able to stop Sasuke!
 At this point, the only personwho would be able to stop Sasuke…
 who would be able to save him…
 is you…Naruto…
 You like Sasuke so much,don’t you, Sakura?
 I understand to my very core
 how painful it must befor you right now, Sakura.
 Sakura, there’s one thingI want to ask you.
 Huh?
 How do you feel about…Naruto?
 Thwarting someone’s love seemsto have become natural to him.
 He actually seems to be enjoyingmy suffering.
 Naruto doesn’t understandthe least thing about me.
 He’s just annoying.
 Naruto…thank you…
 I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail!I promise that on my life!
 You always understood me…
 You always helped me…
 Naruto…
 Hey, hey, Naruto!
 You really think you’re gonna be okaysaying that kind of thing?!
 Sure! I will not go back on my word.
 That’s my Way of the Ninja!
 All right! Let’s hurry up and go!
 We’ve lost a little time…Let’s hurry!
 OK!
 Naruto struck the pose ofa nice guy as he said that…
 It’ll all be all right now.
 I’m positive…I’m positive that it will all go well!
 Master Sasuke… Around here will do,don’t you think?
 We’ve already exitedthe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 What is that?
 To tell you the truth,
 Orochimaru has given usone important task…
 So…what is it?
 It will be necessary for youto die once…
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a personbroken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around (round around)
 Shake shake shakeLet’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 From here on up, there's more dangerof traps and ambushes.
 – Stay alert and use all your senses.– Roger that!
 – Find the enemy before he gets you.– You can count on me!
 – And any signs of the enemy--– Right!
 Say, are you listening?!
 Not to worry.No matter who the enemy may be,
 I'll thrash him withmy new technique!
